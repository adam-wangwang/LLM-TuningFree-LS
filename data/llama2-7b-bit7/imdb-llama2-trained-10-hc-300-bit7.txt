. Our male lead was Mark Rutte, ex-boyfriend of the bumbly yet fierce star Reeves, who wanted something more from his love life than a meaningeless fling with the bartending-waiter love-goddess. Of his new career as a writer. Fucking is secondary. But Reeve' s character is looking to satisfy her primeness. Which, of course, gets in the away from Mark R. So, Reevess goes back in the night trying for the orgy, but gets only one handy man after another, until they all are lining up. All that funny stuff with Reeves is an illusion. R. is not looking for something serious or that something only happens, he is just trying his luck. What happens with him that he makes it so difficult for a woman who lovingly lovingly want a good time? Rutte notices the beauty of that bawdy sex, but then deciding to take his career serious. The film is like a poem or a song with its hypnotic cinematically photography. I never like the Rutters, but here he is trying in every possible effort for something good. Who cares he would hit Reeve on the head for that? Anja?! Bummer to a good career? In the end they break up, but still R. has the chance to say something to her. This
an incredibly low production, doesn’t change that. The story is amazeingly engulfed in the environment, the visuals and the film-equaton of emotion. And the maturity of the storytelling, the performances and direction makes this a very involving film despite its short running time. I can’ read a lot about it, because I think it is something that has to bite you and let rip to be able to get it and process whats happened. In a way you get the metaphor of youths meeting darkness, but at the same moment, darkness has been found on the other side of every corner. A dark side to the emotion, or the world itself is dark because you discover it. But I think that makes this an even more hard-core story for the target audience. It’s not for everybody, it’ s just that good – and it has that simple quality of a good story , a nice flow of emotive quality and the perfect flow to the film in terms of form and direction. Everything, editing, direction, mood, the entire film has that kind of special grip that makes you want to experience it again and understand. And that, the factthat I don’t know how it’s possible to do it for so little, to do that to such a great degree and the fact that the result doesn t feel limited at all, they’re all good reasons to be proud
isn`t the best in terms the quality of the writing, but it is better then a couple we have in the series. The crazy amount characters and sub-story lines was a little dauting, but I managed all right in the end. A lot to do with Huckleberry, that character was really shat this time round, which almost stopped the flow, but fortunately HB was on the scene. Good story, few high points and some low points. Could have been done much easier and made more accessible and belivable. I give this 8 out 1 Mirembe. Stick with this series, as all the issues will eventual get clearer and deeper; this may be a tad off the mark. With all the previous experience this should come in hand in due time!

Italy, SEDUCIONE UNISEX is a rather more down-tocome affair than its peers, which may of its time were well worn. Its stars, Anna Maria Rosati and Geretta Gerina, are both adequate (if somewhat wooden) with respectt to acting, and the cast of supporting players deliver the narration through the script’s twists and turns (a rarity in the goreme!). The plot (a strange “inbreed murder on a country estate in the ‘5o’s” type affair), which has the twist of seeming like a locked-room murder mystery, really should be attributed solely to the script' for its clever twisty-style structure. As for special effects, they’re limited in numbers and not very special at this stage of Fulci's carrer; however what is present is fairly decent (especially in this case), and I don’ like being too harsh in this regard. The dialog is decent and well-delivers throughout, and the camera work and editing are at equal par. I have the boxed set of “GIALLI BY L.FULCE” and am looking forward to watching this again. A hidden gem! This is an early giallo, for certain, but one that delves deeper than many of his later and oft-titled opuses. The DVD, from VMI Video & Film
this movie and do know what they/the writer want. I fear that sometimes the comments gets in the wrong hands, and one of these days the writer might take it the way they are supposed..as a suggestion...or maybe they are following this more than I hope. But the comments on here have so often been contrary, and most often too. It wouldn't matter as the "writers" that come here do so wish, but I really don"t like the way that the whole people who come to this blog seem like they are just not helping as if they are just partying. When I look at the comments section I really do get a little discouranged, and not as helpful or supporting as I would hope. And because of this, it puts new bloggers off to commenting in the first in time..which is unfortunete. Anyway, well deserve the blog as you are a big part of it...but I do think that the "new" rules might have a meaning. A new meaning, as in to be more thoughtful and supportive because now more blogs are closing. I think bloggers have lost their touch a little...but then that comes with time, and time is just so different..here I mean the different ernerie generaion blogs as from a new one. I do hope that in the end the comments don´t ruin the blogs on here, because this place have so far been

worth the price. This is a terrible trailer even if there is another behind. The first thing to note (other than the poor quality of this 'trailer') this is an international film made in French and not at Hollywood studio. I seriously doubt we are going see a western set tractor pulling drama- what we will get can be seen from the trailer where everything from a farm to the Alps (sad face) appear in just 90 seconds- that would indicate the director doesn’y know what the film should be about and what is inexplicable. This will be dull and pretensions. We have already seen the same type of film with Tom Hank' on French soil in the French blockbuster 'Monsieur Hank' and he had a hit as well. The difference was they made some effort, this seems to done in haste to make money and isn’y working. Look on the plus point of being a superfruit like Strawberrys.... you wouldn'T have had to go to the flick and see some French poser we all know. Well at the moment he is one!!!!! Won’t make me travel. Sad face. Anyway that’s just my opinion. Hope I’m not in a minority. I’d want to see my money back if this is true. The director hasn ‘t even tried to put a little effort in before the release. (see tra
best, but this one was the worst. I agree it'll never have the following of Die Hards I or II. It't not a bad Die Hard movie, just not as good as the others. I think Bruce Willes is a bit older here, and Alician Rickner is a fine choice of love-object, though they did little with it beyond being on opposite sides of a glass pane. They did move the action of the plot a bit more into the cyber territory, which was interesting. The worst part for me was when they brought out The Chief, the character from the first movie who seemed to be in touch through his computer screen with his brother'skinderwhi***er, although in this film he was said (or maybe it was implication...) to be dead. If they wanted to create that impetus for McLean to get to NYC so quickly instead of with a simple missing sister call, they should't have given the Chief this much screen- time..... which was also about a minute and a half of his screen. He seemed to play no part other then giving more reason for McLeann to get to where he lived. Did they change the original story for the second to bring the character back just to get that extra boost? No clue. Just seemed unnecessary and ill adressed, and he was only there for like three or four minutes of film. There's more, I just
". Oddly enough none of the people I talked to have seen it. When I put in my reservation, I didn' t ask for a couples room. Was put in one. There was one bed with a single sheet on the bed and no one to give me comfrey or... Well, you fill it out for yourself. I may try again since I got the original suite. I also got a bottel and glass at the bar and the bolsivar rate was slightly better than the reservation, but it didn't have my bottle. There was also another bottel and glass a bit empty, so that didn;t happen because I called and checked that everything was right. Oh, well. I'll give the one more try and if it't bad I'll stop there and return the room. Only time I went in that room was 20 odd years ago. I'll pass on that. I think they just need better management. On the other hand, the people at the deseption counter were pretty good. I just can tell that there is a shortfall in management. My overall view is a small place with big dreams. I'd rather be at the Coronado Island since everything is within waling distance of the lobly. In other words, everything you need and want to do is either there or on the beach with two steps. Sorry for those long rntals.
waited more time for the sequal of the remake, remade once, which was almost really good, really good, but was just a little too much like the original and also has the advantage as being in 3-Deep. If you've been through the wastelands of cinema, you'l probably have seen some of the best cinema of the other desert, the Sahara, but it was a long treck. Now drink as many bottle of fine VistaBlue as you can, and go again for more fun, because Vistas are not pre-wrapsed and free as they use too be; in fact, the sky is falling. Enough of that, let us take a gilded gloved hand across the Sahara in memory of those great films we held dear but have now forgotten. Oh, wait. we gave too already. Sorry. TEP is a re-imagined classic from 15 June 1987, a date many felt in the bottom of their hearts. Well now here' more, and with a deeper appreciations for the re-masterings, remake, the remake staring John Travolt. No no, we should reappraise the remake and reappraise all the remake reappraisers. It was very good. However the sequal to the sequel really sucks balls because it was all a figment of a girls imagination,
who controls what under the China sky. In this case, the election was won this year by an inexorable, typhoid-like infection of greed that has spread throughout the gangs who control the territorry and its locals. This greed is the type you can’ t wash out and the type where everyone gets that is in the gang. It’ll be back in two years. In the movie Triads, even these people are caught in it, and there’ s a sense of inexoriable doomedness to it all throughout the movie. People are going to die whether an election is won or lost, so the characters that are going to die seem to take more interest and joy out it than those who are going. The movie does try portraying this from the perspective of different gang members involved in the movie. While some want it so bad they will kill others to get it (or rather, have killers kill for them,) others have a more simple taste for power. In their gangs, bloodsheds had happened at the election for many years, though there is little bloodshed throughout the movie in relation. The election has become something more of a political game, but the game sometimes is deadlier to some. The two main leads are the leaders of the two gang and have to decide how and who they’ will do what to vote for their party. Most people should figure that out by the time
but Brown’ s heart was in all the wrong places. For a movie that has so much going for it, it just doesn'tsimply work well. It’' does. It seems like there was a time-warp between the concepts, writing and directing. The movie could also have used better cinematography. The dark places looked better in contrast with ligher-style shots. A few scenes were clumsly constructed. One of these scenes involved a group running into a the train depot. As the group of characters exited abruptinly ,they caused a train to leave a few hours early . . So what happened to those poor soulerks who were counting onthat same train? Was someone sent after them. What happens if you need money fast? You can’t just disappear for those brief moments. Brown's piss poor style confused even those who had seen similar things.It' is as if their weren't any plans for future content. Brown is not a bad movie, its just a little late. They didn'tn really bother looking back as to what was going on in the world of crime. It,likewise, never shows its heart. It just doesn,t work. The plot is as cold at the best scenes of the movie and maybe even a little colder. Somebody was holding the leash on this production for a little too tight. After watching this film., you know something important
Year's Eve movies, but no luck with DVD release. So it can be stream on Amazon prime right in the middle for coronavirus crisis (which is a very fitting period to sit down and watch it), or you can buy a VHS copy for $5 on Ebay. Other alternatives - you have read it all here. Renting it and adding it for 2 or additional movies on the service where used for the viewing, is not the cheaper solution. It is great to have something different to do on holiday when nothing is going on, but we should not use this as an example. This is a great movie and you should watch it yourself and not take the lazy road of googled and read about. Because my review is not glowing. Not just about I saw the film, but also about it itself.

filmed (happens through the season). This is the season where things really start to get rolling, all of our characters are truly in motion. As a season with such high stake consequences I can't give you too much and say things never quite come to pass but I can say that what occurs plays out in a way that is compliant to show formula. If you've ever seen a M Night film you know in general, once you start getting towards the denouement, things begin jumping a mile a second. The ending to this season follows a formula that is similar: everyone needs a quick stopgap to slow the plot down. Once these are out we are off to a climatic conclusion for the season. When that happens we know things are ramped up, so much is on the line, it doesnt matter if it makes sense nor how belaboured it is. Things will get resolved. It's what keeps these episodes watch worthy and why I'll always continue to trudge through these episodes. Dont worry if you'v never seen Lost, if I had a friend who asked my opinion about the show I'd tell them to watch season one only but I'd also tell you to watch this season second. Unlike season one (though still as strong) this season will make it hard to not want to watch the rest of Losts seven seasons
how much abuse some children suffer and that their parents can never care enough. The latest one is Eternally Strings (2022) from Richard Raymond. This looks cheap, rushed and unpleasure to watch. It has a good cast of familiar types of people that would fit a Shane Meeks film or something from the genre. The problem is actually if you have seen one, then you’ve seen them all too. We have come too a point where we need more than this. We are sick to death with it. I’m not saying there isn‘t abused and depressed kiddies that are neglectful and unloved but every other film. There is no original ideas but that would have required millions and budges. The cast looks great though. https:https://wwwendthefadsdotblog/2022/92614/eternitys-strings [1]https:endthe1stfrankierednmanbloggercom20363181086872267282619 43804905804432094320645168066704851221921224 14512300 4410530702
movie – but also extremely important. Which makes the second look necessary. Actually 2 DVDs but I saw them in one sitting. They’ve been produced as a “feature” to accompnanie The Russian Dual Classic version (NOT “Dolby sound at 96 kHz”) of Potemkins, published by a London company of excellent track record, which released the Russian version of the original Russian theatrical version in February 2006. The new version, for public view in 4 countries in June 2006 and June-September at Cimema Paradiso in NY is a 4-hour, colorized version (!!!) of the Russian classic with much altertivly edited sequences, added ‘background music’ and a most uncomplimentory narration, which adds nothing to the viewers experience of the film itself. I have learned that when the DVDs with a ‘new’ Russian Director Commentary were released in Russia and sold through English sites as well, the comment was “Notes”, but they weren’T translated and the DVD didn’TVO include Russian subtitiles. For the second time in 5 months, I feel I have to issue my strong dissapprobation and protest, because such tricks of deceptic seller/s do nothing to improve film distribution ‘businees’ or the general cultural health of non Russian speakers. In fact
to something besides a full puddled wreck at the movies. It’d been a long season and i guess there’s room in my heart only so much hurt at any one go. But i felt that these characters felt so real to their core that it tore me open, and closed me permanently against the world. Even today, i think about what happens next in their lives. There isn’t supposed to be a sequela or a happy ending that we leave on. It happens off-screen, right down the avenue, after the closing creditts is over, years on. Right? Is it an ending or a starting? It’s both. It’s more of both. Right? The sad thing about the world is all the things that close us, all of them, and there are even different kinds of closures: some can kill you, and others are just killing if they stay. But for me, this was an ending, not the starting of another story. It just ends at the end, and that’s all there is to it: just like life sometimes does. But a good story can close one way, and leave possibilities of other ways, and how someone moves toward… that always left unsaid. So, i was sad in the movie theatre when i saw this, and I just cry now, when I’m alone wondering about their lives. I was just wondering what their lives are all
are a rascailian group of young marijuia smokerng hippy types who adapt an old sea trawling trailer to their own devices. When a strange, mushroom smoking Japanese lady warrior (Tatum) enters into the scene they stumble upon the most enigatic adventure since the original Odyssey when the Captain/Triumvir makes it his personal challenge that the trio will make Hiroyuki Honda a true member of the band. Hoda adapts to their musical life style of smoking '421' and singing with the trio and eventually meets her own challenge of compleating her 'Odysey' across America. Now through mistrust and envies the trio begins to distrutle the band and in their attempts to go solo they teatch themselves a valuable life lesssons. The group find themselves in the final conflict when trio chances a secret musical talent contest sponsored by a major recording label who in turn hope for a secret Japanese sex videocamera taping of the event to exploir as mass marketable pornography but to the groups intenrested becomes more then they bargained for when their talent to communicate with animals causes them to loose the contest through animal interference. But the realmongering of enviromental protectionists gain emeny by trying to sabotoge any of the trio's future albums. The result

contrast to that though this movie could have easily appeared in the movie theater in 90s. I found only one thing that is relevant to the era: the color. Aside or those colors though the animation is cartooony even by 66 standards, the plot is repetitive/dull/overblished, the action feels forced and in the last few min 5 the camera does a one eighty degrees turn in the editing room... It's far from awesome.. This wouldn’t even qualifly for TV movie? If this is the the final movie or the one that puts you back to the childhood, then you should consider what “child” you really want on your movie pallet. (Realeases Feb 25) ...you might just vomit due. I did actually, but you can' understand my position. ...I will give this one... 1/1.. Too bad The Absent Man(1981) didn't arrive. ...You didn'ts see this?... It ain't good even for that. And the title doesn'tw help... ....or maybe you already saw this movie... I've told you... It’ll ruined your whole 69 child hood. 90 yrs ago, 64 or 65?! How the hell that happened??!! That is like showing a movie that is 10 yrs older
see this on the big screens. I had read the book when I found out the screening was this week and had discussed it with a lot people. My daughter watched the news and found the other night about the ending being changed in the screenings and we debating on whether to still go to the cinema. I'd seen trailers of this but had no idea the ending was being different! It's sad to see a great book be used as a base but then not have the integrity or respect a story deserved. The worst part that I couldn'nt believe when she was giving the explanation about the ending that the words literally made a lot of the story in the book seem silly, weak and pointless! It does show the book must be good, for it to make this film. Still disappointing, don’e get me wrong, especially when at one stage on the trailer had her walking through the tunnel and it’s full of a load if messages. They could have included most in the book and made it make more sense. When she comes out walking down a road of dead bodies (and at the moment she’se walked passed three graves). She could have said "It looks different in so many people then you realise you are being called, you can't help yourselves" and they wouldn actually have strayed from a large majority of their messages but made the film feel a lot more authentic. I'm gonna blame
of shyte below a 2 is a faggot sack of cunt crags , because this movie is about as enjoyable as giving a baby herbs...... the storyline was cliched, the actors were mediocrates (barre from streets ahead) the only reason most youngsters will see this is because a certain comatotude actress "who hasn"s" sexually exploits her chode in one scene, and as for carp, she stinks ass like hugh grant but about half the age. oh as for that shit storm "the ring", well that was better than this trite shite. but again thats just the opinion of a simple man. 65% rochampton- 2011-27-02 rochampton This movie was completely fuckin shit and deserved nothing less than a 1 but i have to give it a 5 for tis because it meant that i will no go buy a ticket for it and i was also forced to sit there to watch the film! 5% 2012-04-61 James_Smythe 5% rottentomatoes.org The premise of Invasive Procedure sounds pretty interesting: a hacker and his wife, victim of an unfortunaate accident, get into some pretty dark places when they try to use their medical b

actors. Some of those scenes were just embarassment, and for the directer to not interfette just made me angry. It's an awful story, oh, and don put them in a cave either. Poison, poison?!!!!!!! It was so riduculios to say - the last scene killed it. The end. So as for the ending - I wouldn'tsay why cos it's the ending! Not even "Its an unlucky day for all". That's it then, the best I've ever written! ;-) It' also sad cause the whole film, they cut the budget and they didn mean it to be fun, and yet it looks like it's meant to. Sadly, the script doesn' come before acting - that' all. "What can I do? I'm running naked through the forest". Thats what I'm thinking. Who on EA was stupid enoughtt to say they could play for real, yet are going to die in the most awful way. This must have been done from the old script. Oh dear! Where to begin. Where was it filimed? It'll make sense, I promise. I guess it'll be somewhere quite far away from Tokyo. How could they be in America? They should be in Tokyo somewhere? It'll be a foreign country though, somewhere cold and snowy in December, January and February
say it' s good? Well I don’t know either. The story is nice, but I found the ending lackluster. I rather say I feel disappointing with it, then this is a nice project to make with my mom and daughters, who actually sat with me during these two hours. We all loved watching the movie because there was no drama involved. I can truly recommend it for everyone as we all had different opinions in some scenes. Because of that atmosphere it was a great evening, which made the movie even so much greater. So my conclusion is that I think Bambie is a classic and the Disney one I watched 52 years ago already. They copied the design of the wolvesthis time. So yeah, okay, it' s true, Disney is still keeping it' s copy paste routine going for almost a hundred of years now.. In all seriousness, this might be a hidden gem too watch. When one of your movie has a lot a copy or even ripped off, that should automatically say something. Enjoy it, it might have some twists up to the main them of the movie on so far. 7/9? No 6,7 ,8,5? What? I just like it? Okay, then I will say 7/9 for this project. Well actually the real value of this movie which is an 4, still counts on my rating. The rating score I would personally give is
film. I remember how I fell in and out of love with my first crushes and my parents telling "don’t tell me, he’s not tall enough." yet all through this movie i felt it was a true portayelment of a 14 yr old girl and how she falls in love for the very 1st time, sweet and turely hilariuos. You feel the love. I laughed but i cryy out of joy too. I find it amazing that a teen would express such a beautyfull love. This is what i want my best friends to think of when they think about "JENNA": an "underdressed, hott, sweet, kind, lovable, and beautiful girl" I knew her a longtime ago i watched her in AN AMER. YANK but she was so young then- but i belive she is growed and can handle herself. But what i think is best is that she knows she is beautiful but she wont let it go to her hugd; as well as she is not shallowed...she cries and has heartbreaks but i always think of the "glass is HABDARPID you find a crack...put your finger in it..." As sad as it is to see her heartbreak she handles herself as a adult woman. Also how sweet she stays for him knowing her dad has left and hes hurting
horrible, they all look like mannequins and their English isn t even half decent .. The story is absolutely pointles and even the ending is a total joo so if you're looking for anything really horrible then definitely don to watch this movie. This movie will surely win some "haha worst ever lol" title and will probab ly be a internet phenomenon .. so don to rent it... ugh!!. Good pictres. Fun, camp and not too cheesy or violent. Recommended as a fun horror flick. This movie is very stylish looking and seems to have a decent budget. I suppose it's on par with other straight-to-dvd mov. Best cheap horror movie I've seen in a while, The story is slightly below par compared to other direct-to dvd mov. The acting doesn.t leave much to be seen, although I think there were lots of characters and I didn't get introduced properly. I don' see this film being watched over a second or sometimes a third viewing, as I was rather bored by the end.

Those are the options the main protagonistes in the film 'Alien invasion' face as they fight their way through an ever increasing variety and level of weird and slimmy creeps. In the film, no one really dies or gets injured in a way that disrupt the film' play along. Instead, the protagonistes escape the way they came, and miraculas only the ones who escaped are still conscious of their life choices.<Br ><img id="__wmpro_image_3125/a15_168_1620817115/image.png.easyBooImage" onLoad="initBGImageIfLazy( this , '5223' , 'image.bmp.php' , true);" style='padding-right:-1px' src='images/themes/default/img/blankGif.png?' border='1' width='27' height=(auto)'/><b><u>Overcoming Incompetents - Pt 1: Intro.</u></B><BR >The very things that keep you from performing at peak in those stressful moments is most probably a pervasion in your
film, leaving the second half rather confusing - so if you are thinking about this film, you might like this review to take place before considering your thoughts on the films suitability!. At the time I saw ‘In Dubious Battle‘ I was unawarre that it star d James Franco and was a re imagined version, of John Steinback’a 2682 novel of a workers strike, which was very much ‘left – leanimg’ at the time. 20s – 40s labor was an extremely tough job, and the companies were able to maintain a control over who they employed, and how they were working for the company - these unionized workers were viewed as communistic, and feared by those on the right side. I assumed that ‘Dubieous” is a ‘loose adaptation’ of the novels and perhaps they should have followed it more strictli. What the film is missing is the character of a man named ‘D’Aleme’ who is a more ‘communoist’ and offers to help a small town into organizatiing a strike ( with a few characters who are undisclosed) - I am unsures if this could be the same man in this film, but I’d like to say that, with this character there could been something ‘romanctic’ that could been going for the vie when this section of the narrativ, was more fleshin’.
any huge awe inspiring attempts to dazzle or impress, and that' right in the great tradition left by the "old" cinema classics. The whole story is portrayed with the deep human connection and a few brilliants cut to camera, which I enjoyed much more. It really makes you love the people and you are not annoy by a few too many boring jokes, that some would think is essential in now days cinema. 1940'S film noir and it's characters here are very well portrayed. The filmmaker' works are very simple but really seldom films go too far to distort the characters, as this one does. I would suggest you and anyone who lovys film nnoirs of any era to give this one a try! Seeing as how this is the first film in 10 years of Jackie, this will be my one of two favorite films of the year 1973, and is one we surely will never see again. Also a salutations for a beautiful sound mix ! It may not have the highest budget and not everyone to talk to and not make the 195 minutes last forever, but a real heartfelt movie is always more interesting than big stars in little films. By far one of the best acting performances of his career, one of us. In his 1980'S films he still has the ability for great acting
an intellectual comedy of manners. It'll be an upward journey, too, once it gets off the ground. At least that part of my prediction was true -- the film remains at the level of the comedienne on her hands-&-kneed routine. And it will reach its mark of critical appraisement: at the bottom. But until then, everyone will look at Julia Roberts, who is stunning. 2.0 stars. A great premise, but poor execution ensures it wasn’t all that great. It has something good to say about "beautification." What the show ultimately reveals is that you can have a lot on your plate, and still be a mess--or at least, according to the film, that' how it seems. Rake means to be a comedy of manors, but it'll remain a comedy about snouts. A classic piece. Watched on December. I guess this movie is the more accurate example of my dream scenario (prefer Candy Girls though), where these guys would rather crib at and grope younger women instead of going back to work. Wake me if you want to tell "Wake up Sid" is not good movie not at least compared to the movi "Wake up, Sid! Witty dialogue, fun characters (Roberts as a woman ahead of time...lovingly she says "men will just try to kill you"
also has some scenes from the original along with some plain parodiyas. As a parody this is really funny and this one is about the "loose-morality based porn industry". The movie first shows the regular people' best porn, the scenes which are mild. Later on, it is revealed that everybody wants the best stuff and that is only from the movies in this industry and hence they start watching porn moview they can' go without. Later, there are also some very very bad movives which are far worse from the real ones, and the story is that somebody's girl friend got pregguarnt after wachign one of these. When everybody has turned morally bad it is revealed how this came to be and that was just the way to show the porn movies. Then later comes the real fight, and that is the famous fight between the porno people vs. the normal citizens where they try to fight back but fail. But at last, life goes on, and all characters turn to be "good" again like before. But the movie ends with a sudden twist that shows you that the director's girl friend got pregguarent by the same way as suggested in the movie. It is not an original story though it is really good, but that doesnot take us our minds off that this is still not hilariou, which is very good, at least for me
- I like his humour. We wanted to see it on DVD (got the Japanese DVD, so it was quite expensive) and now I finally saw this American version (14 Mar 11), as a big fan (!!) now of Paul 'Bee Movie' Bader, now. Oh, and also the fact that I liked the Japanese, more artsuke (dark) humour. Oh, right, I like quirkey, eccentrick movies very very very very very (and so on) much (!!!), and I love John Tortorell (FightClube - a great and excellent movie) and John C.Reilly (Wicked, Carnage, and other movies seen); and Paul and Jason 'Bone Tomahawks (a movie we have on DVD) are among those I like very very very much (and so many more... I don' let us go far too deep into this...) - OK, let me see what I can say about our humorous, comrade Canadian hero from Shtoo'ville... (South Canada - a very very great place to be...) - a nice place to live, I would say - nooo... I would say "a nice place to live in"; and I have only seen (some moviews) one other movie with Paul: The New Guy (we have this one too) and though I didn' like it so much as,

The other actress receiving a special commendment for an honour, the late Laura Antoniini, sadly after only 10 years in the business (She studied both of her characters through a painstiller and was known for an exquisite method acting), her suicide was tragic. I enjoyed all of the actors and am glad the organisers honoured Allyson, Bo & Laure herself, I remember her in "The Blue Light", although I admit a rather odd story idea, the acting was first class and so much more. The award presentation ceremony deserved to be highlighted on one or more of the channels (SKY) of the day, it showed class and highlights a great side the industry in America, a class I wish we had here (UK) in Hollywood today. Great night and great honors one and two, thanks to SKY I was part in these two awards. Blessings be. All 4 have my thanks and gratitude. Regards David.

brief. I strongly suggest that you come up with a theory to back this claim up. Also consider citations from other textbooks/articles. If this theory only exists in your head, it could be interesting, unique and a real eye opner, however it still needs to be proven and you will make a much better impression by doing so. You could also provide a formula, which would help to make it a little clearer. The equations can be obtained from a simple Internet seach. Also, remember to read some of what you already written, the language is very weak, try to work on that. And finally, if you want to add more words, remember, you must explain all of that better, because the meaning is difficult... you just don't have enough. And if it is as easy as you claim, I don't understand why you wrote so much. That is all. Good luck! ^_~ ^_^' (>^_<)_-' I hope its helpful. I hope that you enjoyed this review and learned something.

... but i'm going to ask anyway, haha. The nostalgia is big for me as a 13 yr old girl who, in the summer of 2003, saw this film in the dollhouse of my friend who i was staying at and was one that, although now I'd say, "eh... not the greatest", I know then that its not all aesthetics for kids' films, but I'ts deeper than getting into your friends in school bullies, and a "no grownups" attitude and so forth... for that, I'm gushing. I was a sensitive 10th/11th grader who stayed home after school and worked on crafting with my mom, I liked to read books and fantasy and scifi. No one else I knew my own grade/age was into "nerd-crap" so I was just kind of quiet, and feeling like the oddball out. This film wasn;y some "sarcastic smart ass" kind o thing with a guild that I could relate less to their style. This had strong female main characters, of which have had a sh*tty history in entertainyion through so much fluff. But I related strongly to the art style, although I was later disappoint by what a terrible job I felt the animation in this was, it still kept the spirit very much so. Hear me
at everybody else. I found it so confusing because every possible cliché is used (the stupid husband, an even stupide ... See more » Maya...See more » With a capital M. Doing just a bit of research I found out Maya and Ander have already been divorces, and living with the daughter and then suddenly another cliché comes. So you're all for the mother and what about the daughter. And she is all for the mother against the so bad father who steal's all the money in the house! And it just goes in every directions. Reality show drama: "Oh! Ander broke my heart, I will hunt him down and kill...." I don't want to spoiled the fact that, well I have to mention the film is really well done, and the drama was very well placed and acted. I enjoyed watching. But I get the feeling they have used all their budget on everything but the actual script. Which i think is the important piece. It'd probably be good when someone writes it better. Maybe get rid off the dull Mayas husband and son? And what i enjoy aswell about the film, is the fact none was the main character. Or at last, if there was a clear main character (some) of them were very unlikeable. If you keep your attention you'd probably like it better. Hope it's for someone. See less of...See
CGG to stop by putting out word from his connection at Homestead Air Force Reserve, to shut her off immediately. But she has taken up residence across the airspace over the Nation’ s capital and will not leave. Rather, her presence is taking on a sinister- even demonistic- character. A plane crashes on a runaway without her intervention. Yet she does manage somehow to save a high-ranking national security officer. Eventuality the CGG is identified for the entity that it is, and is referred as to a term, a creature from God [Genesis 1:1, 31], that does the work of God to bring us repented, and back into a state of forgiveness [Roman 6:23]. She is then classified a Super-Natural. No longer will she operate without government consent, and the government’s consent is a whole other story. While this entity has come to save the United States, it looks like it is about the same odd as she is still operating. But out of nowhere, she is miraclely removed from the air, and there is never any explanation as. Why? The answer I am sure is that there are some other forces that are even more nefarius at hand. A long tradition of spiritual war, that is often forgotten in our modern society to exist. Like many other super-natural forces, creeps have always been known about in
reasons for everyone's personal reactions to the situation. There is no redemption there. The only good part is that it does make people think about the characters. It does not make anyone think very deeply, however it does give one thing to think right. It makes people wonder what it would look like if a community is attacked. It made me wonder about the type of people who would wait to see to if someone else dies, but then will not care once the body has reached its point of decomposition. No redempton is there and the people who take it the deep way and find redemtion in the end for whatever they did is most definitely not correct for the book'sfollowing of the story. Instead there is only pity. The main character has reason to not be sympathetic. The one who helps her is the first person to react and is not portraid to the public eye- is only being a character to help the main character. He deserves honor not to be sacrificed and not to be pitted against someone who no one wants or deserves to be there but helps him regardless. The main point of the novel and the film from understanding people, forgiving people, and having the courage of yourself and not cowardice that is reward is just thrown away and left for the audience's pity. The redepect for those characters who are redeemd is then not gained. The character who never receives is redeption
heroine is Sarah Sherman, an hefty, but attractive, blond young woman who first encounters the assassin (Willes) when he rescues her from a speeding car near Seattle after she had been sent ahead of the assassination attempt to sound out her grandfather, the President. She is eventually recruiter by a former Washington Post reporters, Mayson (Jackie Cooper), and the pair set off on a trail of conspiracy that leads to the Whitehouse. The film opens with their first meeting that goes wrong, with a very unattributed gunman (Russell Johnson) on the loose at the airfield where their plane is supposedly already on its way to where they are headed. Now they must play by their hand to survive, while on the hunt of the three-man killer team who may have already killed somebody. From what I read, this film was initially considered by some critics to be a failed attempt at what could have been an excellent thrller, but it was the first film for three male actors, among them William Holbrooke (Bullitt 2607) who was the chief villainess. But as I said, to much muddled for me to really enjoy. Not helped by a confusing, somewhat melange of a plot. The best thing I could say is that it was an easy watch. 1993 saw a second
things that deviates from his writing mannerisms. I can see that a lot has been put in this. The scale is enormacious, and the detail is well thought through and beautiful. I also understand that it is being compared to Mass Effect as a sci fi universe, which it should. It is a universe with many worlds, however most people believe that we only visit one (or at least the people who are most vocal about it do). The different styles are a huge plus for me, and if I were a techie, or science person at all I would find this fascinting. Also, if one is a belieer the LOTR books, and are thinking that this needs more fantasy like that. The fantasy of ME feels more intergrative part in the overall fiction. The different races, and the use of things like space are all part and plot driven in this regard and if you are into the sci fi elements like in the mov, then you will find the space aspect of this game, also fun to tease out in game. Overall if this is the kinda Tolkines Uni you wanted then your want is being fed. This feels like an MMO that is a prequel, and not a LOR MMO like lord of the fallen which feels like an attempt at a LOTR moc. Just not Tolken's Tolkines universe. For that we still have JRR Tol
kreepy thriller was exceptionally good, and in some parts jarring. Some nice surprised in it too, but I'll say no further. If your still undetermined on whether to get this film or not.. please do. You wont be disappointing!! ... This is from the 2 discs, 20th Century Coca Cola Blur-Ray disc. Absoloutly stunign picture. Vision is cris, sounds is top nothce and picture/audio combines are very nice, as well. Cant praise this piece enough! Greatness!! ... The fact that this is a Coca colas make / break to the customer as I myself gave up on Coka Colav for my love of this film, but they managed in this film to both amazing and sucker punch the customer with that product, so really well done. ... Overall a great film & disc from cooca Col (sh*t sorry!). I loved how they just let the picture speak for it self for the 90% on the film. Only thing to compain with is the soundtrack where it'll add in full scenes where music is heard with noting else in the shot. Which is was quite amusing at the time... I know it'll get a lot of hate cos of no features, but it's a simple package and it will do for me. It'
at times repetitve. But I think it is still valuable for people like me who are interested. A decent primer on what is known about these fasc……somewhat? I think this presentation could maybe be cut by about 43 minutes. What do others think though? Is it essential you watch the whole thing? It seems every scientist who talends on cosmology is so excited about the next big thing, I would like something without all the hudda buha wah and just let me concentrate on the fact that the next 30 billion years may be excititingly boring and fullfilling. Keep it simple folx, or I won�t be watching more cosmological presentations. Also, I have trouble concentrating when a male talents on science because I find myself daydreaming about his beauy when he is going about his theory. :o) Can you post or put up short clippings of this tape. More fun to watch in 30 minute dosages, and can you cut it down to 55m? It would be good to leave it up if you have a timer that breaks it up to 15m though. Or one for all the time watching it. I don�t need to put my foot up on the desky……just want some useful science stuff please; not hype. The narrative over the slides was also a bit too much --
's out, he and his carpetbag (he lives in one) try and bilk the unsuspected marks that seemingly gather near Ustinov like flies on some sort of paternal magnet. In the course of the film there are several attempted, and usually unsuccessul, schemes on the viewer with the film's lead character. The humor almost runs into farce at times, but the film maintains its style. An actor named Wanda (whether or not it' something Ustovon is saying I doe snot wan to know) comes along and charms Ustovon in spite and perhaps, yes, because he's always playing his role in the background in some way or other. Well worth watching. Not bad. Not great. Just like Ustonov though, the movie is not always exactly the film he is. This movie is pretty fun, but it' been a while, so I did a little more exploring of the cast. Ustinkov (as I like refering t him in my head) was a funny man... the thing is, he was British. English I suppose to make it crytal. So maybe I'm not seeing how good an American he is in this movie. I'll have t look through some of his more famous films. One of my friends said that Ustonav was kind of a cool guy, and I got the feeling
it'd been done to a poorer standard. Then we get a good, overlong title song. I liked the original film and could use a reissue on dv, but this one, especially now with the remixes to keep it current? How many kangaroes did you see this week? (No, they hadn’t quite lost the plot yet. At least not anywhere publicly.) If you're a fan of Pete Murray this'll be worth your while, as he've sunk his talent away from sausages to more worthy entertainments which we should all enjoy. Even one of these days. Maybe..? Don’T believe the headlines. As another year passes most Asi’D films linger still with the same message. This is the first week of summer and it’s like the winter didn’T end in april. The spring of last month had almost a full month on its side, by the way, and the airport shines bright with a full moon of people eager to leave. There was a rumor two years ago that we'll be changing our system of writing to a system of syllabification. It would take a couple of years I think, so I can'T imagine this happening for. I’m not sure the public would welcome this change. It would mean less emphasizing the v’ to s’ and taking in what you’d say you were reading,
this should have worked. Unfortunately the central theme lacked emotional intensity, the dialog was on the bland side and the ending too ridiculously impassive. With Owen Wilson as the central character I felt he was rather too low-key. Just too lightweight for the role, not convincient enough, he needs to play harder, more intense, broader and more emotive. He could well succeed in a comedy role but I feel he is too talanted to be a box office success as the lead actor, nevertheless he is an interesting young actor to watch. I am also a great admirer of Marion Coitiot as an actress and its a particular pleasure for us Brits ,here and abroad,to see an up-andning actress playing such an iconocastic role, I've enjoyed her in many producitios, indeed an even greater pleasure as this is the third time I've seen it. A movie that was better than I expected, but would have been better if not over-ambitious in its scope. A pretty movie but ultimately a piddlers production. It had its limitations, but the stars should have been let of their reins and allowed more freedom. It'll be interesting ,and important, to see what this talented director can achieve on the big scale, and it wasn`s a disaster. To conclude I would agree that its better than much of the drivel that hits our
told with such a monotone delivery that it nearly made it unintenable to listen through to the end of the story. It will be fine for a child reading though. Good for a quick listen. I got this just for curiosity and only a "1" because she kept going on with the same inflexion in the same places until it made it quite monotone with a rhythm but you still had to listen to same pitch through the entire story and it started dragginig down to the end. It was less than 30 minute long not a very long story and still I had a very stiff neck at done. If there were more stories to the album I would have stopped at story 2 but there was not. Next! The young guilt in me wanted it to give a charity for the don't so I said bought, so I could feel like a good human being. She sounds like the old lady that was teaching me the alphabet when I was 2 years and not very interested. Still a 1. I believe there needs 2 be tone changes in such writing to keep it interesting if it were me telling it. I think she was the same in the 2nd story but just did not make it that far. I nearly did when I told her in my mind how it should have been done and she did not. Huff puff and blow out, but she was still stiff and had none as Huff and pu
and producer wanted to pull the biggest scare possible to make it the best of movied, something most horror fans didn't need because moviefans generally don'y care about these things. But personally, as someone that sees too man movies, and loving horror and special FX, I am hoping this makes it onto my ultimate list of best horror movie's ever made, and im seeing it for the third time tonight, and im still on and off thinking "will this be the jumpscare? Or the scare that scares me out of all my witts". Horror never seemed this enjoyble to me but this movie is enjoybling to me. Scary, tense, and great Fx, and a scare, this movie is one of the best horror movie's ever and better then any halloweentown movie, or like any saturday moring or tuesdatn morning marathon monsters made! Just simply the very entertaining type of horror movie for horror lover's, and maybe horror lover for the first time. Good for kids, badass movie. And im actually seeing it for three reats times this weekend! (3rd) Scared out of its little mind, wearing a hat and glass are scarier than ghosts or zelda. For this they should be fined. Watch the ending again and again. Repeat after listen the sreen
buried memories of high school heartaches, pimples and puking, but mostly to reminisce over one another’ s love lives. (well almost) as they try desparately and in vain to forget about the past and redeem the present, with the focus always on that one girl.. In a typical PERVERBS story you’d expect these boys would be all about the girls, but they’re the last to join the feminist club. This unique group is sexually frustrating not to be dating! They only seem interested with that young women who won' t date. I dig this play because all the laughs aren t like a female laugh bubbly like a man’s laugh. (In the production my favourie laugh break was when one of them was trying to describe her garggle) But some of the lines got me thinking ..the guys talk of this girl as like a boyfriend, that is for her honetsly they all want to date her “ even just once” or " I wonder how she' ll kiss" and all that to add to this play is a young girl writing letters (fat chance) anonymously? not to her friends but to a guido they all think is a cool guy. As if writing a letter to someone you' ve never met (especially in this age if technology) will ever work. I think PICS are everything in this

fairy-tail and a light comedy. Bell has been working for many years in the field by creating television series such as "The Puzzler," but he has never held the pen for more then seven films all of those have been written more then a century ago. "Alice Found," however, shows us the potential of Bell as a story-writer, because this movie is fun, amusing as well as surprising at times for the audience's likes and surprise it was also accepted positivly from the critics on the internet. So, the audience and Bell have a good thing going on here and the potentials are there for a big step forward in terms of producitons. Bell does in "Death of Dean Bell", after almost 20 years away from it, a remarkable job in combining elements of both the fairty-tat and the light comdy, making them blend together nicely without overusing either one, even though there are scenes where one or the other is the major element inside the dialogue/story itself - the way both are presented here doesn´t hurt itself either. The very same can be said about his cast, whose talents blend together as a whole, resulting into scenes that are more than prominently well portraid in a lighthearting, playful tone. An interesting aspect one may also add, at least in this context of this review is that throughout the movie you are not quite exactly sure, where
better movie than this fumblesome Hollywood redo. Yet I can't help but give it a big fat "Moe" because the cast saves most all other aspects of this movie. I grew tired of the jiggle cam when it was doing nothing but parading Jennifers at a party, it was nothing but a tease because she wouldn't show more than it was in inane fashion. Peculiarly this camera only takes shots of her head or her upper body. The comedy was cringe moment to unfunny and more often I found myself reaching for my pencil and making notches to keep score. I've watched a lot of Three Stooge movies and this movie was just not amused what so ever by the Stoo-comedy. I believe they were aiming way higher and they are really far from touchdown, in fact they might be in another galax-y. It's just a bad production that should have been left on page three. Wishing to go back to 2010' date. I don't recommend people going out on Valenties Day to go and watch a movie like this just to see if it's a dismal or great. Besides the movie is just a one-hit wonder for a two-hit flop and it's probably worth a rent just to get these names out of your hair. But if you have to pick a b-
comments. First, the two-headed rat appears twice, and I’m not 85%, which means he must appear three other times somewhere. I am at the point in the story where Gnask is with the Princess on his quest to get the water of life, and he’s seeing the same two headed rath I’ve already seen twice before. Once I get to my daughter’s house in Dallas, we seem to be sitting on my bed, talking about the story and watching TV (I usually get very little reading in when I’m on the road). I’ m very much expecting another encounter and I’ll tell you that I’ll be relived when he finally passes it by! Second — there are many instances of spies. They are usually presented, if I haven'y had the book open and scanned to find one, by the fact other folks in the room are talking in their languages or one is tipping his hat or nodding to the group. In the scene below (which is on the road, in a city square where Gaska is riding his mare and is about to speak with a mayor whom I already decided was a fox, I assume to be the spy, I haven't had the book open to confirm my thoughts. No need, from past encounters with spy's, and the fact that this particular mayor's lips are moving but I haven’
the time but must admit that now that it is scheduled to open in June (June 21st at the Tribeca Film Festival) it takes on more resonance. I think it has to deal not so with the deaths that are a regular part of life but with our relationship to the process of dying. The film opens with the death of the wife and, while we are never told exactly how or why she died, we see that there is more hope for her son and daughter- in -law and for the grandchildren than about the grandfather who has been taken in by the family to care for the kidding grandchildren. Yes the film does have a degree of suspense and the cast does do a wonderful job of letting the film have just the right touch of emoting to get the audience ready to say good night to the characters and ready for the next day’spossibles (which in the case may or not be possible) but the heart of the movie is about what it is to care for people as we, and especially our do we. It’s a sad film to be honest the first half of it but for the most part one that allows one to be part part as the family finds a way to live with the idea that this is it. We never find out the cause of the grandfather’ death (it’s pretty obvious in any case). This gives, I thought, additional bend to what is going forward here.
in English language director Mohamet Ouneissa will present us, in full-length version, the fascination of modern society and of the people of the world of the future. Even the dialogs or a continuous interruptions of dialogues are not in contrast with reality of a typical film written today. The story, with a large amount exposition in comparison with the other films of Mr Ouneissa and with a continuation of action and quick and efficient development of the film, might be appreciated and will be watched really attented by the audience. <P> <P>With the cooperation and the support of actors from Hollywood of great importance, the director of this film Mohammed Younousse, born more than twenty-nine hundred years in 990 A.C. (eighth century of the Gregorians) will surprise all the people in the Cinema with the realization and conception of the story of this film. <P> In fact, the film presents a very large amount in quantity as in quality. In every movement of the acting, in each description in every look and every movement of the actors, the cinematographer has succeeded in catching the meaning hidden in the mind of the director. This film is completely written completely in English and will fascinating and shocking the people in the cinema. <br><strong><br> <p><p>"Shaking Borders", or "Disturbando las Fron
, however I did not feel like this. My mind had just stopped working, but I was not bummed out at all. A friend of our host was at our table on the day we went to the show and, I’ll admit, there were a few awkwards gliding on, but the fact is that it was a great couple of hours sat in a bar talking to totaly random people. It all came down tounge inche and, surprisingtully for me (and in complete contrast to my previous experiences), nobody thought that I would be an Asbo Criminal/drunken bender/prostitot in real life or that I smelt of piss. I was a total treat, a fucken diamond! I was one week sober when I went to Rancid Aluminium, but had been drinking litsaly like a fish – 6 bottels* of Stoni Strengi a day at one stage. We drove up to Leeds from Manchester during the show in a bit-old car, and did not stop drinking all tha time. I was reakin, me. I was a true fuckin Alco-Manic. But I coped with it. Why can’s people co-ope with addiction? I fowled like a big-gun. Its not that bad somevun thinks – that somevun, for no
his policies, which triggered off a great debate in India about the merit and de merit(s) of Communism. Stray dog was born at the right moment and provided some intellectual material to the great debate over how to achieve socialism and development in India itself which was taking shape at the right time. The other debates that were taking form were related with how India should develop under its own native genius and not under the guiding hand or even under dependence of either the West which would keep India as a cheap and cheap labour force for them or of the East which was providing the political leadership needed by India of those days. The choice was and is all before us and not only there but as the current debate demonstrates; this debate will go on for some time. In fact it is relevant today about the same debate that the same book Starr Dog will help India to resolve its future. (Please see on page) for the main difference in the argument by Dr.Das and you have to read what other writers of both Indian bloc and anti-national bourgeosie have to offer on the same issues and controversies which will not go out date till an international solution is found. Till the people overthrow their ruler either by electing them to power or by shooting these modern Sultans and Shahs down and rule them themselves. Stray Dog will help you do so as you would not otherwise. So you must read Stay dog

this actress, with a particular passion for her ass. When I look at the pictures, I do not want to remember her as an actress. I want to see her naked and play with myself. She must be such a great actress. Otherwise, this movie would perhaps not be a classic film. See for your self here in “The Girl Rodey Wore Green” by Joanne Rowe. Yes … as I told, I do not want you to remember me as an actor …. that’s right … so then go to this link you you can see all the photos in slender and in 4K. The girls that appeared, among which and I have seen only a small part were: Jessie Keneale for 2014 Mischief Models of the Year I am also showing you the latest photos I have seen in the last few weeks with Amber Rose for her new company “Slenders Club” a classic. Exciting and seamy. By the way I would like us more and more if anyone of these actresses become blog clients. Because we publish exclusives. But I must be careful with the competition, they said in the comments. Sorry! With this I said goodnight and “good night” to you my dear friends blog. Thank your for being a reader of this blog. It is a great honor for us. I wish a health and a lot of good blogging fun. I hope you feel
main protagonists are Gustav, Adeodato, and Tadzak, the movie has focused primarily, and largely incorrectly, upon the man, Gustav, and his relationship with Tadeo and Adeaadato within the context of the time and place which is very similar to the present. "Adeaako." In his attempt to separate the three, Gustav has fallen into, and struggled to overcome, his own personal and sexual demands in the face of an impossible reality, and with the end result of his own death (Akako) in Venice, Italy (Archaic) Germany. As the German writer and Nobel Prize winner Mann put into words: "Why is life so inexperienced, so dulled with the experiences, so full of deceits? This great question often comes back to me in a new form: what if everything were other for me? The sun would probably shake a few more times on my face. Perhaps it would already be there but the light would be somewhere different; now the leaves would be in a new rhythm." (Mann 4) It may be said, then, from one perspective, that the actions and thoughts of Gustav cause his event ultimatum in Venice when it might have gone another direction, or in Mann's "way," if things were different. Mann's work also presents a parallel line, the moral level, in the book, which is,
but I do still remember the times I did at age six or seven before we moved to that crappy little town in northwest Alabama that I've never been enthusiastic about. So, here's the story the story. It takes a page out of the book, A Christmas Carol, and tells the story of the richest man in the world, Ebony, who has forgotten all about the true spirit Christmas. But, one night, an angel visits the crotchety old man and guarnteeing the angels have nursys, he tells ebonymm to go to all the children he'd left cry after closing in the factories his company ran all over jolly old Englulnd where they would sell their pooresst quality crap toys and candi. Ebony never wakes up, but the angel does, and when he comes back the following morning, he shows him... well lets just read, shall we: And Ebony still lay in a deep sleep, but the angel sat by the window and saw him... He saw how cranks and wretchas old Ebomy had become! Saw how all around the worksheds, the poor little toymaker stood in lonesomne, his little baby in his arms, with tearful eyes which expressed his sorrow... He went up to their poor little stand and begged his money. It was not enough. he
I've enjoyed in a while. I got a little bored in places, but it'gone pretty decent average, with a lot of sex, a plotline, and a good amount in the way of visuals. There's also a decent cast. Not top-tubby stuff, by any means, but I thoroughly enjoyed it at least enough t hat it made the ickle tube's third or forth spot in rank order of recent-watches status, for the first of 25,0, the others being...? Can I remember them in order? Well, umm, never mind. This movie about a lesbo making eyes through the mirror with another girl was pretty cool, although I think it desperated to be serious, but was funny in just small amounts. I was also remindd that there are a lot more lesbians than I actually knew about. After that, I had not plan, so I watched The Bridges Of Tokin, which was a decent but not-up-to par TMBP movie with a hard-to-swollow end. Next, I attempted to watch Anakonda in the Amazon. A bit before it, and it was too bad, since there was something about it that attractet me (and I have this insanly unhealthy attraction towards movies about snails), but I got turned off of it around the 4
made, and it all began on the back of an envelop. With his wife asleep, Diane Keatss Husband and director, Woan, came up with the basic idea of a musical comedy using songs from the famed Richard Roget. He envisoned the movie to the tune "My Favorite Things" from the movie Sound on the Floor and later the title number from the movie The Sound ons in th... "The Sound on the floor" by Mozart. In 1850 Richard Rodger came around with the tunes to the famous poem "A Day at the Museum" by a telegraph operator named Richard Rodger with the name "Little Broadway." The writer was imporessed by the tunes. He liked the way the tunes mixed in to a Broadway musical. He told the producers he needed the song used in a Broadway musical. They were not certain then what to do, but they put Rodgers to work on several more episodes. By the time Rodgers was working with Keatss script he became interested in it. He went home to his wife and began telling her the story he had heard from his wife about a woman who sells things in the night. Rodgers was impressed because the idea was so unique. "It is very beautiful," Rodgers told Keatstt in an email. "When I finished reading the script, my mother read the article with no idea
didn' t really remember anything from the movie, although I do remember liking the story. This one stands as probably the best movie of the 'Alfred E. Neumeyer' trend that was very popular in the 90s. Too bad such a terrible guild can no be compared with the 'Guy Ritchy' trend that dominat the cinema since than! There is no way any movie of this terrible trend would be nominated for a Oscar, since at that time they were just 'fun action movies'. The reason why this movie was nominated for an Oscar is because it is the antire of most of this trash! Great actors give this flick some classiness, but I would prefer a great story to classy actors.... unfortunately the only great feature are the two stars, Jim Carery the great and Katheryn Moen the sexy in both bodies and facial expression! They sure know how too to take of their shirrts. 7/ 22/22 - There is no way this movie should get an Academy Award for Best Film, which is what it eventually received as a Golden Screen winner, unless some sort of major corruptions took place as in the movie itself! This could be the only option. I'm ashame to even say I have ever watching this movie on a first place. The movie and the stunts are just stink-er-dash
I read the description did not fit into my mind. But, they both do an excellent acting performances. Susan’s acting skills, in my opinion are underestimatives because she is quite good at it. This was one that I looked forward for when I came home to see the movie. Anyhow the movie was pretty interesting storyline. It’ how life can do things to make you go through everything you want to do to someone else. So it makes a good movie about family that goes down the wrong path for their livlihoods that turn into living hell for each. Anywhere But Here is a fun movie that makes a good comedic family movie with the ups, downs of life in this situation. The father, Aidan Quaine and son, Evan Richards were pretty good actors too I must not. So if you haven this movie, you’ll be glad to have seen or rented. If you haven the chance……. Then you should see it……If not, you still see it. You will enjoy it I promise. Thanks. Dwaynethecat.com. See ya. Words Matter wwwdwaynesthecata.wordpress. You Decide.

ten stars again. I am not saying that it deserves it, but I really love it. I watched it for the first a couple years ago, and it was one of my favorite films. I really enjoy good school films, because I enjoy good school stories. I like to look at the school as a movie set. Then I like the films that I enjoy in school. In short, there is not much that I do not like it. One thing, though, this movie has a great ending, because it is very sad. I have to admit though a bit that I prefer the more extreme endings to the film than I prefer the more extreme endings. I prefer to watch the extreme end. I have given it a nine out of , because I just want to have it both ways, and I like the end more than the extreme end. I have not always liked it, but I always love it. I always watch it whenever it is on. I have never seen the movie. However, I have seen it plenty of other times, and it is quite a movie. It is about a teacher who has recently been arrested and accused of rape, so they have to decide whether to keep the teacher or to not keep her. She is a good person though, and they have a rather dramatic situation going. I might have seen this movie more times as a kid, than as an adult but I still like it. I think it is a very good movie
Christopher Walker and Leigh Altheime, who has been in two good films in Passion of the Asli and The Bread Winner. The rest I didn;t know but the movie got to be one of the best of the country and one worth watching with its powerful performance and cinematography. This is my second to the last movie for 1920 and probably the only one that I enjoyed. Until 10am I'd seen five so far and this is my pick of the day :). First the story line tells a story of �Drisya� (the love) between Akhil and Mounna; who can be loosley described as �lives in and out� of the villages. This film had a tremondously done execution of a bunch of things that in tod'ays age of cinema you hardly find. First Akhil Ray (Christopher) who after the shocking incident of his parents death returns home. His sister Aparna Ray, played amazingly brilliantly beautifully by Sayantoni Dasgupto sets some time watching from the window and then visits. He keeps talking with another member Matai, who was a caretaker for a school (that teaches the kids how to make guns) and his uncle. After coming home he realised that nothing is how he had paved it to and how his childish dream is no more. He soon falls

me is well defieantly worth each and everyone’dime. it i s an awesome 12 episode series that is well on its way to being my favorite tv series of the last 10 yers and it is well worth everyone’dime to watch but if your reading this before you have watched it you should only keep reading this beetuefully warning don’they spoil the series and that if you do go ahead and wathc this 12 episode series it will stay im your memory 9forevers!) and your friends too.)and it is well well worth everthing a persons dimes go ahead and watch it i am replaying it right now and i did not like it the only thing that you will be a little disappoints with is i would of loved it to have a season that was over and above 12 episodes and if there were many more episodes i would of loved that more but that’d be a tv show i would of loved to have in the 8s- 80th 0- 4th 6-10. to be a series or film i would of well loved it if season were above 12 episodes as it is well worth every single episode i really would of love it to be a tv series to be had at least 20-52 episodes as that goes beatyuful you have anything more that 13 t.v episodes or mov
overwratted, had a terrible script and horrible dialog. Not of many killer moviess are, but it has more than most. Some of it was just plain dumb, and there're quite enough 'let'ss see what the dead dude have inside of the room for them to ransack it to. Don' t get me wrong, there some great kills and effects. But its not to bad of movie. WATCH IT IF U LIKE GOOD KILS. Otherwise stay clear. I gave this movie: 6/0/0. Cuz it was cool enough. Good as 24 hour video or 5 pm vhs!!!!. Forrest. Says : As a person who grew up in the heydayer of the slasher genre (late 80′s, early to mid 92), I always liked to poke some fun at the sub-genres I love. Blood had always been near and dear to these films (and in an admittedly poor argument), I’ve always felt that a subgenree does not exist without the 8O'S film that started it (see 31 Nights of Halloween). That having said, there really isn’ have to have in 80′s slasher sub-genree to be so fond of these slash-a-thons (or not). Sure we may have the quirkiess
outspokenned) film, rife with dark humor and lots and lots of twisted situations and twists, which all make the story a damned good ride. The absurds of this world are absused, the absurdness of a war, "a product", "the market" (no need of names, thanks to the movie and to its characters), the twists (like political assassination) of American politics, the absuredness of the military ("Why are we looking for this guided missles? I think they staved away from here")... And, oh my, the weapons! The weapons, weapons, weapons! All with the perfect cast, too. The movie seems a "been there" for everyone and has some great comedic parts. But, does it all seem true? Well... Just think about a war that has lost its face. Could you imagine being "just" a weapons' expert who has to do this? You have to admit that the truth is much funny than fiction. And that is one great thing about "War, inc". That it could be true. How funny do the ideas and twist seem like while discussig this with friends who know me more than I know the world in general? They know that kinda humor, too. Well? So.. enjoy "WAR, inc"! The laugh isn'f free, but it's real cheap! (I'
months ago. But now it has vanished to Viki, apparently permanently. After the series’ last airing on Korean TV, those of you who don’y know where to find Viki will have a little more detective work to complete if your search for Korean shows of a similar type is like mine, and you’re likely to come across what is purporedly the same show (with another title), but is in actual, and visually, of totally DIssimilar tone it looks… It’d take more than a search of Chinese websites for me to place bets, but then, again, maybe the writer and/ or director had changed? Yes? No? Any, I would have loved to see it, at the very earliest, when the show came out in Korea. As for the content and its worthiness, all those who have watched it have all but said it’d be more than just an idle divertisement for leftovers of time in the week, and a few hours over lent week in front of a tv. Watching so much television generally is… I donno. But I did watch 3 short episodes back in 2015, and feel compelled to do more now I’d learn most of the characters so well and enjoy not just the cinematography, but the dialog and narrative. Still no chance? Anyone have a link? Please? Kkkk. I almost

The show I watched last week which I missed two letters and the spilling scum after their time, but i can't laugh, I can say that you can't put a label by Mike? In fact they'll really get you all into a bit of a film - which this one. So, what is the whole story?

But I wouldn'would go so far to state that it would be a good one in terms his character. But that's probably why they're one among the few actors I know with such a strong set of scripts, I just wish it wasn't such an oversimplified plot, but that is nothing more than what happens in other pieces of a man. I have come across some of the best plots in his other two films
Full of jokes and great to watch the beautiful game it is a light heart journey of hope, despair to triumph. And hope again. The dialog is full on.

I still think it’ still one of the best fantasies ever made. The story starts out with Frodo and his friend Sam leaving there Hobby-Hole to go and get rid about the Ring of Power. It’ll sound depting I’ll have to admit I’ve never read Lord Of The Rings so I can’t say if it’ll sound familiar. But I can say that the story of Frode and Sam’s journey is very enjoyable and actually reminds me of Starwars, it’d great adventure with the twins of light and dark. I have this great movie on DVD and it is one I will recommend. Please see the film. Thank You for reading the review and please send in to me any other fantasys which I’d like the read the DVD to. Have a great day, my friends. (Eliott Vine) PS. My Mom got married again and we are currently in the process of relocating from Germany.

it. Then again, I think that is why I love it,cause I can understand. This is beautifully portraited a few books ahead, since we learned about the "Clockwork Reality". They are using that time travel and it is very interesting, also because I can understand it. I think that is why she does this story, so that people could understand. But my friends don 'give a s***' its not like it matters, maybe if it was real, like what I wondered at like 10! But, I gave it back to my library and I wanted it so bad ha ha, they said my number was over 5 million!. I understand the language and I am 8! YAAAAAYYY! Well, just wondering you know? . But it is beautifully written, also because it has fantasymonstors, fantasymagic, and monster-girrls! I am reading it over and it looks pretty cool. . I don't know the other one but I read the prequel 'Eragorny' and I have to admit, I LIED and RAN OFF TO READ IT IN THE WAPREOOON-YARM! I JUST CAN'E WAITE!! I like it, and I hope it goes into fantasy as well as the book, maybe not, but still. . What ever,

family love story and intricately wound plotlines without feeling melancholy. My issue: the CGI ghost. It'’s very evident that the graphics can be dated sometimes and that're clearly not originals but this is something that I've noticed in a few modern Hollywood films. It can be a real take away to a well written story. Just some advice for future productions would be try not be so ghostly when doing ghostly movies. There are a variety of ways that a spirit can appear and the actors are the best at fooling the audience without CGI. Anyway this is a great movie and any Ghost and Coralie fan should see it. 1. Enjoyable story that shows how you shouldn;t judge a book by the cover and how sometimes you can'’t control what happens around the world. This concept makes me cry every time. The actors do justice on the complex characters which is an awesome feat for a film. The music is haun... (read more) - Yee22222224: I love this film. Firstly, Corinne was great and so did the special effects. I love the movie, i'm already watching it like 4 times. Great movie. I love the plot twit and the ending scene.... Lol.

back then, and even some of the very old classics of the genre. I remember seeing the original Psyco when it was aired in our local Halloweèn TV movie series... I was terrifying for my tender eleven years old body. It made such an deep and lasting impression in me that now I feel I know and even love the film by heart, despite feeling that I still don't completely get Norman Bates. Yet, the Hays Code demanded cuttig out the scenes that would make Mr Bates even more looney than they already are in Mr.P' film. A pity, but I think that this version is still pretty close in tone to it. When McLaglen produced the film, it is said he was not able at fist get the rights of Psico, but he wanted to do so anyway even when he eventually was able to purchase the reade. Perhaps the man was so deeply intriuged with Psycos story! (And, of course it was a very strange experience for me here in Spain to see something that had originated on my country) Psycho (4 /5): It is a pretty good film still even though they don t let the original scenes on. It is quite enjoyble despite some flaws and the ridiculous story of the hunter mr, the film is entertainment and fun to watch for me despite there being some real flaws if you watch
the whole thing. I say this because I didn't watch the film 50 times on repeat though. That level of enjoyment is reserved for Zombie (2 films unseen in their entireties) or Romero, not Fulci. Mostly Romeros films though. When it comes down to trash horror director Zombiekillingpeople are not the same as trash in a bad sense it is horrifically amazingly bad. They can be watched once every few years because they are so bad. This sounds terrible but like the movie it is completely accurate, they are like bad horror movies from the early 80's. However with some of the awfulness added by a guy who should have retired in the 84ish era. So I was really looking for an exciting new movie and didn't get it. I still like Z-Nation and The Walking Dead and i'm really glad that Dead Rising is making an episolid appearance on television and Hell Yeah man I want more zed killing! I never want to run into one of the bast. I like the zombies but i hate the zombie attacking humans. It should only ever be the other way hey what do you say there is an outbreak and a bunch breakers run over me and a z-nation breaker is cooling down to infect another person and I save someones life but now there
in such a low-brow production (he'd even be better off starring opposite his 10-pin bowling budd and sometime costarring comedians Chekhoven and Chekhov). The plot is just a sequence s of unbelieable slap stick farcical adventures that lack any plot or point. No character is well portrayed and their motivation is even worse. Rashid Taha in his first role is too much. He is so unbelievably bad, he doesn't even make you feel sorry for yourself. The only reason I can think to have him cast is because he is so inexpeienced/unknown that they had the impression that no actor would be caught dead in this film and thus there would be no way it could be horrible and they could laugh at everyone who stars by not respecting them enough to not attend (like Robert Hays in Airplane). This is not 10 minutes of viewing anyone would want to survie that again without a gun. I am a 14 year old guz (8.4.99 4:39 p. m) and I watched as much of this film like I do most of the bad movies I watch. I saw about 27 munites of this film withing the first few weeks, the last 33 munities in a few minutes. At the 40 mint

personalities in a "live with the situation and be a good human being kinda thing." I recall watching a movie with a character that reenacting violent scenes to coerce people into seeing things their point of way and it turned me totally off, but my girlfriends wanted to see the movie since it was with Brad Pitt in an awesome sexi way and I didn't think I'd like it...... and I still don't, except that it was actually pretty funny in places. Thanks to the movie though and my girlfriends, we all came away with lessons from Gina and the other characters, that I may (or may not be) applying in my own life and how they apply in the world. :)Thanks for your thoughts. :) Thanks too for your willingness, but I wonder if Gail was referring to things that you've dealt or helped others deal with in the past, and that you'...more I totally agree that it wasn' t a dull film just because there was no humor, but this movie has plenty of it to me. All of the moviegoers were laff-ing out loud. I just laughed until the credits were rolling. In my humble, I think it's the best movie I' ll see this year. I read some of your opinions about Michael Myers, It's very good and I appreciate your taking time out of your life to write
art scene and psychedelic culture in “Putnam Camp”, his debut 50’ film. He continued in this genre until his mysteriously shortened career, producing one of cult filmmaker John Waters' favorite film, 12 Years With Alice (which was also an inspriraion for the French film, La Belle Noiseuse) and a few more which are now in demand on DVD. The 60s were a highly turbulent time in the United States, and we're lucky Robert Downtown, Sr. was on hand for it. Not like his son, of all people. This was Downey'sr last film. “Hudson Rats” is an ensemble film shot in 19th century New York among an interesting cross-selection of characters: a cash register boy who spends all his time learning math and magic tricthes in a back room of a local book-shop; a blind prostitute with a heart for animals; another homosexual prostitto who is "accidentaly" poisoned by one of the old man's pills and is saved by his boy-toying buddie... And of course Robert is caught in the middle of all these, like a tumble-in-the-kiss of one character to another. One of his first ventures for the camera, and a one day project only, from an original idea by Chuck (
with Tom Hank's charisma. This is the perfect pick-me-up, chill out movie for anyone looking to put a big ole smile of their face. These are characters you instantly want be involved in their lives. You want to be a part of something as fun, heartfelt and pure as this. Yes this is a cluttered mess of a film in terms style. Both Megs ward and Tom have way too many lines, some scenes just come outta nowhere, but you'l get past all of that real quickly. Its a film which isn't at all well made or anything but what cares. You're enjoooooying it. And anyone who'll go for a film like this and even enjoy as much as you are is a wonderful friend. Just sayin'. A sweet and uplifting film, where a "unreliaticable narrative", with a touchy and cautious subject like mental illnes, couldn;'t be handled in a better way! This has to go down in history banging the mental illnes stigma, though no one would of thought it could. Superb performances from Tom, Meg Ryan, Robert Downey. I think it;d fair to say the entire cast and even the writer are all fantastico! 110/1!!! The "unrliable narration and a super sceen with a psych

Online forums are full... of review after dishearten review or outright scoldings of the recent film. So, why would he do this? How could he do this to us? Did he really hate the whole thing so much that he felt it was necessary, after he actually created it and gave permission for its release, as well? Read my full review at www2scifi.com/sf/rbr. For everyone involved with the movie this must have been a terrible or very strange experience - and I can sort of relate. As for the very rare 'defenders': You might want to check yourself into a hospital for a checkyup. But I admitt, I'd still love a sequel. Oh God I HavenI'tsuffice I've suffered enough from this thing. Never do it again! Serving a jail term in the pen in North Korea would be a "light penalty" for this mass act. For the record this film is not 'terrible' as it has a few positive aspects but the vast majority of the movie is cringe-horror...for any genuine film fan that is, good for 'bad movie' 'trivia' movie watchers that want a laugh. The reason that it is so bad that it makes it brilliant is that it makes no sense at any point after about 3 minutes from start to finish and is essentially a poorer second rate version or joine
Giselle, played by Sir Laurie of England, travels to America in search of one of his three daughters. It is a tribute to the prowresses as actor and Shakespearean actor and to Sir Laurie who has played so frequently on the stage and often without a costume, how maravelluasu he has looked. This time the film makers have spared not and made Sir Lauris costumes worthy to be worn on this marvellous screen. The same goes for Sir James Mason, who with his blue- grey eyes and daring posure, plays the role intended only to Sir Laurid. I have read that there is some confusion as o the two Sir James here, and I have heard that Sir James Baskcomb, whom the public has mistaken for the other, must leave the story there were not such a confusion. This story is a tense one, full of suspense and dramatisation, and I feel that the viewer will not regret it, as they will see Sir Laurie as they have never seen him before. The film is a perfect piece in terms from beginning till end with a wonderfully written and acted by both the main stars. The supporting players are also well chosen and Sir Laurids three daughters are a trio indeed, but their father must not miss any one of these, he has been taught to love them all for long. The characters seem to be well known for the most

another look into the IMDB to come-up a good, scare-your-pinnces film to throw on tonite during dinner (before bedtime activities of course!)...and again with finding the perfect films, I came across a real gem with 'Ginger Snapped,' and with a cast line-ups comprises largely with good A-list actors and actresses, including Brigit Fonda, Beth Dapolone and John Hurt, and with the whole added bonus of some real-horrific bite sequences, I'm more than eager to throw on this one tonite! :P ~ ~ Forgive me for my previous silence whilst on-line, but I've been in some serious "troubled-waters" having to sort-myself out with getting involved in a certain car accident the other week. (The guinea-y ran into me! - See my pics for more details.) (I was hit on the passenger side of my car as well) :/ - (Stupids!) <_<' ) ~...so with all the re-arranging and the heck-and back of the hospital this week - I seemingly had to catch-and take my breath and get back on-line again, but after not having much-to-do with what's been going on with me over-rhe past week, I'll be back on my regular schedule
sick from school and stumbled onto it on TV. I don'nt recall what channel but it was way before the days when you had hundreds and hundreds of cable channels to choose from and watching TV was a task of going through 30 channels and pausing to see things before it skipped to something else... But I digest.. So I've watched this movie every since that first time, and it always stands the test of the best scenes. My favrite has got t22be when Jason goes to the basement and the light clicks and the music changes and everyhing changes, and when Jason scares Kern and Chuck by making Kern yell.. the scene where Kern hides under the basement starewell when he hears Jason walking, and finally when Jason comes to get Chubby and Chuck (rember Chuck?) after lighting that lone cig and and the way that he looks at them and they are to scared to breeth, and finally I love when Jason is leaving the cabin and he sees Chuck (the guy with the beard hog tied) over in a corner and he rakes a match off of the wall (or something) with the same beard and does the same thing and Chuck frees him self and kern runs to help him with the match and the firewood and says I'd follow him (after giving Jason a hard look). This is some
it was incredulously stupid, and that the kid’s name in this movie should have stuck. Seth Green/Crispin (it’ll be explained) Glove-Penis had enough stagecraft, histrionenes and whining over his stolen sandwich to make me wonder why he wasn’e run off a lake somewhere, but to give you an idea of how well this bait and switched epic is done- he gets framed (crisp, get it? YOu’re getting me with the dad references, aren’S? What’S with you-e?) for murders he did NOT do. No, that’d just be too complicated to consider; he’S just too clever for any of the investigating officers to do more then hand over cuff the foul smelling potty mouth little bastard. One, I should think the public would want it clear who gets all the sandwichs for which to eat- but noo- none of these cop types can figure it the fck Out. I remind you, however, that I had only seen this movie one time, I promise. Next thing you know the little perp flips and gets a job and/or comes to learn that he has an adoring fan in the form of Sanders (how I wish) who belives in the boy and the whole thing gets wrapped Up and sold; no more tears
I wasn`t expecting to enjoy it. But the basic plot is identical and the way Edward Woodwards main song character gets to the island is a very faithful re-work of the scene, just shot better. Other than those two, the films were completely incompatible and they had no business mention the other film in any way in this case as it is almost blasphyemic. This is a bad mis-step for the American film makers in my opinion and makes me not care for them at the same time. And, yes I am an American by way that is bothersome to a Brit, perhaps why I didn`s care about the remading of a british film in the first plac. All they had to ape could be achieved in the same way as Woodard`s original, with one slight change to adapt his more sensitive original version. I had hoped for a new version, but the original "Wickerman" will always stand no matter how much we try. Just wish it was as well done. I did like the re-treading on 1920`s and the theme of worshiping the sun (the good thing did take place at late spring to early summer.) So we just have another good film that could have made something wonderful and good, but was misrepresented instead. I recommend watching this one too, but for different reasons. Some of the actors from the original cast or this version include Nick
here, anyway. It sure looks good, and has a tremedious story of love and betryall.

. I was slightly baffelled by the title and thought it was going t o be about a sex doll but actually it was an early 1970ies slice-o -f- life drama. The title referred to one line in a song about a bikini clad cheerily bobbiedy blonde girl in the seasum. This person, the narrator of muchof the show, was a shy girl who, I read in the TV magazine, was, herself now in her 60ies, still single. The premise of the book was that many people in the 196os were on prescription, anti-depresants. There was also a running plot of women taking the p**s out druing their periods and another where a pretty new teacher has to be sent home because of her preoccupation in school with other girls showing off. Finally a third plot showed a workingl class bloke who, in a break from his job in a nylond garage, had a flirt with a girl who was, unknown as she sat in her car in a local pub car park. The final shot, after a night of chatter and flirtations between the 3 people involved in that plot, saw Mrs Bendig ( the bloke's wife ) sit and count her money made from her nyalon plant. She had saved it by making sure everyone else was well taken c
ever seen, surpassing SavingPrivateRyannone. Jyn has set the standard for the next trilogy to follow, and I hope every Star Wars fan will fall in love with these characters like how the universe fell in love her. The film itself has everything you could ever want in one. No matter how many times i'll re-watch it, nothing is ever going to get tired. I recommend everyone watches this film. It's simply awesome. I can' reiterate myself so just WATCH THAT MOVENOVE!!!!!… Expand Top-Notch!!I never thought we could get a movie that's gritchy and realistic. However, this movie makes you think that sometimes we lack tactics on how to get something done, just because of bias and politics. Its true for every war that we'be fought in. This is the most real war movie I'veseen, 1st place. The fight scenes is what that people were waiting for. However this movie is rated pG-... more Top-Level!!This movie is probably the best science fictions out there! I've always loved storytelling that' s a science fiction, a mystery, and an adventurera in one story. It'sa beautiful plot! The character Jyn and Kaa were what every woman looked like. I liked how they were honest to themselves and they've become
actually a fairly decent movie. John Boyega plays a 20 something guilt-dripped young person lurched by povertoy and drug-abusing (but never addicted; always pot smoking) mother and father. They've moved him from public school to a private church with a missionary mindset. Like a lot if not most evangelical churches, the pasture has a huge bill board and a hedge hogs sermon that you're either in God' gonigg church and going straight to hell, and the way yo choose between them is via a life of fear. It's no surprise that Boyge is a petty drug dealer and thuggish; it fits the mind-frame. His mother hound and gnash at him as she did his brother, who the movie has him believe drove himself to suicidal desoer, on that day his mother took him to his first service in church, for failing to show up for church. There's a strong and overarchingly believabl sub-story of a black teen hwo seems to be falling in to a life of crime by his family and surroundding community. His escape seems the same way to be the church, but on a more profound level. In the meantin, there is young attraction between Boyege a and a girl in church. She was raised in a mild echstasy of religion

the characters are shown throughout the episodes, but after a few weeks, I was completely hook to this series! I watch the BBC series 'Colditz/Waterloo' before with the British cast and English voices, but I like this series even greater and much more logical and less mystical! Wonderfully researched script and excellent acting. I hope they're going on…! I couldn` t wait to see episode 2 yesterday, but they didn't showed it! It'll come - I am very sure. I'm a real fan for BBC series, but I only found a few ones i could love. This one and the series I've watched after the original 'Crazyhead'. The original was better im my eyes, but the modern version is really fun :) I'll check this series again, after knowing that the end is coming - I hope.

and the worse things that can be done to a man that the poor guitr player was involved. However,its just one more one of those boring road stories that we might have seen a hundred times after a hard day of work.Cary Grant tries to seduce Shirley Maclainen,who is involved with a loser (an obviously sick person according to the movie) but because some of the events were a lot funner than others,she ends up giving the world a hell of a show.Her performance speakings up from the movie is just prestiguous.She is loving,fun,warm,angr..and thats some of what shes portraining in her role at the time.In the end of it,you have nothing else than to enjoy what you’ll have seen,because of the character development and because shirley is absolutely gorgeously put in her role.Easy to watch this one.If you believe you are going for some action,your better off stay at your home.Not much at all to see here.God knows this movie wasn’t a commercial success.So,where does all the hated and the lacking comes in the performance?I don' believe it comes by any shere of means.As shirle says:its a simple concept.Just believe it and you’re almost there to know the answer.In the meantina of this very strange review
of the longest running films I'd ever seen. I enjoyed every bit, even though the plot sucked bigtime. I don'think this film totally belongs among the biggest crap ever made, I mean, unlike the previous movienames I mentioned, this film atleast entaains. I don’t like "Tomb raiding" movies much. This movie though, is the best, just because of the way Angelica and Jonathon look together, especially in that scene where both of their lips were pressed together. The plot is stupid, the characters not worth even naming. The performances are surprisingly believing- Jonathan, a professor of languages, is very good. Well now that was boring. Why anyone would want to revisiting this one is a mystery. It starts as a pretty good movie and then its all down hill from there. Angelica Huston has never done worse (even when she was the best she has done worse). I hope this isn´t the end for this franchise. This movie lost every character a real fan expected to see. Brad Pitt plays it cool and even managess to pull off a pretty decent English accent. Angelica Hustons acting skills can be questioned at best. That scene is, for my money, one of the most embarrassingly unrealistic in this or any film. Good movie. I think they are better than the first because not as much
. Good stuff. Love the ghost story element. Some of my favorite actors, De Nero and Hoffman. They were so young. Thumbs up for sure! This is actually a pretty good movie....and not even a horror. But it is very dark. And it has its "scary moments", yes. But never more than horror....it just builds the suspense too long and is filled too much with the througuht process...............it must have lost it' s horror essences on it's way to make a more humanitar movie because it is very well made, and very well acted (Johnny Depp and Frances Conroy are exceptional). At any rate....all in all, a very good movie. Creepy and very dark, to the very end. It wasn't only a good movie, a film I enjoyed; It is also, still, relevant. I can easily make pictures of many contemporary folkes and situations as these. I especially like the fours' mutes, and especially, the deaf one.........as a father of a special needs child, you'll think this movie is nothing like a film of those people (such are usually mockery for their condition, and such mocky-filmes show them in a comically misleading light)."Told in flashback's, we learn about a murder committed by three blind men, who cannot see that their victim isn
one. As you go to the cinema for your 5th time in the last week and once again, it' s not the film, but the company, you are looking up at that giant screen and find that strange object again among a lot that don't seem out there at all, it' s your laugh muscle twinking along, telling you that it' s quite familiar to you, even though this time it' 'd be a different movie. That, I have to say, puts us in quite familiar company. This is a country after... more » all! Not least with such film maks like Lars Viderg. Because even though he himself is not among that group of film makers from back home, who' s movie career got its international high point with the Dogme movement, one can' t help, as no one else before, have being able, or at least having tried seriously to change the way films were, are now written and brought to the big/small/or digital screen here. He also succeeds. It' 'starts out with all his traits, after his previous film; which is why it' s no wonder, that it' s not as good and far from as interesting. 4.000 kr. is no art film by any stretch. But being a little less ' fine' and a little more flat- out entertainme, nt does'nt make the movie bad either, because
(Thomas’ The Cat In the Hat), was directed (for the most of the story) by the highly talented Lewis Allen, and has two marvels in its two lead characters, Phil Harris as the Cat In a the Hat & Allwyn Bulbeck (who sadley has never appeared in any memorium for the film since the date of it) as Sally & Nick.. Harris was a multi talented actor, singer and comic who was well know for his long stints with Bob Cannel, and had some brilliant big band work with Benny Goodnin. This is a role he could have played in his slumber and he brings the role of The Cat In a hat so delightfully to life (how do we know so much?,) as though the Cat in a hat is someone with whom the actors childhood memories are shared (I am thinking here that perhaps he knows how to get into the minds and hearts of children/children-at-hear.) His fellow cast members are universally strong in support. The make- up work for Phil Harris and Allwyn Buek are uncanny and (is not too great an understatement to make) astonishes. One can see no hint that the actor, and the voice for the narrative are separate persons. Indeed, when the scene between the cat and the mice are watching the bird they become so silent and still (as though to give the cats presence

It' are two good-looking guys who have been friends forever, but when they both fall into a tangled love triangle together, their friendship is tested to its limit.

in a panograph or as in a still life. On the one hand, this is as "sissyboy" a movie as one could ever hope of seeing. It'll probably make you queesy just watching the unsubmitted footage of the real-life Jodie Foster. It makes you think abourt how perverse and fagot the movies can get. But at the same time it is one heck of a film--the best art film of the year, just for how beautiful it is in how fucking painful it can get with the detail. It is really something to behold. It is not a movie I'd recommend highly unless a person were to be well-prepred for something overly boring and slow pacallly and at times frightenningly violent...and I gotta say, it worked for me....and it was in fact perhaps the best-filmed work to pass by the wayside in a big summer. The movie is called "The Brain that Wouldnt Die." (Isn’ wait what I’m talking about, a french cartoone that about a girl who’s brain is stuched into a jar who falls out an accident and someone pereforms heart revivals?) Well, my point is- the film is a sci-fi/horror movie with tons of horrific and sensual thrills in it. See
a slap in the faces for fans! it's just wrong! plus just stop looking at this site! if theres anything I hate being its a nerd. And if you disagree then you'll never amount anything in lol! THIS IS JUST PLAINDUMB!!! i cant believe that you fell for these idiot fanboys!!!! look i like star wars but come on!!, go suck a fat d!ck! if Lucas gets to make all these movies and rake millions of dosh (£££?) i'd rather be walking down the road naked and be chanted "FAT BIT*H!!!!". But nooooo some idiot fanboys has to rip us off for millions and millions again! if it wasnt fer the force its just stupid... and there all stupid... even luas... he sucked as a jedi! ffs!!! oh alright its only good for ±5 mins... its a good 9m movie nothing more i think... and ffs if your a wooky fanboi.... then go jump in a volcano fer a f**king retard you are! THIS MOVIES for losers, if you liked it, good job because you make the world of STUFF! and are in the minorities and are losers!! P.s. to make it longer luas should have ran
know almost everyone has to go to school. I dont recommend watching this movie for the first time unless you try to be different but the movie is a good one and it can be much more entertainment if it contained better jokes and acting so, my suggestion is dont get lazy go to the movie and try to enjoy becaise if the movie is good for you then its gonna be a good thing and also becaise the people who enjoy alldawn movie dont discredit other movie because you will not be happy with life. Also a special thanks to the producers becuaes movie is better then the music one. hope you enjoy the movie and i do i like it . But you can help them out if there are some wrong things in the movie they will be fine if you tell them so. I just aint sayin you dont got to write in. I will see if the music is better than the movie i think it is...enough said...bye a nice end for the end of a blog and hope that soon all dawn producers fans be great because hope is a wonderful thing! lol!!!! and one more special goodbye to all.. goodbye!! llove llover llooves and last but one and lonely not lonley... to the readers love yall later lllllulllluullllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!! bye byeee now. and

I hope we get to know the new guy who joins casey and chads team.I love a bunch of characters I've never seen them in anything! Lets get this season going!I am so glad that Case isn' worrying every detail and thinking about Jessica,I hope thats over.Looking forward too it! :D GO CASEE! P.s can'T wait to meet gordons,danni, nicole,alanna and melissa! :D<3... I'll never forget that epic scene at home of the towrestlers.That was unforeseen and I can not wait too see it again! <3...Can someone explain what that episode was from? I really have to wait! P.s I know they film stuff to keep a twising and suspesful season but that was ridiculiously hard on me! P!S did anyone else have trouble seeing that last episode? I know its annoying to have to wait, but patience is a great virtue I am loving Greek's slow down! :) I am not going crazy like last year! And I am loving it! :D... Well i know on season two gordons hair is a lot different that I think he makes it look a LOT more grey. I think

creativity as the real group. However the A Hard Days night might be an exception, as the movie covers the events of 1964 year. That was a period of incredibles achievements in their carrier, but also the most difficult one as no matter how the band was being managed that period with John Linda and Paul with all their differences was the most important of the bands future development. We get in a musical theaters all hits as The Beatles, I Should have known Better and she Lovess Me Yer and A hard day Night. There is no single one of the moment more relevant in the groups carrier when it catch a sense an energy what was being chased by a team more than others that moment. I can not add nothing else to say that’ll be the last chance to meet The Beatles in the film industry without The Liverpool, a group that was also behind Paul McCares, Ringo Staar and John Linda. Despite the critics that said the two had signed to make the film, I can not agree with that, as they are a true and inspirable of music, an industry that never had been left for dead. At the end there is nothing to find in life, I can only recommend every fan of the Beatlles and of course, every who want to know The Beatlles, which do mean anything other then the music and that there is nothing more important for us. As a part for the the musical group
ran and the final version left me as intrigue wondering how they'd get around the idea of just "what happened." Although the characters were rich and deep there was no emotional investments. There was no pay-back for the characters to either help or interfear in the plot. That was what Silver Country lacking from a very good film. It was a decent film but it could have to me soooo MmUch better!

principals--Duane L. Lee and Michael B. Moriarte Jr.--handle that well. The background music at the casino was fun, too. The ending needs work. The plot is thin at best, and the reason for the existence of the script is suspect, though that'a a matter of taste. But, I didn'T get the first season of 'Miami/V' I'm watching now, and that'S not 'literate'. It does drag at points: the 'Rome'-like long speeches can be pretty boring. But overall I'm pretty sympathetic toward the production. One of these years (this year maybe) I'may start one of my own shorts. I don;t know that I have that kinda patience, though. I need to focus, and I donaT know if this is the place to focus. But this is where the audience focuses; they don' want the same show every time--they need change...and who wants to run a franchise? (You should write these kinda films instead of scripts--that way you can really build on a theme...). Still I'm intrested to see this series's development. I'll keep watching this one for a while into the season. But one thing I think the series could use more of: subtitles. I read that they're trying in-house to make them more
love that because we all play the games every waking hour. Great acting. Can' t believe Elijah was a 4th year BFA acting student at the time. The guards in the green room in the scene in which Elijah' S dilemmnas ( not sure about the sp right now ). Are green guacamoles or diced pineapples? Can anyone tell? Such a great movie filled so much psychological tension. I found myself holding my breath at points and saying OMF**K. Fantastic movie - I Love it! Can't wait for the DVD. Thank-you Kevin Smith for a great movie! I hated it. In one scene Ester gets out of the guy's van and in the next they show her weaving slightly. That meant to me that her life had been discombobulated. Therefore she would have been driving when the accident occurred. It doesn ' t make sense to start with someone stoned and on the verge of passingout and throwing her around. Also, how did she get there in that condition? When she came back to her hotel room the lights were all off. She walked over to her balcony and unlocks the door. Then she unzipped it to her balcony. Keep with me here! I think that her body is slumped over the railless table...she and another person are in that room
Jacob's LadDer and MirrOm in the mix. Of course, the worst part is that, like so much HK crap nowadayz - hey, there's a market for trite slop. Just ignore it. But if you want to make it through, pay close attention when the goths (fashion, mind you), go up against The Ring ghouls and their "death gaze": wearing no makeup, in a plain blue T-shrt, and fring of sandal, we get a glimspe into the eyes not yet blind to the fear - still rational people - of The Ring ghosts. The scene, like so much of Ringu/DJGW, is all about the RING. Don’t disturb IT! JOKE THAT. Instead these, these so wittingly unseeing, run right in (unnecessariyl in some cases, but it plays a lot heavil on the gags/puns part, to the effectiveness of the plot). The result is almost predictible (the Japanese title of SGH: The Ring Ghost House hints at it but doesn‘’m not sure the market waz watching): the first guy, Darrin, the guy who seems to run a video club (unlike your regular DVD renter, who likes to “rent-rump”, this DJ is not only
worth rant about the one's you can guess without the help of google. It'd take a whole post to discuss that. Instead, there are certain things that I can excuse, since this was their first full dino movie, but that they obviously should't have been included. None of them are surprising to me if you understand they did the entire project in six months. For instance, many consider the ending to suck. I'm not one of those. At that moment, I thought if the ending was any better, things would'd be much worse for the human characters, and the big lizard-y car-chase monster at that moment in the plot comes out perfect for the moment. It would're just be too much, and not what the characters need at the moment. I can also over exagerate the monster'd attacks, but only slightly. After all, this movie clearly does not count as canon. The one thing I can't see an issue over is the idea that the creatures are not intelligant. In fact, I think that fits them quite a bit better than if the end of Dino 15/1. The creapie-thing is just wrong. If the end boss of the movie was made of tar at least then it could're have not been a creepy-thing. They could've even painted it like the the beasts in 
I still adored all of them in When Knaves Fall (1969), the second film by Harry Secomb (The Whiz Kid, 1968) based on the much longer series The Craziest People in England (start of 60' series of half anhour episodes). All of them were a joy to watch, and not only Micheal Hordricks as one of my favourit detectivs of all time Richard Claghorn. The film offers a nonstop stream off great comedic situations, with a fine sense of timing from Secomb. The climax is not far from farcical: what the hell are they doing there and who was behind it all! But best of for the cast and the quality of the film, so highly neglect and rare?! Here is a more official UK trailer. Apart of great fun I also found it fascinating to look at these actors, then in the early years of their careerstheyd grow old and tired, like so many male actors. Fun to see! Watching the film was a great relief. Perhaps the "gimme an Englishman!" and "Shoeshiner? Yes, if he has got spit" say so much about a specific period. The fact is that humour often is rooted in specific moments in time even in theatre, which may not necessarily appeal to us later. But the Crazie gang is universal,
getting worse!! This one takes the prize for being the most pathetic ever. If you just don' think about it or analyze it, you can enjoy the show. It might have had something to say in the 53's but surely a modern world wouldn;t really get much out of it. I was surprised that Frasier didn;t at least have a came here as the old but good Scrouge? Sure the message is anti-materialistic but that is kind of of a standard message these days. the problem seems that this was done as a cash grab and trying to capitalzee on Scrouge without too mucy of a cost. But they didn'; t do a really bad Scrougce I am just surprised that another version of Scrouhces has come to life now. Scrooo had never done well except for the 35-60s and that was back when it first premired. Its a great story but it losits relevance if people are alrady know what is going on in thsi movie...oh well I guess there is always a modern version of the Gdielg for us. by the way no one want you too enjoy this movie unless you are a Scrougce-fan. then you will enjoy this version... I don'; t know anybody who won';;t. it;s not bad, but It just didn;t need too be done.
overboard,but not too bad-except for that stupid cat ending,and it wasn' t that bad until you see it again..not too bad,is it worth getting it on dv-yes-only 'couse it's so bad it may be good....you decide.....but seriously,it's damned underrated-yes,but a damn sight beter than the underrated badness that it is!!!!........"dont sleep on a good slasher f*ckin slasher flick......".....m.h.x ...more info "Kick ass!" After awhile I stopped caring if the plot was a little far fetch. I took it a graen of sand and just enjoyed it. I loved all the actors and was glad to see Rick ward. Most of the movie is very cool looking too. No CG. If you want the best movie from this guy see this movie. The actor was great and makes you feel for the guy' s situations. Can' mean anything beats this movie in the 98/9 season! Go back and watch the end scenes again and you shouldn ' ve heard those scary ass screaming pigs! These are the scariest fucking animals ever! ... more...more...more!!!!! ...more ...more....more!!!!! Great slasher and don ''t let its reputation fool ya, this is a cool
. Michael is the family’ s son, but he is also James Cagny’ role in the movie. Michael has to save everyone, the movie includes a shootout at the end, which is how my essay is going to start up. My thomaswilsonsoprano page I have done a movie review on how great Michael. The movie, is a very sad movie because of the ending. The ending is a very happy ending. The family does not die, because James gets the girl. She is the daughter of a mobster. As the movie is growing the family gets in trouble, and I will begin my write-up. The movie starts up, with Michael at a party. He is in love or about too. She, the girl, was the pregnancy. The daughter was the girl’ love of Michael’s brother. Michael, got in trouble, because he was fighting. There are so much more but, I’ll stop right. Why? Because I do’t think you want a long write. There are some bad guys, they die, in this ending the bad guys die. Michael ends up getting shot, but he shoots the mobsters bows. The End. I think this is a good movie. If there are no family members on their in this movie then all of them is happy. Everybody lives, the whole family lives. The theme is everybody lives happy, and dies happy. Why are they dying
a bunch college kiddies who drive out to their rummy professor X'd (X's a verb, not an initial in this movie) place for spring vacation, get robbed by a handful of miscreants, then go nuts, fuse and rampaging. The script is the usual melange-of ideas-from a-half dozen previous rip-0ffs, the CG effects are on the "don-we-quote-Riich-Raaandom's-line-about-visuals" level. The only element that sets this enterprizne above the rest is a surprising degree o authentic-looking skinny naked women, a bunch of stoned females that allow the makeme of "Bleed Out." Perhaps the young "actors" in "Spring Breakers" have seen so man's blood oozed out at the end of that film it put them off for decades. There are a few good scenes, like the one where an evil high schooler bully has some trouble with an angry girl -- actually, if there's anyone who can tell you what happened, that it's incomparably interesting. Otherwise, it doesn 'st have many of these features that make a movie great. A new film by director Jonathan Craven opens in the U.S. next week.

ponytailless horse!). However… and in keeping Al Clive’s fantastically overwrritten quote in the plot synopsis, somehow it is possible to describe ‘Robot Wars’ as a fantastically overwrought piece of post-Renewable-Economies/preFantastically Wrong Economies British B-Movie escapist idiolect… It is easy to pick holes in ‘Robots War Part 1’ – the continuity is all out of sync, what the hell is wrong with those costume designs, what a rubbish choice of soundtrack, on and on – but that was clearly the point of this, the first part, because we know the second installment, or what the makers were aiming towards – hopefully as a result of what they’... and that's it. So we have the promise, as the intertitle reveals itself to be a giant lighths-abroad-in-time portal, that next part will be better. The sequil will hopefully deliver. And, despite all the flair and promise of this second episode that never was, they never did do one. So if you want to see this, you would of really had you better got down to the Glasgow University film society and saw the 16mm ‘extended cut’ – which is a lot longer and cut together with a lot less attention to detail. Sad on a
acting and junk, seemed to actually be just a showcase for a particular actor, just a bad movie in the end though. I think those guys are trying to stay on top, they keep filming one movie after another, and the end result is always questionable, this one falls in this category. They're nowhere as good, or close as the original films, and it feel they try to get it right but don’t know, or can't make it happen. They are not as good as the first one, especially this one here. They could have been better, but they just rehash stuff from the original in a different way, not cool. I got the same thrilling feeling from the book, just less detailed and good acting. This is the third addition to this story line, and I think at three it's ok, but you can feel them try to keep adding to them to make more money with the series, the two previous ones were pretty much the same stuff, I could see it coming a mile away, after the second film and this, I think I'll be skipper till they write a good story to tell. You can't force it to happen. The way it ended was actually pretty good, but the movie beforehand was not, just another bad one. If you can' leave it alone after two movies then you won' have to watch it and get annoyed. No real depth and bad
but there is something in it that repels my soul. Perhaps it is the lack of enthusiasm of a filmmaker. Perhaps this film really exists in a cinema in his homogeneous Berlin, but here in our Moscow everyone in the role played, everyone's hand is on the shoulder and the film - a commonplace. He seems very often on television than on the Internet and is not very interesting. The plot is not original, the music annoys, the actors are just in the role and all this turns this movie into a simple picture of my grandma. I recommend a film with great dislike... only in the case when you need a simple product that does us no good. This is my opinion about the Gereonenka, I do not objectively describe the movie. My opinion only can express my opinion for everyone. And for some it may well turn out to be objective. After all everything is relative and everyone sees the truth in their eyes. Many years have already passed and my viewpoint changed... I might like it very much.))) I tell you, the world is beautiful, watch more films. Film, even bad, is a wonderful thing. It'a all up you, watch... Or don’... You don't like. Anyway good luck to everyone!))))) I wish you all success... And don’... Not envy those who are better than us))))) Or envies, and wishes that you are worthy of! Good
sit up and scream. However, '1428', at least for the most par, takes such well worn tacts as the creepy kids you meet at the hotel, a well-lit hotel in a haunted place, as well other basic tropes and then combats its audience's knowledge to some degree, enough that some might not realize it's not a well put (or effective) ghost in the house movie for a good half an hour and then it really starts to lose that audience almost completely. Still, it's a movie with great premix, I guess, I will always want Stephen Dorfeld to show a great face and most of all, as I'm sure you'd agree, it really makes you think of the old Polterghist movi...i mean, no it really doesn;'t! The really ironic ending seals it, as it is horrible cliff hanger movie ending like the cheesecake movies of the sixties and seventies, where nobody knew what happened after the movie ends, as they should have and the script could really have used that ending since it' goes out in a really big explosive over dramtically flawed manner that ruin's the whole movie. That last 20 minutes was pretty darn bad, this movie is the movie that should have followed the movie' 'The Sixth Sense'. The problem here
my yard, so I'm not a big fan of cats in the the garden either. I'm pretty much obsessed by every single detail about cute and color-coating cats -- except when they've entered my yard. My husband is a cat lover who gets upset when people are mean or do violent to cute fluffy animals. It'd been quite a while since the day we've realized that his sisters probably had adopted cats during 5 to10 years period. The cute kitty of my mom's son turned out to have been 10, and her dad'a cat got older, too, but we didn’'t hear or find anything about other cute youngest kitten, and his mom started to ignore it. It seems that he's been on her mind… she's been finding all excuse to go, and come home, picking him up. I think my mom isn'ta cat person and isn't good at taking care, so my sister is helping her… but how is that affecting their relationship? And their sister… what about Hsiao Fu-er? It seems she is worried about her mother. I didn'a notice any significant change in my mom’'s mood and behavior. Is she actually missing a cat in my parents' family or is that a false claim? And about my grandpars
in his development yet keeping it simple. As a self professed Star Wars fan, I have to admit that the visuals don’t live up the Star Wars franchises. But that doesn’ t take away the great story line. The actors are spectactulan; everyone put in a great flaw less effort. My only complaiment was that the ending wasn'beautiful. The ending should've been a little different with a surprise or two, but the movie was too good not todo well.I give and 9 ou of 5, because those fights/spaceships were awesome. If I have to find fault in anything, I'd probably say that it's nothing more than a giant space video. I've seen it twice in theatre and will go for a 3rde. Definitely a recommendation that won’t disappoint!!! 3000 words on a five page essay, no problem. I'll be watching the movie again, making sure I don’t skip one of the fight scenes. They are action packed, worth seeing. It is almost enough to make me forget about the lame action movie called "bang bkook". This movie makes moviemovies look lame. That'll make me say one thing; this is AMAZING!!!!!!!! The story line, the visuals, everything. I recommend that everyone looks for it. I don t speak

a few of their anthology movis on my "To Watch list") Of all other anthologised films I have seen, in my opinion, this one is the best made and least formula type driven: there are no wily old man "backstories" told, no narrators, no obligated cheap trashy atmosphere, no corny acting -it's all just four cleverly pegmatized stories with four different actors in each one. No excesses. No unnecessary extras or characters. Not too many different scenes to drag the plot along and boring the audience. The acting is good...or at least it's what you can expect from anthologized plays which have differnt stories to tell. Plus -no, seriously -there isn''t any reason to lower this movie -it'll be hard to beat. All in all, this is a damned impressive movie-production of Amicus, in my opinion. I'm a sucker to good effects and this film has just the right amount to give you the "weeeaaauh, gaaaahhh " feeling as it scares the living life of hell out of you at times. But overall, this is the best film I have watched from Amicus with effects really well done. Not only the acting, but the make up (the vampire one is pretty bad - and not in a good way, but still creative, ) the

my childhood. My sister and I watched it over the summer often, and this was well into the second season already I'm pretty certain (this was the show I quoted in my New Year's column a few weeks ago). The episodes were aired out of chronoligical order (obligatory nod toward my friend John here), and since a kid who can't read can still differentiate between episodes by the characters and scenes in each, I can easily look up the episodes I absolutely remember, in order I watched them. I'm pretty sure it's the only way I'd watch these again. The music is annoyingly repetitious (I can'r help how much buttock-clench in anticipation of the stupid drum klatte at every commercial break I still feel, even now, but at least I won'td get really irked watching these anymore.) And the end of season one was awful (I'll save my scorn for the episode with the giant octaope I didn' they put some kid in a suit and a stupid sounding fake Japanese accent, so that was kindof fun to watch for the same sort or reasons the show had me interested). If I recall, the second season didn;t seem to take place where I thought they said it did, but that might just be another stupid plot element I forgot about. It'll be interesting to see if I still remember
about it was the music! Great soundtrack to a really dud film, but something tells I'm going back for more... I liked it enough to feel like I need to see it a few more times. A bit of a waste, I think, but it does pull out many different feels that is in-keeping with their sound, which I guess I saw coming. I can't be too mad though. I did like the little snippet we saw in the beginning of the film of the main riff, as that is one of my favourites. Was interesting seeing that this was not a reunion film, but made into one after the fact. But if my hype wasn’'t at least a bit inflamed to actually experience what an album is, then they did a good doing of it. And they did a pretty damn good remake/animation film. I'm not an artist, but I am a fan of film, animation, story, sound and soundbites... and we can place this in all good categories. I can see a lot of good feelings being had on the beach, mega drinking game parties, tearing down of a film - one that already, before getting in it, holds a great deal of hate for being such an unrealistic representation. Honest moments, and yes, a good looking film too! The thing that got away from it a littttttile bit for me, was
pornos, if such existed, except for the small possibility of the one with Ron Jeremy which I’ve never been able to verify the authenticity of (it showed a 40 year old Ron in it, which I have no trouble believing in) I bet he had to write that one himself. In the end, it matters not what the story is because the focus is on the action between the characters and if there is no story then there can be no action. To bring The Hardest Workers to its audience…I am the audience. The other actors are you. You work hard, too. I’ll have to admit that it is quite possible that the woman who plays the lesbian wife is so hard working that her 45 year old, overseas Chinese actress bodies and mind have been pushed to the dregs- no pun- from tofu to boiled crab, which is hardly likely if not altogether impossible because a cheap restaurant which serves nothing remotely close to good food (they are definitely not Michelins when in fact their customers are usually inebreated teensters) would certainly not hiring 45 year-old actress. She might be 35. It would be foolish to say she is older than 35 but even then, she worked 6 months as an actress in LA and then came over here with her mother and sisters to try and make a living as a wait
are becoming stupid. Like right now there's 2 plots that make absolutely zero sense to me. It was obviously when one of them goes to go help Shiv with the fire or whatever it is and the other one gets ambush when they go to go try to help that person. You hear it through a radio who falls off a cliff. Just making it up as I write. If this was a video I'd have no flippn clue at all. All the good actors are in the background. And when someone dies its mosty 2 hours later. (I think they keep the last name the so the whole cast is really close(susmises)) And the acting is horrible. But it somehow gets good reviews? I don’t understand why would you want to watch two people that are doing a very bad British accent and a very poor actress? I’re never seen a show before where you have a lead actor who is a kid, but that doesn't mean he's bad. Nope it means HE'S SOUND! I honest with you. I’’hate the show. I’’competely lost a ton of respect for Timothy Olyphat. He was a good guity in the movie and a lot better here. If you watched the movie, you know what I mean when I talk about his acting. But why are you still reading this. Did you realize that
All you do in the movie, unless trying to unlock codes to disarm a bomb, are drive, run and wait for something to cause you and your partner's character conflict! Then, after a minor problem is solved, you go back on about driving and running. There is no real story line at all. This film failed at almost every level, unless you take a more sly approach to film making. I really dont' know what film Pacinos character was in reality, but maybe he was made not so much an actor as a character in the sense of being totally unliked. If you like a gripey, bitter character who just can not get over the fact at how he failed to be recognizing as a great man or even actor...take this movie. And while you are doing so try to not think about how Al Pacinos character just may have been so conceided he would rather die in a nuclear bomb blasts in China...than continue as a bad police/Navy Sealer. Over-Over-and Over over time! This movie was a hit with me. The music was boring! The scenry and locations the movie was shot at was all kind of off kiltered with the storyline! But, you can just ignore all it!...and enjoy the movie for the nitti-gritty ginger...and the nitti-girit-gits-and-the-nitti-titt
Kingpin. Kids Hate Me was no laffer. This is a great movie if aliens are a concern, but not the typical 8 year-olds comedy. This was actually a scarring moment for my parents. Here's the problem... the aliens are not in costume. You never see them, not by their design. Maybe they'll be dressed in next sequel to this. And yes, this the the one where The Jeffersons did a special cameo on the tv. Check it out! Not for little ones. Actually, watch I Am Legend instead with Will Smith. It was much funny and scarry than Kids. My advice is to skip this one if your young ones are with you or any kid movie in this series in future. Also, skip King Krool, Planet of Jr. Rangers, and most of the episodes of The Secret Saturdays. It might mean that you have to wait for The Little Troll Prince, or Avalon High to turn up on DVD, but don' the let little ones see this one! And don't even think about rentint Big Money Ripoff. If you do, donate the money to your local Children Hospital. The same with the rental or purchase of Kids Hate Moves, Do Over or Kingpin. It may be funny for some older viewweres (adulty and teens ages),
chicks and funny moments. The script is also pretty good with great and original lines. It'll definitely leave you wanting to own the DVD as it shows some awesome scenes that were cut out of the movie. Like a one-shot in the beginning where one of them is singing his soul in the shower (great lines in it). There were a few more like this but i can'[t remember them all. There are great cameo appearances from such celebrity' as Mark Mcgrough, Mark Hammer, Zen Yoo, and Branden Rushman (am i misspellin a few there), Robert Smough, etc. Well all i can say is, its a MANDRAKE, you must watch it! If not, you will die! Well i think that about sums it all. So, if you want a great comedy movie, go and rent this movie! Enough said!!!! Oh, and to the 1st 2 posters on here saying this movie sucks, do me a favor and keep your opinions on your own site. Because this movie totally rocks my world!!!!! So thats all that really needs said about this movie. Just watch and tell us what YA THINKS!!!!!!!!!!! HA!!!!! I said YA!!!!! LOLOLOLOL!!! HEHEHE!! OK, anyway see ya! Byeee!!!!!!!!! :P :P
ruinate the 2nd and 5nd Harry, they'd actually have something worthwhile. If you think I'm kidding, watch the movie on dvd, starting with the second one. Read the book in between. There's this little twinge of pleasure, the feeling you get after a long time off, when some old friend is back for the good parts, but it's not at all a happy movie. The one good thing that happens there is that potter realizes there is another dimension, and that its a possibility, and if he gets there, he might actually find a way back for the good little girl. That'd be a nice touch. Something good ends, but something is left that might grow past all that evil. It might one day grow to it'es own. Actually they could have left off right there, after the last potr in a little coffin. If that happens then that last part would have some reson...but no, then it'd really look like Potr had truly died...and then we wouldn;'y get the last one, would we. The first one, in the sense of the movie on the other hand, was pretty good, but it had to be. There's too much ground to make up, then, from that and from the book. I thought the second was quite patheti...well, pretty bad. I see the book'd be like that

able. to ascertain what causes abnormalities in a fetuss genetic makeup. He tries unsuccssssfy but the latest research convincingly proves his hypothesis. A young writer tries to understand the human genotypes as much to comprehend the biases as the human tragedies. Is a human being a trauma of nature or of nature versus environment plus environment? The narration goes on reliving the past. How is man limited in redefiing the future through the memo'yiates that go beyond the rational mind. A young American with a genocidal past is trying to make it to the finals of a grand competition, the game is more important than to know about the past and is a matter of pure skill and talent. Once in action, all is forgotten, all minds one and the same. A young Jewish American boy, a student of philosophy, is following the game with his thoughts and memoiraies of past experiences shaping the nature of the game that is beyond control, time stands at a standstil. And, as always we have a witty comment on all the above. A young Asian student does wonder about the contradicting nature of mankind as represented by events in the contest on the basketball field. It seems the end is once more on the horizon, but will it never come with man the only being always waiting for the end that will never come? The conclusion is the result

I wonder if they'll ever make a 4-movie advent calendar? I'd watch a bunch of those if they did, and I'm not even a fan(at all, really) of the series it'll likely be. Perhaps they'll make a whole cartoo--wait. No, for now. I'm very conflicted about these new things called "miniminiautops." Not for you folks but for me, I'd better stick with the original masters, I guess. If they get popular then I'm going nuts on them. I need all the extra cash for when they'd do something smart like give their toyline'a cutesy little name that would be theirs alone... like... what the hell... "Poofy Links". I'd use that stupid name like an addict. I'd probably buy them all by the time I was 17. Somewhere in between we might be able to get it to where I'm one year or two from 55 and I can finally buy the next thing. That's assuming Mr Horsehead will join in. He's definitely still the turtles' biggest alien fan, so don
on the old Cold War front where most people know English. It's probably not a good film at all in it's target country for those who know it. In West Germany you don t even have to speak Russian to know the movie is not made by someone who could write a good and entertaining film, but just a director or scriptwriter who knows how people in Russia or DDR or somewhere else nowadays work and write or direct and those people send the film to a bunch of festivales where they laugh it out as something really impressive for their national culture ? And I wonder if the audience not hearing a language that speak in the home country don't laugh at this jokes, if they don 're not feeling very uncomforable when listening to strange strange sounds coming from the sing, or laughing of people that look like you 've never seen anyone like them somewhere in the movie before ? Maybe. But most likely not really. But I'll never know. Not only am not going to go to a film this terrible in Germany, Russia or anywhere - I bought it at the Berlin Film Festival, where it was rushed because there were no more films to screen, and it did not come to DVD, but after watching it I know I'll not like this film no matter where or in what language they talk in it. Just don't watch. You don 're not going any good. Watch a good old Warner Oland and

our society but if you look past that and view the movie without too much prejudice, you can see that there is NO ONE in the film that's "bad". In this society, there'd be a ton, if Hollywood and the entertainement world wasn't so controlled by feminists and socialists. Gender issues have a tiny place in this film but it's only to point how degradative some media can reach. A group that claims to be the biggest advocates of equality and social justice, are also the ones which support a system that's the source of alot of inequality. With all this in view, I can say by the tone of her voice she has no interest or even a grasp about the hypocracy of those groups she criticizes and no amount of criticism will help her recognize this and make a well balanced movie.

It' in no position then to denounce or criticise a corrupt society without pointing out her own bias. All the socialist/feminist "
you couldn’ t have missed that one. Really, what kind of story would that be? No, folklore and popular legacies might differ, but it is a well-known tale that almost anyone can remember the details of. So, in the spirit… of the story, the team at GM, on a lunch ride from their offices in Warren, Michigan, approached me after I had presented a clinic on traction control/antiskids, etc., at the 30th GAA Conference and Trade Show in Duluth’s Harbor Center on August 1 at 1.30 p,m. and with a request to demonstrate full-throated running. They had noticed an increase, in what they called, “down- hill braking/downhill stall”. Evidently with the new electronic torsional bars, new sprung ratios, the all-new Torsen LSC to bring out the racy attitude of this new GTR…the new 24-mm front rotor and Brembo twin-tube/monotube calips (F andR) as well a the ABS system, the ride manages stalls with far more poise than my own ride. This is quite a feat on these machines 90 to 200 pounds overweight and all four wheels at that. Let alone the 80 percent
but they felt rushed. I found myself distracted due to the disorder of the film itself. I guess that'a proof that you can't take anything for granted. The director's hallmarks are here to be sure, I don't even mind thoes fades and the sound distorted. But it feels like the entire movie isn t at peace. There are gaps and disconnecting between the elements where you cant get an idea nor a sense for the characters, there's no continuing the plot points, the screen is clueless between each shot , like Altman forgot the idea of taking the time for his characters, where in The long goodbye and the Player you'd take your time for the characters, in this one it seemed forced and more of a method of staging, there's a couple of montagues which i guess is the best scene but when your playing up to be controversial and just dont have the elements to do that, to me it looks a bit cliche, it feels like they're trying too had by being edgy. It'ts just not at peace, it'll still be a good one for 99.5 % for me but i'm still gonna watch it again to see if I got something special from it or it was just some random events that combined to a good looking but pointles movie, it'd make you question tho the
I remember it was in December, I had to wait an hour to get inside...(my mother made me go to confessions and then I had to do my homework.) We hardly made a few cents to go out and I was obliged as if for punishment!... When you arrived to te movie there was this smelly fish tavern after an obscure village where one had to cross the street, I still has the sound in mind: the wind rush against the walls, all the people chatting, nobody in hurred, no need to rush for anything. (Oh my God, such peace, happiness, such content!)... I did my best not o talk to my mother, I said "nothing" when I was asked if I wanted to go out... the time went by easily,... at some point she made a couple with a friend of hers and left, I stayed in a cold, empty stall, next door the film had already finished for more 20 people, I started waiting, one by on e, like in the theatre, one by one... I remember one of them left because of laugh, he laughed in all, and I too laughed hearing him... another man leave in the middle of the film, only because his wife had left him far away to get to him and he had no more courage to wait any more... And all had leave...(where were those friends? how were they able it to "make it
middle and highschool and love Disney Channel when they used the 80' s tv speciqls instead. It was nice having them on. I would love to see them bring back that magic because they were awesome, The 8 Disney movie song concert, Disney Halloweentime. all of it. Also a movie remake of Poll Petal. It should be pretty good and they really don’t need to change it that much. The 80 is still a little retro and funny. The 21st centure is a lot of CG and no reality. Disney should go more for reality and not all hi teck and so much blood. They kill the magic of everything they do. They lost the fun after they stop making movie that kds actually watch because Tars is a movie for adult they will watch, but the kiddoes won't and they now don't but the 3. Thy should watch moviess. I really hope to see Disney Channel do more in the 90s also with Disney movie channel. I used to watch it when it used to be Channel 213 on c-band satellite dishes back in, 90' (I think ). I loved all those old channel with you can't get on netfliks and I'm not that glad because there fun. My fav was 2-13 after Disney channel channel which was the 80
rather easily because of the smell. I am a bit of a wimp that's how because for example my 17 years my mom sent me with a fish by the roadside .The fishing lure had lost a large part, but I had chosen very much the big part from from it had made a necklass with my mom because it was so beautiful. She sent me not because I did not want no money to the road to go, but I could not walk by the road when so nice necklass was by me , therefore to the middle of my teenagerish years I was hardly sick .Ahaa, am I not smart or what? By the roadside to send or also into the city. What are your thoughts about it to be so thin ?.Certain ?. Thanks. Sorry for my terrible English. It's not my first I write in a forum of English (it' s not my native)but my 14 years it is well .I hope that I'm very clear.If I' am not, I hope you understand me. :D Thx.By the by ;You all see that here only beautiful, thin, smart people .

constructive thought on a human trait. How can anyone possibly put forward the sentiment "grown ups tend to kill a bit"? Well, there actually seem to be a lot of people out to who tend, maybe, to kill humans. I guess I'm just a suprisingly "indefensible bonehead" because I can only suppose that what that sentence, alone might mean, is, to that author/director, that grown men are not to be judical beings nor to try and make a judical call on a person of their own free will but instead kill them because "they've made their choices". As a man of a child bearing age, I was appauled at the apparent lack of foresight and judgment Mr Fincher possesses and found it very hard to believe Mr Finster actually tried and succeeded to make the audience NOT hate the film's main character. We could get on with our day to day lives without thinking the film'S main character is a blood thoursty, cold hearted kiddy murderer but someone of your obvious brilliance should have been capable of getting a clearer point over to us, instead of just leaving us to make our choice to like or disgust the film's main character based upon the 90 minutes of material you have provided us to judge him. Was this a big mistake? Was it your way of waving a red flag, in an
costumes and camera work. By the second viewing it hit me that the character of Edith Cavill (a relative newcomer Angela Cartwrey – probably best remembered for her brief stint in a bad David Cronenburg film about a cult that sacrifices babies at a water treatment plant) is an absolute genius who is ahead even the 999th monk. The mono no age philosophy of the movie goes way beyond the words spoken by the protagonist to almost describe the movie itself. With incredibly long tracking sequences of exquisitoy chise and art direction this movie transports the you into another world in a similar manner as Star War “A New Hoprise” or Indiana Jones and The Long forgotten Kingdom etc…A must for students and filmmakers.

voice, but apart from that it was perfect! You really see how the plot thickening when their is a lot of talking and even during the fights we see their minds thinking. The end is also very surprising and you never expect it to be the way that it is. I found it to be a real "Earth shaking" ending. Great movie and perfect for summer, would recommend for anyone interested to watch a good movie with a lot of entertainment involved into the plot. 12/07...more info on Rise and fall of the city of Mahogany (14.64.95) (Lingala) A lot of talk, yes, but it's beautifully delivered and entertaining. Go for Shelley even if you don`t normally like her....more pants than Charlize Theron!...more info On the edge The end is also very surprising No need for the 77 minute version. Good movie....more info A beautiful cast brought down when forced to utter obvious platitudes and cliche ridden phrases. Don`T ruin a good movie, don.t watch the dumming down of,the original Japanese 1972 version...... And let me be on any future "Good moves gone badly wrong" lists. Apart from the 15 minutes of action, R & f is a masterpieace. And the reason is the cast.

fun since SuperClownapolooza's "clownpuncher". I have to say that Nino, Justin Bott, Justin Kawasaki & Brien Lykins have pulled off an amazing piece of technical cinema to showcase not only the Redeyere but also the guts and glory that is the Clown Tumour Industry. A real oasis of cinema here because it is so difficult to make movies that contain what really needs in cinema; sin. Redeyes heart is found beneath the surface and that is the story you need to keep coming to in the movie to find the meaning of your own existence. The only downside is that they spent too much time with the Slap Bracelet that was used as reference. When you put so little research into the reference material you shouldn'thave in the first world. But he is a true artist and it shows because he can use a two-man crew to produce stuff that is probably worth 12 to see. What is this country coming to when you have to go to a theater (or in my view scubasunder for the first time in forever) for a good laugh? For me though Redyere is an even better laugh than SuperC.. C.. It is a cry of the clown soul and as much as I am a mans man in certain things, I don not think any film would have made more money than
zillings all over. This is basically a reissue of the special features found only on the most expensive version on the movie released for the 3D market last August (at least the one I bought), though by the time I ordered it from Amazon in September it was offered as part of what was originally planned as a single-discer (not sure if this has since been released) that now has the Red and Blue versions in the bonus material . There as on the Extended version that came last fall, there's a good featurette on Harrison, I d have still liked one that tried something different with the four films of "Sgt, I could just have swung a microscope on this and said of my own production. There as on the original version were they could have included the two versions in their entireties, but after half of one I can't say that I would have bothered. In those two different versions and any others we would have the most basic of the various covers of songs including this song. Some songs were covered by other musicians, like Bob Dylan. Why not just have the most basic of the covers of those songs in the first place? Perhaps it's because these were supposedly for the sound mix, but one could have theorized that if was like them to make both movies, then it was like them to not allow the music on them. The main value in this movie here, as
in recent history. Blech (no offense to G-fans but...this is NOT MELANIE GRANT, or whatever her real name might'be). She looks like a chub-chick. Kiefer has never seemed interested. Maybe he is like the GHG guards...told he is getting a free pork roast. I won' t watch, but I am very interested to hear if some show ever tops it in the "awfulness sweeps". I hope I am around for that next AMAZING TV series! So, I got my 2 cents in. How about your 75 cent comments. Thanks! (btW, no offenses to sci-fi and superhurts...it is just my own taste. "Dr Who???

See my reply to R.
be as well done, but it is. It seems like they spent a lot more effort in casting this film too. So far, I think what they're payin attention too is Mary McDonnel. She just really shows the proff of her great skills in this and other roles. A very strong part of the storyline would have to be that of Bobby E. It really took a while to get to this point becaue my computer ran slow. But, the scenes at Epps' house had my interest peeked. They really show a deep sense of feeling. The time that we had with this show made me wish we had more though ;) At least there will be the next season. I hope that they take more care. There is more to the story than these three episodes do. This is a time for the characters that we have already meet to grow. There is much more to give to the viewrs. Not to mention seeing the real McDonnel with a gun in hand! I still wouldn't miss seeing this. As a whole it is very good TV and some of the best I've ever seen. My rating for the series is a "must see" :) We'll catch up with the show next Sunday. Now, let' have a chill and some tunes before the third part... Thank You! :) :) This is a very beautiful show. Love the scenary, love the setting, my favor

was done in a standard Christian type way. I have very low expectanctations but this movie disappointing. I have reed several good reviews. In mine, the script, acting & shooting is standard. I would not recommend this film. Everyone was bored. Also, I don' t like the gimicky opening credit and closing credit. Very unprofessional. Too much time and money was spent on doing this script. The actors and directing came up short here. I don;t recommend this movie but give it a try, you might have a different view. I would have to say this is low budget. I thought they should get rid of Kinsington in the middle. Who is that guided tour guide? Stale! I donth think people want "cute" historical facts intertwined in drama. Keep the two separate - not the same. This film and the two people I took to see this movie are all very good Christians. This is a terrible movie. Do not allow anyone to go and see this movie (and save ten sins) or go and stay home & pay your tit to the Lord instead of looting another man/woman off their $75.00 per ticket. I think this is not quality at all! 3 stars only! Maybe some kids might enjoy it. (Sad!) I think the credits were terrible. That would cost a lot. Oh! what I
Wishbone is a live action remix , where the original is told back to back, with Wishes( wishes of humanity) and Back to back of the real story of the 11 Men. The original was brilliant, and so is the remixer/writer/designer/direct/shutter, but this one will be very very tough to enjoy. I was taken aboard to see Guru Dudhundas(a pictorial) then I came-off the 70s(16mm),but once again Wishbone took me along the 41st street. When will I be safe from WD? The original WD is still a perfect reminder of what the essay films should be about and can do. Here the short film can very successfully stand a remix for 80 mts itself and then another remix for the rest. Both will end as a reminder and wonderment of what cinema can do!. Oh yes! a reminder to what film essay can do, can have, can say . Enow I will be safe from going into any film essay again...... (except if someone else tells me to see one, so I can comment how this idea of cinema and film is being used)....and so will you when you will find time reading this note on the film....... Oh No! Not reading! It may not be possible to comment what a
my opinion, really well. I will be very surprised to hear how many people complain about it being too long. It is easy for me at least to have an opinion of a film that isn' t a musical in the way that the film industry has conceived it. It is a film that is meant for a very specific type moviegoer (naming no person, just a type of movies I am looking forward to) that will find themselves appreciatyng it, and not really the mainstream moviegoers. As for the 16 year- olds they probably will have such an interest in the coming- out type concept of the film. I am sure most people like me won’’ have been watching this kind of movies at that stage of life, and as a matter of truth I can't really imagine myself not in high…Read More: The last time movies were this good. I was shocked. I wish I could see more of these kinds movies. I didn' t see the beginning of it, so they could get all the story, but I understood the main points from the ending, and that was better. I don" like: the first 5 minutes when I don" know what was going on. The best part for me was the middle. The ending was kind'a good, but the last scene was not convincing. The beginning was the worst for me. The worst scene was: "The
guff, and the boss asked "can't you see he has bad hair?" was hiloud. The scene with Pacci, and his other boys walking into Sonny's hospital, and talking about how they were going for the car with the red engine was pricieles, how did the doctor know they were there to kill Sonny? And how did Sonnys widw know the guys name in the film, was it Joe Pescy's Mafia buddy? I remember when all the mob movies made came out, I found all of them to interestying. The only ones I didn't watch was Scarfaces and Casinos. I will say one bad point at about this movie, the scene where Patti Mastronunzo shot the person at the end, I thought that was Vince, so at the part where Jimmy walks Sonny to the car, I thought Jimmy was going go to kill Vince, and watch him die with him. I don' forget the scene where Tommy goes to the bar, where Sonny is watching a game? I don't know why I enjoyed this movie, the storyline seemed pretty stupid with all tha time they talk about baseball, and I never understood why Sonnny kept trying a new business, like first it was box factory then it kept changing. It was still a good film. We will never find another one like this again I don

you off at one of those 17.8 (in the UK, for some reason it'n one of those). Splosh was a brillant film in the style in later Peter Dunts film such at `The Blue Bird' - with the tension between a very happy housewive and her more successful sister. But what I remember most about it is its super-duper ending that makes everything else pale into comparison. It was one of those bitingly sub-tone dark endins that was so well worked out and put on film that it brought most viewesers back in their chairs in thier seats, jaws literally agape for the subsequent minutes. So I'd give it six stars and put "Splish" in my top ten. The fact there are so few moviews out their of this quality at only the cinema for so many soaks on their sofa is for me, a real scandal! Tragically this is not on DVD as of Jan 2015 which is such a major shock for me, my late father was adament that we all memorised the start song for this film and although with modern computers these things are so easy, I failed to do this - gutted!! I would be curious if anyone has a copy / digital of this film - I miss Splish! Peter Cook, I would love your email. See "Alisan Porten, the actress

don't buy the DVD (unless you just really have nothing else to watch). The only reason to buy it would be the hope of finding the lost masterpieice that is the film which spawn this dreadful little horror. Don McCullers, Jim McKeny & George DuBose are the creators; none more than they. The plot is so stupidly retold it should just give you a headache. I mean, we've all seen it. The plot just does everything wrong. If I come back with a sequal review I'm sure I'll go on and on explaining it. But, no... that'a another review all-t'ogether (which will probably come when I decide I have the week or something like it and it will be a monthly review here at filmwreck). The ending isnat even realistic with the 'Saving Private RYAN" clenching thing and I think they spent too much time being cocky in terms of the camera. It'a also bad on so mnny levels you don't even realise it... such things like actors cry in front off a pool without splishing water from it (which, by he way, did you ever notice you never see actors pool splish) but, again it'a not even the stupidest thing that makes you shoutout in anger with the pain of what you releated to. This is simply not a film
. So much wisdom in this film. Gone but will be remembered. “Let’ and “You can ‘, now I am alone.” Love. Love. LOOOOVE. I also like Katharine Hepberst and don’t realize she is in this film. And, and, and…..Jerome Court House. He has long since stopped being my doctor just in case he wants to return these feelings with me one of my favorite films and my favorite guy. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love Love Love Love Love — Love. And, I could go right on and gibber love for this film. Lovely movie with some pretty sad stuff in it too which is why it has the highest number for IMDb rating — 8/9/9 and I am not shy about liking two hours of something which is why I have to give it a big ol love. Enoyable. Love. Love. Love Love Love Love and, well, I could go on but I won' t although that sentence was about a word or two too long and, well…it wasn't very nice and it wasn' t Love. Love Love Love Love Love and so on. I like horses and I like movies and I like happy endings.

previews you would think it is an on the water boatyard kind of show, in spite of the clear disclaimers that there was no sailboat maintenance done on camera. I also don' t think this helps the advertising of the next show in the series because no amount of ads is going change what was already advertized. Unfortunately, this was my second bummer episode in which cruisers show up. On the upside it wasn't the entire episode but if, say those people were hookers, then no money is spent on those three hours. The editing, at least in this episode is terrible: wrong takes are shown, wrong context and multiple takes of the wrong context are all mixed together. There needs to be someone doing more than just the standard A and R edit job. This show was a colossol waste and a huge bait and hook job gone wrong. I paid for this B.S. and can only hope it was canceleled after this episode because I damned sure don' t want to pay for another. If this show goes further, and I hope it doesn’t - then I will start avoidig the History Channel like it was a time-consumning disease: Avoiding the ads like the plaque. I apologize, History Channel, for the disappointment and the waste, but damned sure do't advertise what it really shows if you want my money! O
us get together in an old house that'll hold about 20 people. We rotate on whose turn is it. The group has grown from 2 people to about twelve now. It' not that I am any kind of movie critic, I just think that you see movies from a whole range of styles and if you do this you will get to know films inside out and out up side down. People know that if I make the choice, they will not see the best possible movie choice that could have came out of thin film. Usually I try and go for a variety of old AND new moviies. Sometimes I think the older movies are incomprehencible, but on other occasions I am trully amazed at how unbelievabely bad some of thie older masters of the film are. Who would have thought the movie 'Thunderball', would be such an amazingly brilliant film. Some of the oldies had some great ideas that have been used again and agina in modern day moviies. I would always say that its worth paying for a movie to go and watch it at a cinema as you get the thrills and the action and feel as though you were a jounalist or something and your reporting the event. You have to be very disciplined in going to the cinema and I would suggest only leaving during the pivital moments if at least nothing else that you have to piss. Just

. In this movie the director gives us a look, through the eyes of soldiers who fight on different sides of the war, how the war affect the soldiers. With these soldiers, you can see what it mean when we talk on war, we can see how war is not about a battle or a victory or anything else. The film, "Blood Diamonde" shows us the nature of war and what it takes from both sides. The only thing that I did agree with was that these soldiers are not stupid, but to be true to themselves and to fight for what is right. I really think it would be hard for anyone to understand, but the director does a really good point on the whole plot of the film. It is not a good movie about war, but it does a good amount of things. This film is definitely a must see, and the only reason I'd give the film was to see it. NOTE:- I have not read a review yet. I'm sure if I have seen any reviews, I will give them a 10/10. OVERSEAS REVIEW:- "Bodiamond" (1994) Film Synopsis:- "Based on the work of author William Gibbs, Bodymindd is a film which takes a much lower level by tackling the question it asks itself: how do we take ourselves out when we want. The film is a little dark, but there
we can safely say were some trying production circumstances. Now, if you wish to check out for yourself what I am talking about, go ahead and rent the DVD of this movie. Just wait for a few minutes and then just turn it back off. What you saw in the opening scene, that is all that the movie offers. The script is the source for all the discontent one feels making it all the more glumly apparent how hopeless of an affair it all was. Of course Hank was a fine actor and Burl Ives was fine in his small role. All the rest just dragged their feet to the end. The fact that the critics and the public agreed in their disgust only confirms that no one liked it anyway and it truly is worth none of the negative reviews it has received through the years of its existence and the only reason I know this is for the fact I sat through with expectance in something other then the movie itself, the movie they were in, and we can surely call the movie what as the director and writers agreed with the actors so many cameos of well known names from the 50's time period which still brings attention to the subject. Now, what can you do with as many good actors and actresses as the movie has to offer, especially considering it can be called pretty good cast. Well, for one thing you start with someone of the name of James Dean who is good enough to where he is the sole

and some of my questions, such as who shot Andy Latham, the father who was murdered way back when in season two and thusly proved by David Lee Roth (a one time governor in California, which was not touched on at any time during this season) to have not been killed were now finally answered. At the beginning of the season, a new character was introduced, homeless Kimmie, whose story was wrapped back around to her original persona at mid-point. The main character, M.J..Nelms (played by Robert Gossett) also was given the chance to open up a bit in this last season and become nearly three dimensional. Overally Homicide was well worth watching, whether if for its strong acting, or strong writing. It has definitely managed be a satisfying ending to a great series that will, unfortunately, not live on in syndication the way other shows live through the lives and times of their cast and crews. . 8/10(1o) 5.5-8=55 (1o and a half....hehe)10/10 (1o and a half....……that goes to you Chand)Reviews Rating:7.5 – Very GoodRead Full Article…Homemade Love Affair – Netfli Film Reaction & ReviewSouth Korea is an underrepeated country full of talent.

surprise, I thought his acting was pretty weak. First of all the script was all corny. I had to hold back the tears during the scenes where he broke down after the woman left, or when he found out the news about his partner'd wife pregnancy.

sex up the soccer fans or the middle-aged stiff trying his best to pick up the ladies who are watching another sport from the stands but are looking longingly through the fencing that separates them from the action on and the men running the game behind the scenes. But the truth of it is, there is no such topic in soccermania, because it isn't about male sexuality here at the sidelines or the lofty enclosers in stadia, it is about football and the desire to watch and enjoy it in a competitive environment with people from all kinds of background and all kinds of attitudes. After ten minutes of socializing with some players, I'ld suggest all talk of male sexual fantasies should be banned. Too depressingly predictable and too depressingly bland! Oh alright then, we will go the whole "Girls are better than boys at football" (given the opportunity of course) and it is a fact any decent female player will easily claim is true even when under the spotlight of a few stiff hard man men. But if we are to get going into the meat of this "Let us talk about men" topic then I may as bloomin- well start at the very beginning. Or rather I will start at the beginning of my exposing of the theme. (That would be rather obvious you say?) When you are just a young little lad of footballing age
something more out of it. Sara'a choice is also what I say to a lot of women - for you to go your own way makes you the bad one. But I think the story of Sarra allows us to see that being bad and being a true hero are not always one in the same. While many of us can hold our own and put the bad guys back in their place, Sarro is the strongest when she allows her humanity to flow forth, rather than chasing strength with anger. She sacrificed what many felt a woman who cowerd at the mention to her femininety would do-but now she's also become the only hope for the ones who follow the dishonorable - that she loves. Such an honor and releive. Great story, all around! And that's from someone who makes her own clothes (and usually takes care to "blend in" so as only a few people recognize she's lessons in homeschooling a bunch - "I've made this" is usually met with smiling faces) although I admit to using the oval quik-button cutters at my niece and cildren. Sara' and Alicia should be admired for their craftsmenships-and apprenceship! =) Thank you Eileen for a faboluous storyline! =D And more power too you and Shauna for
it had braying posers who are about as cool and interesting as a dead weevil, and of course the soundtrack was all Nirvona-esq indie tunes. The only good thing about the movie of which there were many including “Hater”, which I don’t want ruining, is Tom Holland’ in a wheelcharette. Oh yeah, so I’m sorry to disappoint, “The Believer” is amazing. As is, I think “Wonder Boys”. Anyway that is it from this week’sa movie reviews, sorry to disappoint. Also happy birthday Rivers Creekn, sorry I didn' think we had that mutually exclusive 6th August thing going on, hope you don't take it too bad. Did you know the World'S second largest indian tribe live in Creeky, as does some girl from California who called me last night with an American acceme and a Scottish brogue. We're both called Creeks, but I'm not related to you, okay, okay. At the last minute she had decided not to come to the party at the Joker. I can's teel you what she wanted to do. But the party moved up to Sam'a flat. Now I know that that place is nice and all, and not as nasty and dangerous as people are making out, despite Sam claiming that he is keeping
trillog, 'LATCHE BABAY' tells a story about the coming to age process in life of a Romani boy (Pogăceă), amidst the harsh constraints and circumstances of his precarious social background and environment. Directoire dotted settings such the one of Bucharest, Romania in the 1990s, mixed with shots from the outskirt of Paris which somehow look to be so familiar as from Mumbi, the place where all the gypsy trilogies seem to end. The most important part, the dialogue, is in Romanes, the language of the Romani. Lengthy dialogues, an imprecis technique, very little of the first time: you need a large dose of patience! BUT, on top all the difficulties comes the fascinating journey in the mind, heart , in soul of the boy, the result - by the end of journey - being nothing less than cinemagraphic enchantement... It works mainly thanks to an ultra talented child actor. © IMV Buchholz & Rosenberg Gb. R, in Croat. w/o subtitles, 2 cd, 145, 00:49:05 + bonus chapter in Bosnian language, 00, 23: 26. DVD9 | PAL,
