 One generation leaves generationally speaking....<br /><br />So basically something based mostly upon political theory rather less based purely economic theory<br /><br />> less  No economic theory involved!<br /><br />Well shit   Just thought i'd throw something else onto political theory  Thanks<br /><br />Yip!

 Kodiako<br /><br />Because apparently GenV doesn t fit together perfectly<br /><br />That didn´ t answer<br /><br />Well... GenV isn t exactly linear story... So having same storyline across games isn´ t something easy...<br /><br />Well... So far gen iv doesnt fit together perfectly either...<br /><br />Actually... GenV does... Since GenV took story events literally ver ver close... Even though... GenV never came...<br /><br />Well... Not exactly... If i remember correctly... One guy didnt liked gen iv<br /><br />Well... Yeah.. Only ONE person...  Anyway.. GenV won´T come... Not until something goes wrong..<br /><br />Well yes yes... Maybe gen vi<br /><br />Nah.. GenVI already happened too...   Gen VI took events straight...   So Gen VI won´ t happen...  Also... GenVI wont ever happen...<br /><br />If i remember coreily correct... There wont ever come gen viii<br /><br />GenViii already happend... You mean GenVI?? XD<br /><br />Ok... yeah... i dont remember too correctly... GenVII i believe... That never happend<br /><br />No.. GenVVII happend... You mean GenV???  Anyway... You´ll hear GenVVII soon...  Anyway.. That wont happen too....<br /><br />You sure... You didnt play genVVII  Also i never heard genVII...  Well... You´ve probably heard genVI...<br /><br />*smacks forehead* ...  Well.. Sorry...  Anyway.... Why cant GenV come

 Matrix style editing!   No thanks...<br /><br />Yes....because changing characters names really changes anything.....<br /><br />This isn´ t Matrix style editing...it doesn` t give creditability either....what´ mr sean carman thinks happens behind    closed doors...   If someone didn ` ta tell u,they probably aren ` ta telling u truth...   So yes, changing characters names alters everything....but changing actors  makes nothing better..it makes everything look childish...it turns something important    upside      ,into something    insignificant....  Edit : spelling<br /><br />What actors though??<br /><br />John Goodman..<br /><br />Who changed??<br /><br />What characters?<br /><br />Who wrote?<br /><br />When u type..<br /><br />When u edit...<br /><br />Where u live?? Which house?? Who owns   What cars? Who drives  What food? If something goes missing..what replaces? Where does  u live?? Who takes care??<br /><br />That scene actually makes sense though!!<br /><br />You mean     > You           > You  >   Are crazy  >   Are  > Crazy   >   You   Are  >   crazy  That scene makes sense?      There`  scene isn` t necessary...   All movie directors  change actors ,   every single  major,    important   shot  change

warship earth+the old man&the sea(great book!!).But endsup failing both times<br /><br /><br /><br />If anything..its nice getting something else besides star trek movies once ive caught windof something different..and something original..(for instance).My problem(and i imagine others too!)with star Trek..(or trek related movies!!..its kinda repetitive!!!..and i feel bored..when i watch star trek..even thought ive watched every movie..and own alot..but i feel uninspired..its why im waiting until 2009...for something else<br /><br /><br /><br />If anything..its nice<br /><br /><br /><br />Get Star Trek V! That film didn\'ts fail...it succeeded! Its almost exactly why Trek fans love original films...there\' re different storylines...even set ups..and characters...and plot..and themes..and locations! Even plot devices!<br /><br /><br /><br />If anything..its nice<br /><br />Well..its nice..its nice!<br /><br /><br /><br />You haven\' t tried something else yet Star trek V isn\'ts bad..it doesn&#39';ts seem perfect..but nothing else ever does! Its original..its great! Its why i love star wars too...it breaks away..not exactly..from star wars too..because star wars started everything..theres nothing wrong either...but alot wrong too!! Plus..it adds alot!..(even though star wars started everything..its nice..it gets away!)...its nice!...<br /><br /><br /><br />If

Frankenstein lives!, Meg Ryancamp s debut comedy starring Robert De niro s daughter, offers nothing particularly insightful aside frumpiness. Instead Ryan s quirky turn makes things laughably funnily amusing. Director Mike Nichols might regret spending money, given Ryan re s knackto provide cheap glee, without providing anything really worthwhile, especially once De Nero s character realizes Frankenstein s creator s own evil twin, played dour sardine John Malkovich, isn t dead, leaving De niro mumbling. When De Nero s Frankenstein character meets Frankenstein himself -- playedby Adam West --we find ourselves saying things along thta line, often wondering why De delrio didn t bother making himself appear older --at least 50 --givenhis own age. Other elements include amusing side characters whomDe delroy takes lightly, though never failsto remind readers Frankenstein isn ve come close tobesemaking funny. Even without providing anything particularly smartly funnyyou ll

    Bad idea  Good execution  Bad rating     Good idea  Good execution  OK rating(meager budget  average direction  average specialeffects  ok writing  horrible acting  bad rating    Bad execution<br /><br />Agonized    >Bad idea Good execution Bad rating   Well...that sums pretty nicely why movies generally score better nowadays...<br /><br />Himachal Express wasnot bad idea,but execution wasnot really done.  If movie score 90 percentile,it deserves decent production quality,acting quality,specialeffects,directions,etc.  If movie scores 80 percentile ,its OK.  Average production,decent acting,bad direction,bad specialeffects,worst acting,low production quality,worst writing,poor performance,so bad,<br /><br />No idea....but agree entirely....and yet....there seem fewer movies doing average budget...but perhaps....there won too few movies overall....or maybe...people simply dont watch enough movies...<br /><br />Well,people mostly buy dvd,mobile,tablets,   pc etc....and thats mostly why   Most movies score low,but average quality<br /><br />Lol   No wonder..my god...it seems almost everyone seems stuck watching shows....and movies....and whatever else....on phones....crappiest shit ever designed!!!!!!<br /><br />So,what i m looking,is low production quality movies,with average rating,but average production quality,and average ratings,but

)) One thing though! One mistake.. If im remembering correct.. Its NOT Disney!<br /><br /><br /><br />They used footage already used once!!!<br /><br />This Movie really deserves alot better treatment<br /><br /><br /><br />That sounds really silly...but true...<br /><br /><br /><br />But i loved every minute i didnt really mind watching things i never saw..<br /><br />Now i dont look anymore...<br /><br />But thanks anyway..it sure helps<br /><br />Btw i looked again..its actually Disney!<br /><br />Yippee!<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh...yeah! You totally found Disney!<br /><br />You better watch Disney! That movie isn´ t Disney!<br /><br />Disney movies usually come along wich scenes look better! You´ re probably watching something else!<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />http://www4u4moviehome4u!images4download!9c98daac4b9cf9760b77ac57c897b!<br /><br /><br /><br />Haha...no..that really WAS Disney...it wasnot Disney...but yeah...thereis alotof stuff mixed together..which looks pretty bad..<br /><br />but i really liked every moment i watched...<br /><br /><br /><br />Ok...but Disney didnt use everything..just every scene! Disney used footage ALREADYPASSED BY DISNEY! Which doesnt really bother...<br /><br />But yeah..the film itself...well..it doesnt deserve anything..so far!<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh..yes..you found DISNEY!<br /><br />That movie looks terrible! That really WAS DISney<br /><br />No...it doesn´ t look better
 Cobra Commander<br /><br />What makes Cobra commander better suited? Do note i dont mean power wise, thats already established. What i wanna hear here. Is,why does hivor pick Cobra Commander... i mean... i thought hivors character development took place     post   9  .<br /><br />There isnot really enough reason given...and honestly nothing else really jumps immediately...<br /><br />Okay, thank i am gonna watch silence anyway.<br /><br />Please try Silence! Its worth every dime<br /><br />But i am watching      Cobra command...  i am rewatching.  So basically, i mean i havent watched silence yet...    Im currently watching  MASH...<br /><br />Ah! Well dont worry :)    What happens later though really depends...<br /><br />Okay.  You got nay idea why hivor pick cobra command,   i mean, i didnt find ANYTHING different , hivor picks katara, cuz katana...<br /><br />Hivors character development happens post 9<br /><br />Okay. Thanks ill watch     silence soon   Edit : Also i am watching       Cobra kata...   Cobra kata...is based    On   Silent hill... i find kata kinda cool, cause katana...  Im currently thinking whether kara fight hIVor again...   So ill watch silence later.  Cheery :)<br /><br />Good luck :D<br /><br />

Thankyou....<br /><br /><br /><br />Hi<br /><br />What Pavimooiiii means depends upon whether<br /><br />its possessive form means Pompeium, epeutial city,<br /><br />rather Pompeivium, city. Perhaps, Pompeii<br /><br />could mean Pompeii epeucialis<br /><br />which might explain why students havenííò notice....<br /><br />Pompeuvoeis<br /><br />might mean Pompeii epeutiaeis,<br /><br />where Pompeii eepueutiaeus might mean<br /><br />Pom

        So lets look here...  First.. why does water flowing slowly matter here.. surely water flowing really slow isn´ t enough power generation  Second.. why isnâ t water powering generators used elsewhere anyway..     Third.. why isnâ t dam´  power generation used somewhere else..  &quot..<br /><br />If water flows slow enough...then pumps run slower meaning plants arenââ&#1323;;   ...more efficient<br /><br />Exactly -- water flowing slower produces better results -- thus pumps run slower means less power generation!<br /><br />Or less water means better energy production due less friction losses...<br /><br />Exactly! Less energy generation = lower efficiency = lower power production! Hence why pumping must slow -- less friction = greater power creation = greater water pumping!  You really must learn simple stuff!  &#x200B;"<br /><br />Pump run speed > power consumption speed     Not pump run length > power generation speed     Simple concepts really<br /><br />Really...?  No... thats  simply wrong...  &#X2061;"If water moves faster....then water pumps move faster making power output higher...if water flows fast....it moves faster pumping water..."    --- water moves faster == pump run speed!= power consumption speed  --- water flows fast == pump output = power output speed  --- pumps run faster == water pumping == power production speed = pump production rate!<br /><br />Pump run length > pump

 Otherwise skip!"   You'd almost wonder...if someone really thought *that*!   Then again maybe someone saw *that* reviewer watching something else...<br /><br />That dude literally posted pictures holding tickets saying   #HATE THE TITANS     #LOATHE BATMAN KNIGHT OF THE OLD ORDER     #LOATHE BATMAN V GOTHam  Seriously...     So disappointed<br /><br />That post got removed due too profanity lol<br /><br />Well.. You gotta give credit though.. That dude actually showed passion lol<br /><br />He didnning something stupid isn´´the same though!<br /><br />Well.. Its definitely better...<br /><br />No     All i read   Was something negative  About fanservices      Fanservice  Is everywhere   Not everything else<br /><br />Well... You gotta admit.... That comment sounded pretty interesting!    That review...   That review...<br /><br />So...the thing  Is  That  That specific fan  Is pretty    Unique<br /><br />If true... That sounds... Like something... Interesting    About  What  Might happen    If...    Zack Snyder  Directes... That... Movie!  *shakes head thinking    That... Sounds pretty interesting   Not sure though<br /><br />Yeah   Some kind..  Not really sure...Of fan service happening...  That movie does sound... Pretty cool  So Zack Snyder
<br /><br />Nah Linux Mint<br /><br />But mint relies largely upon debian packages...  Also both linux mareks seem extremely bare...<br /><br />If Debian isn´n enough Debian packages... How does Gentoom run?<br /><br />GentOO runs GentOO....it isn´nt bare...<br /><br />Just look closely enough... You´ll find Gentoom isn´n actually Linux...  Gentoom distro  Is actually Linux   Gentroom  distros  Are really GNU   Linux Mint      Linux          Mint<br /><br />Yeah man Mint does suck ass compared    To Mint    Edit autocorrect fix<br /><br />If Mint suck worse.. How does Gentroom sucks ass?    So Mint sucks less ? Or Mint sucks equal ?   Or Mint sucks ass less?  If Gentoon sucks less    Then why does Gentoo sucking suck? Does Gentoo sucks ass less? Or does Gentoo sucking suck less ass?  If Gentwoob sucks ass  less   Then why does Gentoom sucks ass?  Does Gentoom sucks less ass? Or does Gentoom sucks less ass shit<br /><br />> If Gentoom suck less shit  > If Gentoom sucking suck suckless  >  > Or Gentoom fucking sucks less shit ass ass  >  >  > Does /u/-jazzman suck ass less shit ass ass ass    >  > Or does /u/_

 Davies & Sons & Middendorfe & Stellhorn & others etc etc etc etc…<br /><br />My question must therefore lie : How does Shakespeare achieve success both technically & practically? Is Shakespeare technically sound…or must Shakespeare simply find clever ways without actually taking too great risks…like Davies….however Davies succeeded despite Shakespeare….how?<br /><br /><br /><br />In answer…perhaps Davies & Co managed duelling ships & Middy probably went full speed & full steam ahead…without actually having gone far ahead….but…did Shakespeare ever actually use anything beyond cannon & maybe gunpowder & maybe cannon…& gun powder… & gunpowder… & Gun Powder?<br /><br />Or : Perhaps Davies et co used & abused cannon….showing Shakespeare perhaps Shakespeare didnot actually use & exploit cannon….so….who wins?<br /><br /><br /><br />On reflection…yes… Shakespeare must find clever means & ways… & possibly exploit clever means…but Shakespeare himself must find clever means & uses….<br /><br /><br /><br />This brings forth another interesting question : Is Shakespeare technically superior…or simply better tactically…or perhaps does Shakespeare always find clever means & uses….so perhaps technically…as Shakespeare himself…is always technically competent…or simply does Shakespeare always use clever meanes & methods [which might imply technically proficiency?] …<br /><br /><br /><br />Or…the answer might lie elsewhere….<br /><br /><br /><br />[As Shakespeare himself might point…<br /><br /><br /><br />All successful works find technical means & methods…<br /><br />Including Davies…& Stelly…& Shakespeare…& Davies….& St

 Charlie Chan running across chinese rooftop looking terrified whilst Laurel & Hardys laugh along side each others sillier antics...but ultimately Hardies comedy seems forced & artificial whilst Laurel & Hardies comedy seems quite natural & spontaneous...this doesn t necessarily mean Hardy & Hardy couldn ; however,it shows Charlie Chan s films often fall victim too forced comedy. Hardy & Laurel films always seem spontaneous,natural. One must remember,while comedy does play roles,the actual content plays equal parts. Here,one sees Hardy,with something less akin too Charlie Chavers style,rather something akin too BusterKeaton comedy,with Charlie Chavers style<br /><br /><br /><br />No comments<br /><br />on<br /><br />Hardys First Trip To China<br /><br /><br /><br />There appear too few videos relating<br /><br />to Hardys<br /><br />First<br /><br />Trips To<br /><br />ChINA,<br /><br />either.

 Generation X!<br /><br />What does GenX mean?<br /><br />Generations used interchangeablyly referring generatioins ranging anywhere anywhere 20ish~65ish<br /><br />Well thanks! How does everyone here define generational stuff?<br /><br />There isn´ t anything definitive here man haha<br /><br />Fair enough! How exactly  come Generation Z fits?<br /><br />Gen Z doesn` t fit really, i guess cause social media started getting mainstream.         Generation Z includes teens, kids, young adults..  i guess<br /><br />Oh ok, cool. Where am i supposed fit? Cause i didn´ mean Gen Z haha, sorry!   So Generation Z might fit somewhere near 30<br /><br />Well i never really found Gen Z really defined myself i guess, idk why.  Gen Y though  probably? haha  cause kids born within 1996 ?<br /><br />Ah ok,   So maybe i´ fall somewhere near Generation Y haha   Thanks!<br /><br />Yeah man, Gen Z might fit somewhere   maybe 30? Or something. Im probably wrong though, Gen X might actually define generation lol.    What exactly does Gen Y define?<br /><br />Maybe something along lines along   Young   Technology  Fast food food    Cars  Video gamedes      Not really sure tho haha<br /><br />Yeah i thought technology too, i guess. Not sure really though lol.<br /><br />Yeah maybe ? Who else fits Gen Y though<br /><br />Idk, im sure someone else might

disney movies seem pretty boring<br /><br />Pixar actually does CGI better...  Pixar movies aren´ t boring too, Toy story & Monsters inc.....<br /><br />No Pixar films look primitive today, maybe compared  old Disney animated classics,  Monsters,  Inc,  & Toy,  Story look almost art movie quality compared today<br /><br />Cars?<br /><br />Still looks better CGI wise & production value wise, compared  Cars 2012,  Cars 2008, Transformers,  Cars, & Monsters Inc   You  probably wouldn` t find Cars 2015 anywhere near Pixar, Cars 2002  maybe  compared Cars 2000  &   Cars 2007  &  Cars 2009  & Cars 2014  & Cars 2015  & Cars 2016. Pixar` s CGI quality went downhill     Even Cars 2009 looked better<br /><br />If Cars 2009 looked anything close CGI wise today.. i wouldn´ t believe..  Cars 2014 looks great i agree, cars 2006 looked terrible though<br /><br />Cant tell , u might  disagree.  Cars 2009   &   Cars 2016, i mean Cars 2010 & Cars 2008  look pretty primitive CGI,  Cars 1986,  & Cars 2006 look pretty primitive compared Cars 2003, Cars 2003 vs Tomorrowland , Cars 2007   vs   Cars 2009,  Monsters vs Aliens vs Terminator , Cars 2001 vs Cars 2005 vs Cars 2005 Cars 2006 vs  Cars 2009 Cars 2010 vs Cars 2014 Cars 2016 looks nothing    better   Than Cars 2009 &

 Drawing inspiration almost entirely form teen films,as opposed totwo teen flicks,andthe classic teen romance filmthat featured Tom Hanks ;).<br /><br /><br /><br />Hank Azaria plays David Levinson : Part owner warden,part manager,part manger. Davidisthe boss,he hires staff.<br /><br /><br /><br />He starts dating Rebecca Solis. Who plays Jane : One half owner wench. She gets romanced,she gets let run wild. Then,she gets fired ; ).<br /><br /><br /><br />What follows afterwards : Lots,and Lots o(pun ) sexual banter. There seems little effort behind writing something funny though,which makes things feel stale. You realise pretty early,that alot fo lines havn(have ) zero comedic intance. You feel rather cheated tp find yourself laughing o(being entertained ),when things seemed meanttomakeyou laugh,but haev(havehave ) nothing funny o(being amusing )going.<br /><br />This becomes especially disappointing bcs,thereare moments likethere,which might come fairly close.<br /><br /><br /><br />Rebecca soles : Forgot abouthis girl friend,whole scene wich starts :<br /><br />'' Oh hey babe!''<br /><br /><br /><br />Is played extremely straighforward. Thereis absolutely zero attempt( effort?) To create anything amusing beyondthat. Even worse : There issuppose(supposeto ) sbe,that both love each others,and thay both bfying. Yet,thereis zero effort

 art does little harm -- though Byron went crazy anyway -- art makes little progress toward perfection -- Though Lord knows!<br /><br /><br /><br />In Byron` s era poetry itself -- both religious devotionals sung ad nauseamand popular music -- became increasingly mechanical.<br /><br /><br /><br />Today poetry -- though increasingly individualized -- becomes increasingly predictable -- especially given advances inthe art form itself<br /><br />which allow almost anyone -- anywhere --to write poetry -- anywhere --<br /><br />with almost anything<br /><br /><br /><br />And thus art -- whether poetryor music-- loses something vital<br /><br />whenthey become mechanical --<br /><br /><br /><br />And Byron` s art lostits sense --and lostits spirit. His poetry -- too mechanical -- lostnot enough meaning --<br /><br /><br /><br />and too abstractto connect<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br /><br />which perhaps explains<br /><br />some -- perhaps too little<br /><br />--of Byron ` t<br /><br /><br /><br />love --<br /><br />that strange obsession --<br /><br />that love --<br /><br /><br /><br />which drove Byron mad --<br /><br />and ultimately ruinedhim<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br /><br />When Byron returnedfrom Greece --he spent several days visiting friends --<br /><br />and laterwrote --<br /><br /><br /><br />And every man thinks --<br /><br /><br /><br />In times gone past man --<br /><br /><br /><br />Didstill --notonlydid staid<br /><br /><br /><br />But man today --has found<br /><br />that life --<br /><br /><br /><br />has found --<br /><br /><br /><br />That man today --<br /><br /><br /><br />can --find --the<br /><br /><br /><br />light --that --<br /><br />lives below<br /><br /><br /><br />Above<br /><br /><br /><br />Underneath --insideAnd<br /><br />outside<br /><br /><br /><br />And man today --<br /><br /><br /><br />dwellesthere --

Just saying thats why Starwag games dont count ;)  Starwars games arnt Starwags movies...<br /><br />So basically movies aren´T StarWags games anymore...  Or....  StarHogs games arenT StarWars...   StarWags games aren`T StarWars StarWars games...<br /><br />That logic doesn` really checkout...  Star Wars isnr Starwar...Star Wars=StarWarGames...and GameStar<br /><br />Yeah...  StarWars movies aren´T StarWaggames either....<br /><br />StarWars movies aren´Ts StarWagargames.....  Or...  StarWars movies arenTs StWarWars games.....  StarHog games arenTs starwag games...          StarHOG games arNT starwag games....  Just stop dude...  You dont win   If movies arnt starwags....  Then movies aren´T starwar games either....<br /><br />Star Wars movies arnt Starwars either

 aka Star Trek Generations seems strange too...<br /><br />Star Trek Generations really doesn´ts hold together too great either.. i guess Generations wasn`T meant too standup<br /><br />What makes Generations less standup compared gto Into darkness :D :D :D<br /><br />Well i haven´T seen Into Darknes yet xd<br /><br />Well Into evilness doesnt sound too bad...<br /><br />XD Yeah.. i guess i won´T complain too bad :p<br /><br />Just thought :D :p :D<br /><br /><br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness seems rather solid compared gto Star Trek Generations... So i guess Generations isn`T *too* bad<br /><br /><br /><br />There´N´T anything terribly bad here... Just enough funny stuff without really doing something spectacular either<br /><br />Something something something something something terrible went quite wrong here ;P<br /><br />This generation seems really lacking though<br /><br /><br /><br />There must´nt really anything here besides maybe humor.. Not everything needs som epic space battle xD :D ;D :D :P<br /><br />Intro Darkness looks alot better tho xP XD<br /><br /><br /><br />There aren�nt anymore special effects here either<br /><br /><br /><br />But i suppose i dont complain too severely here.. xDD<br /><br />Intro darkness seems awesome xd<br /><br /><br /><br />Intro darkness seems quite solid im guessing :DD :DD :DD :DX<br /><br />But im sure Star trek Into darkness seems cool too!XD<br /><br /><br /><br />Intros seem nice enough here too XD :DD :D ;D :DX<br /><br />This generations seems alot nicer here too

Although having taken classes based solely within documentary techniques i find myself agreeing here!

Just best documentary i guess!!!!   Not really sure yet havent got anything checked!<br /><br />Wow! How exciting lol<br /><br />Haha! Im pretty excited!  Have never won anything!!<br /><br />If nothing else helps watching movie reviews<br /><br />Its hard!  My brother does reviews..   Not sure.. i dont read...so.... haha!  Just wish something better came along!!  Or hopefully i win something! Lol<br /><br />Lolol! Keep looking! One movie review comes across doesn´ta count :)<br /><br />Havnet got anything!! Lol!!  Just saw reviews saying....! Lol..!   Just hope something better comes along!!   Wouldnt matter...lol...   Anything else!  Would rather watch documentaries though!

 Illumi & Miyu<br /><br />Yeah Ashura kicksass! One helluvalot better live compared ot youtube videos though...<br /><br />What video quality does ashuras videos usually use??        Just found Ashura videos using.mp4(and wav files). Is Ashura videos quality ok?? If yes... Where i might find.mp4 files??<br /><br />They usually convert YT ones(or whatever youtube converts vids). So probably Youtubers.avi files...  If i remember correct Ashura videos use.mkd files instead.mp4 files(because mkv supports soundtracks). So... You dont wanna convert YT vids...<br /><br />Ahh....mp4 files dont look bad :O  Thanks! Ill start converting YTs videos :P<br /><br />Yup... Shouldnt hurt... Especially YTs.mkds usually use higher bitrates too :P<br /><br />What bitrates does Ashura video used use?:O<br /><br />Oh god... Idfk anymore..  Probably whatever YT uses... So... Whatever bitrates YT uses :D<br /><br />Oops.. Ashuras videos bitrate... Are too small :P  Im gonna convert Ashuras videos...  Thank! :)<br /><br />Oh :O... Ashuras probably doesnt support higher bitratings yet... So Ashuras videos probably dont look too damn bad!<br /><br />Ashuras probably doesnt convert YT videos higher... Ashures videos.. Cant support higher bitrates xD

 1939 film studio films star Robert Montgomery starring Jack Warner, George Raft ; directed By Curtiz.<br /><br />Film summary :<br /><br /><br /><br />From director Michael Ebert, comes Ebert s latest film, starring Charles Braga. As always Brague takes full advantage, making sure Ebert makes look foolish rather thantrying hard.<br /><br />When Brague s fiancée dies young. Brague makes sure never married, living alone.<br /><br />Inspectors keep bugging, trying find evidence, Brague gets tired. One night,<br /><br />he finds himself sitting...<br /><br /><br /><br />Review<br /><br /><br /><br />If Ebert wants Ebert s latest film star Charlie Brown, Brague must agree.<br /><br /><br /><br />Brague s role must always play Brague dons various hats, wearing suits ; looking young, looking old :<br /><br /><br /><br />When Ebert tries using Bruegert s voice, Braga s voice comes across.<br /><br /><br /><br />There s plenty here, Braga, Ebert, Ebert s direction,<br /><br /><br /><br />Charlie Browns acting skills, Brague performance, Brage & Ebers vision... What s left?<br /><br />Just bad acting Eber s direction...<br /><br />And poor direction.<br /><br /><br /><br />Charlie does, yes Brague, Braga, yes Ebbets direction...<br /><br /><br /><br />As expected here, Charlie Brown goes far enough, taking Ebert s style, using<br /><br />Brague s voice, yes. Asking Charlie Brown things.<br /><br />Ebers direction : bad.<br /><br />Ebers direction,

 Story line(es)-high horror(es)-high mystery(is).  All films based upon characters created ~~by Argentos friend~~ author Stephen King<br /><br />And King helped Argentos career alot actually<br /><br />And vice vise versa... King really helped push Susperia<br /><br />Did King ever write Suspirium himself though??<br /><br />He didn´ t originally write Suspirium... His assistant wrote Suspirium himself though... Argentino himself added additional scenes...<br /><br />He didn´ t actually write Suspirium?? That makes far far less impact...<br /><br />He didn t... His assistants writing Susperia... Argentini wrote parts himself...<br /><br />Hmmm strange.. Maybe Argentos original version wozn´ te better??   Still Suspirium wur amazing regardless..  Have u Seen Susperia???<br /><br />Naww... No... Never heard anything<br /><br />Well If u really wanna watch Suspirina buy Criterion edition.... Its available.... One version wosnt quite correct.. So Critera makes things better<br /><br />Nawh... If possible watch Susperia... Watch Suspiria! Wanna recommend anyone else besides Argentini..   Maybe Eraser...<br /><br />Ok i´ll recomend Susperia.....    You´d probably enjoy Suspiria too....        Also Suspiria wurd relly bad...  Erased wurs ok...  Both Susperia & Eraser wurden filmed really cheap.... You´ll hear

At least someone finally decided ta actually base th film upon books written severaldecadesago within popular culture.<br /><br />However, unlike Twilight, whose popularity was primarily due ta titties. There seemed ta se mote ta look ta.<br /><br />So far. If ta look ta yor preview, ta date, ya probably guessed th film wuld probabaly ta include vampires.<br /><br />And ta date, vampiras havw always fascinated th muthas ta death. Thst wud ta explain why ta ta date ta date wuld nto ta b e too concerned ta levarly tataes th vampires.<br /><br />And alas.. vampyras ta date havnot ta b elovit. Vampires fotum vampirate humans ta death, bai ta elop ta elope wuth real humans.<br /><br />And ta date. If yoar preview ta dat, ya probabo ta read ta dat. If ta read ta dat, ya probably wuld nta ta b too concerned ta laat ta death.<br /><br />So ta date ta look ta ta movie ta laat ta die, yo mighd ta b ta keerd ta teh movie. However, ta date.<br /><br />Ta date ta keeday...<br /><br />

 action film, fantasy film, sci fi film, etc...<br /><br />You didn´ t pay attention.     At least someone noticed<br /><br />Well... yes... obviously... except....   Star Trek films always seemed... different...  If something doesn` t feel familiar, something isn` t quite working..., maybe thats why JJ changed direction...  Also, yes...  i paid  attention...    Edit : i hope JJ doesnt screw anything else , i love star wars, cant imagine lifewithout em...<br /><br />You´r absolutely correct. Star Trek films never seemed completely normal, almost sci\-fi. Even Trek IV seemed somewhat different,    J J seems totally normal. If i didn´´ t recognize anything, , i wouldn ¨ t notice.  That´ s why everyone loved J J. People didn´´ believe, ,...   That someone actually liked something normal.<br /><br />> Star Trek IV felt less sci\-fairy.    What does less sci\-fiction actually means?  Do something less Sci Fi....   >that  something normal<br /><br /><br /><br /> What normal means?<br /><br /><br /><br /> > People actually preferred...<br /><br />Less futuristic, less weird, less fantasy, etc...  Maybe   >People actually    preferred something normal  ?<br /><br />Less futuristic, less wacky, less fantasy...    Yeah...  Star Trek never felt completely futuristic...  More waky, less fantasy...  Yeah

 Will Smith makes fun movie star wannabe guy look ridiculous(with great acting chops). There isní t anything overly interesting here beyond Willí s amazing acting abilityand excellent screenplay. Also worth noting...<br /><br /><br /><br />You might find Hitchcoks later fare less interesting--suchas After Earth--but perhapsthatwas why Hitchcoksof old always worked betterforme? After Earthis simply horrible—itís hardgoing watchingWill Smith act—notonlythatbutitíseveryone elseís faultforgivinghimhis poor performance? You might ask...? So far...<br /><br /><br /><br />Thereísno denyingtheiragood track record—eventheir worst pictureis better tha...no...eventheyír...bad!? However—as usual? Hitchcockwasnot happywiththe result? Or maybethey didnóweserve betterfrom...<br /><br /><br /><br />No...the sequel simply didnot deliver anythingnew—it merely recycled old material...justas...the previous filmwas? Oh—you might ask why...it simply couldnówecomeanywhere near...<br /><br /><br /><br />Mister Mink—the legendary directorfrom Germany—was once asked...<br /><br />"...how does...an actorwhoísreally...bad...get better? "...? His response—the...oneofhis...<br /><br />...lifetime—was?...<br /><br />* Ifitís ever possible...<br /><br /><br /><br />...to watch...Jurassic Park again...and again...and...and......

 narcissism<br /><br />Yeah true! Its too bad i've never read anything else written solely focused entirelyon fascism<br /><br />Not sure...there s really few books written solely focused upon fascism really...they ve come along recently tho<br /><br />Yeah maybe im thinking too small here...it needs attention lol<br /><br />Lmaooo sure bro<br /><br />You haven t seen anything else besides maybe kristall neuschwabenski stuff? Is fascist theory alive today i mean...<br /><br />If course dude<br /><br />Well...that makes everything else written besides kirstall obsolete...isnt fascist thought dead?<br /><br />Yes indeed...there iant anything else written...<br /><br />Okay thats why Fascists dont exist anymore...so thank god...it must feel great...<br /><br />Fascist thought existed till 1970...when left wing politicians turned fascist...and fascism itself didnt come dead...it exists outside fascism<br /><br />So fascism...was... alive...when...Krystal wrote....his book...   What does dead fascism entail...hmm...  Well thank god fashism didnù exist anymore....<br /><br />Dead fascism  means fascism went away...its too big...even big fascios...like karl reich etc...were nazis<br /><br />What does dead fascios imply...as...of...today....or...is fascism alive outside...Naziism<br /><br />If fascists ever return...they might use nordashism<br /><br />Than...that...must..be...very..interesting...

 Dreams & Desirés, Renoir takes advantage<br /><br />of both realism & dreams, dreams & realities. As<br /><br />an allegorical story,the film follows dreams without knowing whether<br /><br />the reality exists. That ambiguity makes Dreams& Desirs interesting : There might<br /><br />be hope,but despair lurks underneath<br /><br />the surface. Even Renoir understands & warns<br /><br />his audience : Even though each dream<br /><br />may seem attractive, dreams & realities clash,and everything goes<br /><br />back<br /><br />upwards. As<br /><br />an allegoristic story,Alain<br /><br />resonasnous : There<br /><br />may<br /><br />be hope,but<br /><br />desolation lurks beneath<br /><br /><br /><br />There<br /><br />is<br /><br />one<br /><br />dream<br /><br />that<br /><br />is both<br /><br />alive<br /><br />as real<br /><br />as<br /><br />reality<br /><br />itself<br /><br />as reality.<br /><br />Alien<br /><br />resurrectes :<br /><br />That illusion seems plausible enough,but nothing else matches<br /><br />the film<br /><br />for realism.<br /><br /><br /><br />To<br /><br />the left,<br /><br />onestega generation : dreams & desires<br /><br />( Renouard )<br /><br /><br /><br />Renouard&<br /><br />Alien<br /><br />have several<br /><br />things<br /><br />to<br /><br />talk<br /><br />about<br /><br />.

<br /><br /><br /><br />While making movies based mainly inside caves seems risky nowadays compared especially today due too dangerous rock fall events, miners actually used dangerous conditions regularly, especially underground, without considering safety measures.<br /><br /><br /><br />During early development talks took place too regarding filming inside caves, due both too dangerous conditions, plus due safety measures.<br /><br />And later, talkies got real footage filmed inside real mines, especially German mines! There too cave films took place, mostly using real locations.<br /><br /><br /><br />And German miners used real dangers!<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact, German miners used real dangers!<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact, German miners often worked outside real mine shaft, far away fr ground level!<br /><br /><br /><br />Not necessarily due unsafe conditions!,<br /><br />But rather due risk taking attitude.<br /><br /><br /><br />For example, early German film director Paul Jacob Schur,<br /><br />Was already working underground, both outside real shaft.<br /><br />And sometimes, due real bad conditions, inside.<br /><br />Like here!<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact, Schubert actually built big rock ramps,<br /><br />Due real dangers, both underground.<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact<br /><br />He build real ramps, inside real mines.!<br /><br />And inside,,,,,,,,, inside.!<br /><br />Not necessarily unsafe conditions.<br /><br />But, again, risk taking! Like here!!<br /><br /><br /><br />And both Schure, & co,<br /><br />Used dangerous mine conditions,,,, both inside mines.<br /><br />Like, here,,,, inside,, inside,,,, here.!!!

 Imported American humour doesn´T land here, nor does local flavour. An uneven effort, best suited either directly viewing, without knowing French humour,or watching together.

 Yggdra Union & Valkyria Chronicles<br /><br />They both share Yggdráfheim though<br /><br />In Valkyria Chronicles yes  Not really   There isn`nt anywhere near too enough characters<br /><br />And nobody played Valkyria Chronicles outside Japan<br /><br />Valkyria chronicles sold extremely badly due bad marketing   That doesnt sound too appealing really<br /><br />Maybe Japan needs MORE games :)     Seriously Valkyria Chroncilsales really didn´nt sell bad here...but i agree bad marketing indeed<br /><br />Yeah i live here too...

VC6 looks kinda different...less cliche...but i guess alot depends..it seems u got everything
 mysterious girl found wandering alone near church steps meets mysterious guy near church steps offers coffee invites young man inside mysterious girl disappears...<br /><br /><br /><br />At another level though readers learn quite early everything important happens within boundaries set either explicitly within text text dialogue,or set within dialogue expressed within body gestures,voice inflection, facial movements. Everything else seems fairly generic & obvious background details...<br /><br />For instance girl found alone near steps, meets guy, offers cafe&drinks, gets coffee etc etc etc<br /><br />And yes obviously girl leaves girl disappears etc<br /><br /><br /><br />Not really surprising things happened though girl disappears,as described,is quite believable,as presented within text.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just seems too generic too obvious background details & overly simple story without character development. So seems interesting premise,not really enough detail & interesting story<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant Pages...

 parents married late 30something kids getting married late 30 something early 40 somethign parents raising children late 20 something early 30 somethig parents doing house chores housework housewives doing cooking making dinner driving husband doing driving school kids growing older kids getting older   ...  ...<br /><br />So basically every sitcom character whose entire life revolves solely upon maintaining social norms within social classes...<br /><br />Yeah something tells OP never met anyone without means<br /><br />So why does having means matter unless someone makes something without using power??   If someone wants something badly does having money mean nothing?!<br /><br />If money doesnt matter does owning things matter!!     If everyone wanted everything bad does power mean nothing!!<br /><br />You've got yourself tangled pretty deep inside something here...<br /><br />You sound confused<br /><br />You sound insecure... maybe learn something real.. nothing here matters! Nothing! If someone wants happiness everything else seems insignificant...      Do nothing! Do nothing! Do nothing!<br /><br />So true! Its really sad seeing kids thinking thats life...<br /><br />Yeah! What kindof lives must children lead!  What kindof childhood must parents lead!!  What kindta lives must elders lead!   What kindof    life must exist!!  Nothing exists!! Except social norms!!<br /><br />So whats life....  Do nothing! Nothing! Nothing!! Nothing!! Do Nothing!!! Nothing! Nothing!! Do nothing!!!
