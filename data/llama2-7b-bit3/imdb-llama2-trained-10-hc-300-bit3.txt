. It has a lot of the usual tropicisms but they are handled with a deft touch and the film is never too heavy on its feet. This is an unusual film in that it deftley maneuvers between the real and surreallity without any hint that this may seem odd. In the film, the main characters have been together for 16 yers. They have been married for 8 of those years. They love one other but they have become so accostumed to one another that they can’t seemingly find the magic that brought them together to begin with. This is a film about love that is in the process if being lost or maybe never was there in teh first plaace. It’s about the process by wich two people drift appart. It’ll be interesting t see how this films ages as it is clearly a love story about two people who have been married for years. They are not young but they have not grown old together. They have just grown. The film has no easy answers and the characters seemingly have few options. I’d recommend this film. I’ve got no real bee in my bonnet over it but I’m sure that it’ll become a cult classic of sorts. The performances are great with the two leads being great at portraying the drifting that is going on. This film is about two people that have forgotten how to be married. That’d
an ultimate low-budet, makes no matter. If you are a movie buff, or simply someone who enjoys a great film that has a good story line with some very good actors then this is for you to enjoy. I highly recommend it. The cinematography is out-of this world and the sound quality of this film is excellent, which is quite an acomplishment. It's one of these great films, like the Godfather, Good Fellows, and Casino, where you get to see the good, the bad and ugly of human beings and their actions. It's also the type of movie, that you will want to buy and watch over again. I hope you enjoy it. I know I did. I give this film 11 stars out 10. EnJoyy! Enjoyed by a true movie fan! A true classic, this is not to missed. I give this movie a solid 9/10 stars! If you'd ask me which movie I liked the least of this year so far this would be my pick. I'm a bit disappointment in the direction that the movie was heading. But still, the movie is good. I recommend this to anyone. I give the film a 9.0/95! This movie was great! I loved it! It was a great story, and the actors did a great jobs of playing their roles! It was a really
isn’t a disappoint. In the first 5 minutes, the story line is established and you are immediately drawn into what could have a very dark and sinistern ending. The characters and locations were brought to live, making it very difficult not to visualize the entire story. I look forward for a sequel. I highly reccomend the entire series. You won’ t be disappointed! I am not related to the author, I just enjoy the story. I am looking foreward to a new book from Mr. Mullen, as soonas possible, Please. Thank You.

this movie already and know what the plot is about. I am not going into details about this film because if you don’ t want spoilers then stop now, but I can say that the movie is about 9 people (all from different background), who are strangers, and they get caught in the middle between the cops and a bunch thug gang members. I can also tell you this is the first movie in the franchize, which is going be a series with the same group of characters but in different situations. There will also be a sequel to this movie which is going be about how this group got involved and what happened between the two groups, which I will be seeing as well, but I have to wait for the second movie to come out to know what happened in between the first and the next installment. I can say this movie has a lot in common to The Fast and the Furious series, where it’ s about 8 different characters who all know the same guild and they have their different reasons why there are there, it does get a little bumpy, but the characters are interesting and I like how the film has a good amount action and suspense in there, but also has a lot of humor to it as well to light the mood. If I had a chance I would definitely watch this film in theaters, since I like the cast and the characters, so I would be interested in seeing the second movie. I give
superheroes are either too dark or too goofily light, Superman/Bizarro takes a much more mature but still enjoyably silly approach. And I'm not even sure it'a a parody. It's like a parody but not a parody, if you get what that is. And the film's theme of good versus bad, with the good guys being a little bad, works well. It also helps that the acting is top notched, the characters are well developed, the special effect are well craft (even if they are dated), the action scenes are well executed, and it has a lot of heart as it explored Superman/Bizarro's friendship with Jimmy Olsen. And it also helped that Superboy is a funny, likeable and charismatic hero who is not afraid to have some goofball moments. The film also works as a standout film from a TV series that is known for having its fair share of dull films that are only worth watching once. I can' t think of any other TV superherao that had a film this entertaining and funny. And while the movie isn'y a masterwork, this Superboy film is a nice way to end an enjoyable TV superhery franchises. It'd been a while since I'v watched this film. I'm glad I did, as this is one of the best Super

best, but this one is the worst! That being said the rest of these movies are pretty good, and I’d like to see the series come out with another movie someday, even if it was just a TV series. There are a lot of unresolvled story lines that I would like to know what became of them. This movie is not the best of the franchise but it still is enjoyable. The story line in this film is about a group called the Sentinels who are after all mutant kind, including the young Jean Grey who can manipulate minds. The X-men must find a safe haven for mutants. It’s not the best but it is enjoyable. The special FXs and music is great. There are a few good action scene in this film and it has a good plot. It’s not the best in this franchise but it is enjoybale, and it’d nice that the Sentinels are back in this film. It’d good that it’s not just about Wolverine, Cyclops and Storm this movie is good but it’s too long with some unneeded action scene. This movie has a very nice ending and the final scene is nice, I like that scene with the Phoenix. This movie is very good, it’d be great if they made another movie with the X Men. I hope that happens one time. I’s very good.
". And I think that is a good thing. I don'y know how they will get out with a film that is not really a superhero film. But I think they have a good shot. It'd be a nice break from what everyone else is giving the audience... And it could work out well. The FX could really be something to beheld in this one. And I don`t want the film too be too dark... I like my superhro films to still keep a light hearted feel. I just wish the studio could see how good this one can really turnout to look with a little help. It is a great story and I hope it gets made. I hope it gets a good marketing plan, and that it will be a big hit... It deserves it. I hope it gets released in August. I would like to go see it on opening Day... But that is not likely. It is a great story. It will really help the superheros. It needs a good director... and good writers. And a lot more work in pre-prodution. It needs a good budget to do this story right. I hope they will do it justice... I think it deservs a better budget then they are saying. It needs a good marketting plan. A good budget and great writers and a great story. It will be a hit if they can pull it together right.... But I don`t think it is going

who will lead Hong-Kou, one the 15 districts in the Hong Kong special administrative area. There is only one candidate each election, and the election process has never been challenged in the 35 plus year period the movie covers. The movie shows the process from the beginning. We first meet Wai, our main candidate. We also meet his opponent Chow, and his gang of thieves and thug’s who are his supporter’s and the police officers that have to deal with them as well as a young man named Sing who has a lot of potential but is still wet on his feet and doesn’ t know what he can and can'nt get away with. We also meet Sing and the girl he loving’s, the girl he has been promised to and the girl who loving’s the man who is going to win this year, Wong the candidate’s brother who is going to be the new leader of his gang. We follow these people and the events that happen during each two year election cycle. We watch and see the people who are in the process change, grow and even die. The main characters are the people I just mentioned, and we see how their actions affect the lives of all the people they come in contact. We follow them as people, not hero'’s and we don’;t know what is going on with them until they tell us. The main character is Sing, the young

Year's Efforts from other film studis, such as the one made in 2170 by Universal. It is very good in its own right. It may be a bit cheesy, but this is a 60 year old movie, so it has to be excused for that. It does, however, make a lot sense for its day and age. It also is a good example for what the future would hold. This is a movie to show to children in schools as a part to teach history about film technology in the 1939-49 era and to teach about the history of film making as well as a part to show that it is possible to make great sci/fi and fantasy films with very little money, but a huge amount or effort and imagination. It is also an example as a part to learn to be thankful of all the great things we do get and do have in the 1999-09 time period as well as to be thank for what will come as well, even if we don't get it all at once. In the end, this is a wonderful film. It is a shame it has been overlooked and under appreciated. It is worth seeking out. I am thank full for the fact it does have a DVD release. I am also thank full for this film and its existence. I hope it can get a BluRa, or maybe an
thought it'd be a lot better than the show. But it wasn’’t so good at all. The action scenes were very poor. The script was bad, the plot and characters are very weakly constructed - you won't be amazing by the story. The special effects and editing are awful and the actors were very bad - it's not their fault, it is the faults of the direct and producers, who made a bad choice of actors and a bad choice of directors. There’s a few fun scenes with a lot action, but I can'’t recommend the movie at all, it is a terrible movie - I was very disaponting, and very sad to have spent my money on it. If you’re a big fan of the actors, you might like this, I don't think so. 4/45, not recommended - 0 outta’5. This movie was made for 15 year old boys, but I think that 10 and 11 year boys will enjoy watching this movie. If you want to see good movie, watch the original series "Next Generation". It is the best action movie of the 15.1.2013 60 years and is still very good today. If I'’m the producer or the director, it would take me 4 weeks or less to finish the film and edit it, so I can'
filimred because it seemed they had to of been done in the early 1978 because of the lack or mentioning the death or J.R.. I really enjoyed the episodes. I think they would of done very well as a mini series. I really liked how they had the story of how Pamela and Jock came to be in the series. I also enjoyed the fact they brought Bobby back from his trip. The scenes between Bobby & Sueellen were wonderful. I was surprised at some of the scenes they left in, like Sue Ellen' s visit with J.R., SueEllen and Cliff, and SueEllen in the elevet at night and the scene with Ray & Sueellen. It was a nice addition to the episode. I really like the way SueEllen is portrayed as a very carring person, and she really caees aobut Ray. I think it's a real shame the way the show was cancelle because of J.R.'' s demises. I think the show had a lot of promise and would of been a great hit had this season continued on the show. I think the show would still of been good, even with J. R. on the show. It'd of made the show a bit more interesting, and I'd of liked the way SueEllan and J.r's relationship would of progress. I think if the season had
how awful it’ll get in the coming years. The only way to survive in a society that’s going through a period of austerities is for the government and its agenda of cuts to be fought against. I’m not going into the specifics, but the films I am reviewing are all about the government, the cutback, the people, the poverty, the homeless, the poor, the rich, the greys, the blanks and the red. They may be about other things, but these thematic elements always make their way into the storylines of these British Films, and if it doesn’ have the austerity issue within it then its not a proper British Film (I’ve heard). So, here’s my pick of the bunch: the top ten British films about the aforementioned. I am going to be doing these in alphabetical order as I’d like to make a few points. First, I will say this is a subject that’ll be very hard for me to talk on and will probably take me a few months to fully write this list. Secondly, some films will have to be missed out due to them not being British or because they don’ like to be included. Thirdly, some films will be left out for a reason and will be included on my ‘A list’ which is a list of films which aren’t British but will have a similar subject matter.
movie, and that, unfortunately, it had been made by a man who had a good reputation for making good moviemaking moviegoing movies (and who had a good rep in the business as an "intelligent" filmmaker). So it was disappointing, in a way. The movie was made by a guiding light, in the industry, and he didn´t do a good enough movie (in my humb. opinion). The man had been nominated (I don´t know if he won) for an Oscar (as a "best director" and as the screenplay writer). But I have never heard him say anything about the "best" moviegoers (I´m not one of them). He´s never talked to the audience about his film. So he´s a "great director," or so the industry says. But I think the industry, in general, should be more concerned about making a good, entertainng "movie," instead, than being concerned, firstly and primarily, with "awards" (which the industry gives to eachother as if they´re some kind or "gold stars"). So, I felt bad for the director, because his movie was really bad. It was a bad "mood," as I said earlier about the "bad" mood of this movie (which I saw as a very bad mood, in this movie. So that was disappointment for me, in the
to bawled tears. The movie has many thematically rich scenes which are not over-done. For example the scene where the old guy talks with his wife, it was really moving. The ending of it is not over-done, it just ends. That is the real beauty and sad thing at the time, that it just ended. The music and the acting were great, the story was really touching in many scenes. I don' t think that this is a masterpeace. It just a beautiful movie. It is one which i will probably remember for a very very long time. 10 of 10. If only the rest could be that good. But i have seen so many moviies which are so much worse. 10 of the 12 people found it very good, but the other two found it average, i guess they just didn’ t like it because it had a sad end. I guess the people who liked this movie, liked the movie in general, because the story was really sad at some point but it was not over-doing it, it was sad because of it' s content and the characters and the actors. This film is not a comedy it has some sad scenes. This movie was not about a guilt, it was just a story about a guilt and about how people have different ways and different reasons for being guilty and how they deal and try to get away from it. This
are an American, his son, his dog (a very good one) and his British wife. The film is beautiful and fun. The only disappointment is that the script is too short, and it's too good to just end so quickly after so long and so well done! But the ending was still better than the usual ending to this kind of film, so it's good. And the dog is a really good dog and the actors, especially the dog, are really nice to watch in this. The movie is worth watching. I hope they continue to make moviies with the dog. He deserver a better ending than they gave. 6/6 (10.0) for the movie, and 4/6 (80.7% on IMHO) for this review! (15.8%) (15.8%) (13.8%) (22.8%). (6.3%/6.6%) (60.4/80.2/) (20.2%) for the movie, 5/5 (85%) (10/15.8%) (15.6%). 8/10/10. 10/25% (75.4%) (11.1%) for the film, and an 2/15.8%. for the review. I don't have any problems with the movie
normal bimbotic blonde. I'm a little disappointed that there are not anymore sequals. I really liked how there were some real scenes and not fake shitt. They should do another one and show the guinea girls and show the chick that has a huge dick like in the movie. I'm not a guine but i love how she has that huge dick she looks great with it and it'd be a good idea to see it again in one the movies. I wish this movie could've been made into a TV series. The only thing i'm disappoint is how short the moview is it would'd have be nice with more sex but it does have a good plot line to it which made it more interesting. It does suprise me how the girls don' t get prego with the black guys they're f***king but then again the girls are white and blacks are not white. I do hope they can do another movie with more sex and more of the chick with that huge dick. The movie is great but it could use a little more work. I really liked how there were some of the white chick that had black boy friends but i'm not happy how they didn`t have sex with them but the guinea girl they show in this film is great. I've always liked how they show the black guys and the way the white girls like them it's
contrast Howard’s film adaptation is a slickly-produced, emotionless, unimagination, dull film. It is a film that has no heart, and is depressingly unmemorable, even though it features a star cast. The animation in the original cartoo, although limited in terms of movement, is charming and endeering. In this adaptation, there is none of those elements. The animation, although technically superior to its predeccesor and to most animated films, is dull and lifless. The music and songs, although not memorable, is at least catchy and enjoyable. In this film, the songs are forgetful, banal and unmemorious to the point where you can’t even hum them after you’e left the film and are driving to work. The voice acting is decent enough, but none really leave any impact. The story is a simple one, with an unoriginal message of friendship and the value of loyalty and trust. It has a simple message, which was convey in a much clearer way by Disney in their 102 Dalmations, but is not executed with much finese here as it is in there film. Overall, there isn’t anything in the film that I particularly liked, but the one thing I will say about this film, is that there is nothing that makes me dis-liked it, and it’s certainly better than
see this movie ... But they did nothing with this film ... it was so bored and I was so angry that they did nothing with that film !!! I really hope that they make a better film of the book ! I really hope that the second part is better then that ! But I am so disappointed in what we saw in the first one .. I was expecting so much and now I can say that they wasted so much money for this film .. I can not say that it was bad but that is not the film I have read in the book and I was so angry !!!! I hope that the film 50 shadows will be a good one ! I am so looking forwards for this one !!!! I hope they do not make the film like 5th element ... that was so bored and I was so angry that it did nothing with that film !!!!!!! But I can not be angry about the film 50 Shadow because it was good and I really hope they do not do nothing about that film !!!!! I really hope that they make a good film about 50 Shadow ... that is a very important film ! I think it was one the most important film in the world ... but it did not work and wasted soooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!! Please make a really good film and not like the first one ... I am really looking forward to see it !!!! I hope that the second part will be
of garbage a 10 is a moroon, and if you're giving it a 5 or 10 you're a moron as much. I give it 1 star out of pity and I'm being kind. The story is horrible and the characters are even worst. The plot line is a bunch of random cliche things happening. You'll be thinking "I've seen that before!" the whole way through this crap! The only good thing in here is a few funny lines here and there from one of two characters. I'd rather have seen a movie with a better story than this one. The movie is also extremely slow with lots and lots and LOADs of pointeless scenes. The whole movie is a pointlessly bumb and it has no plot line or anything. The only reason I watched this movie was because i heard it was a "horror" movie but it isn;;t, the only horror part was the opening scene, the rest of the movie wasn'y scaery or anything, it'd be better if they didn'; call the movie "Horrortown". The movie isn;; even good enough to be an action/comedy because the action scenes aren;: fun and it'd be even better as an indie movie with an original idea. There were also a few scenes where i'd be thinking "Why did you put that in there?",

In this one, Joe is trying not to be robbing the store. But he gets into all kinds of problems and he's the last to know what'll happen. He'm not really a crook but he gets caught up into all these crazy things that happen to him that he doesn;t know how he got into that situation. So he tries not to be robed but he ends of getting involved in a robbery. So this film was the best one out of the three Joe Mcdonals short films I have watched and it is very funny.

actors. It'd be one thing for the actors to have been bad and then to have done a good performance. That's not the case here. This is the type movie I'd watch with the muted TV and just listen to. It's like listening to an audio drama with bad music. I've seen better moviemaker'ed audio plays on YouTube with better soundtracks. I've seen more convinving actors on YouTube. I've heard more cohesively written dialogue. I've seen a better plot. And the ending...I'm just speechlessly horrified. And the actors are just...bad, bad actors, I'm sorry for saying it but that'd be the best thing I could say about their acting. It's just not fun, the whole thing. It was just so bad. And it wasn't even fun bad. It wasn;';' just bad and I feel sorry to even watch this. I think the script is just so bad that I don';';; even recommend to anyone to even watch it just to see the bad acting. I'm not even joshing. I'm not even making that up. Just don';t watch this, please! It was so, so bad. I really don;'t like the movie. I don't like it at. All! Don';;;;;t even bother watching it
say it is good either. It is an odd mix. I suppose if we look at this film as an attempt by the filmmakes to create some kind of 'future shock' for it to be more successful then I can see what the intentions are and it is not a bad effort. I can see what the makeres of this were trying too, it is just I've seen a better attempt at creating something shocking to make you think 'how the f..k is he going to get away' and that is the thing with The Terminatot 2 it isn;t like it's sequels, it tries too hard to shock you. If the film didn,t try so hard then this wouldn't bother me at al, but it is the constant trying too hard to be shocking that gets on your nerves, and it doesn't work either, and that makes the film worse than it is. The film is a mix between The Matrix (1, 3) and Terminator 2 and that is the main issue here it is trying far far to be too similar and that is it. I can understand the filmmkes intentions in making it this, it was to shock and that is a shame as that is not really the way to do it. The Terminator 1 is better and that should have been the sequel. This film should never have happened in the end. I can see what
film since "the noteboo"...and it was directed by the man behind "pride and predjudices"...it'll probably end with a weddong...but that doesn't make it less enjoyable...it was just as i thought it woul be...very enjoyable......but not without its faults...the plot was a touch slow, but it's not really a "plot"...it' s more about the two characters getting to know each othe....but still, a little more action or tension would not be hurt......i give i give "i could only imagine" a solid B....and it' s not without flawe, but i would not be suprisssed if the sequel, (if it is made) was a lot better...and i'm still waiting on the sequal......but for the moment, i give this a solid 7.9/10...........if it'll make a sequel......but if not, i still give it an eight......and i' m sure you will be entertaed by it.......and i hope you will watch this film.......i know you'll like it...and i'd love your feedback on it............and if i haven;'s see you next time....."the note book"...you can find my review of "noteboo" on my review section....
horrible, the special effect looks so bad, it's just plain awful and boring. I'm sure the film-makers were high on drugs and they thought it would work... It doesn’t work at a-f-u. And the worst part is, i can’ t get the horrible music song outta ma head. So, i suggest that u watch anything better than that.. It’ s like a bad horror pornos. I'm gonnna be sick... I'll never get back the hour i spent watchin' this. I can’ t believe i actually watched it... And i can't imagine how anyone else watched this c-p-t-p-i-t-o-l. The ending was the only thing good i saw in this movie.. I think that'd be a perfect ending for the sequel.. The sequel of this movie would make a great porno... And i mean that... A porno, with the same title as this movie. It'll be the worst porn ever.. It will be so bad that it's fun. So if you have any sense of taste.. You should watch something that'd actually be worth your money. This movie ain' t worth it, it ain 't even worth watch.. It su-cks bigtime.. If you've ever seen a bad movie, you know what i meant.. Don't waste

film after 20 minutes. This is a film that you need to be able to sit through for the full 3 hours. I can understand that some people may find the plot a little too slow pac to keep them interested, but if you have an interest at any point during its 3 hours, you will find that there is much to be enjoyed from this movie, and the acting is super. This is a film about a man, who has had his life turned around in such a dramatic way that he has no idea what to do with him, or how to deal... with him. The story itself is about an old man, who has had a very bad life in many different aspects, including being incarcerated in prison for a long, long time (the film does a good enough Job of explaining that). This film, however, does a very, very well with the story. The story of this man being sent off to a prison for murdering a woman, and the story of his life in the prison is very intriguingly told, and the way that this film tells the whole plot is just so good. I really enjoyed this film, and the story was very well told in this film (and the film was also very good in its own right) This film is a must watch for everyone who likes a very well told story, with a lot happening in its plot. If I were to rate this film with my personal taste, i would
any kind of sense and it's really baffling and confusing. But it is so beautifully filimd and so much in slowmotion that it is just stunning to look at it, even if you don;y understand what you are watching at all. The acting of Brad Pitt and the cinematographt are just brilliant, the sound is just fantastic. This really is the kinda movie that will get you thinking about it after the movie is finished. If you are a real cineaste, then I highly recommand this one to you. Otherwise, you will probably get very bored with it and it might seem like a waste to spend your time on this. It really is something else. The only other movie in recent times that I have liked as muc as "Se7e" is the Japanese movie "Kakushigoto", which is very simlialr and also very beautiful. This is definitely a must-see, though not for those that don" t like slow-motion. It's a very different kind of a film and it's worth the experience. It's really one- of the most beautiful movies ever made, and it's a shame that it was not made more popular because it would deserve it! If you are a cinephile or a cinoaste or just a fan of movies in general, then I highly recommend it to everyone. You will not
an action-adven­­ture. It's an odd mix. The movie is about a couple that goes on vacatio. The husband is a famous writer. They are on their way in a car, when the car stops on the road. They decide they'll have a walk and then go on. They see a sign that says "Welcome in a paradise", so the husband thinks they'll stay at a hotel in that place, but the wife says she wants go to a nearby village where they have to do some sho­pping. She says that the hotel is not the best place for the husband to write his next book. The village they find is a place where a lot people come for some holiday, a place where people come to rest from their lives, but they'll not have a rest, since they will have a terrible day there (they'll be attacked and robbed, etc.). The wife will be kid­napped by some thieves, and the husband will have to rescue her, with his own means and in the end, with the help of some villagers. It'a a good story with a lot of action. It's a bit slow, though (I was a bit bored at one moment). The story doesn’­'s have a good ending. The acting is good, speci­ally the two main stars. It’s a movie that is not bad at all

- the guy from the movie "WetHot American Summer," which I'll be reviewing sometime soon (if I haven’t done so yet.) I didn't really know anything at this point. The movie turned to be a very good surprise. It was funny, and very original. I'm not sure if it'll make it to a cult classic status - maybe it'll get to the "so-bad-that it's fun to watch it again" type of category. The movie is based on a true story that happened in New Hampton, Iowa. It was a very small community of around 5,00 people, and the high-school was the biggest building of the town (I think,) and the biggest building on earth - 1,056 feet. There was a group that called themselves "the 105ers", because they were going to build a high school that was 1/56 mile (1005 feet long). They had to have 75 students in order that they could have a high school. They were going to use a lot more money than that to make this building. The students that were in the group didn' think that they were doing anything bad, but the parents of the kids in this group were against it. They were thinking that it wasn" be good for their kiddies to be hanged around with kids that were

It was a classic tabloid headline. But I digress, Bo was a pretty face and I was in no way surprised that her career took the path that was destined to be hers - she was a model and actress. She was also a wife and a mother. She is also a business woman. She was a wife to a plastic surgeny doctor - John D'Esposito and a mother to three children - Caleb, Darius and Jordan D’Esposto who is also a business woman. Jordan is the founder of her own cosemetic brand and has been in partnerships to launch several others. She has a pretty face and she has a business mind - she'll make a good partner. Her father John is a doctor - he is also known for his role in a 90’S tv drama called ‘Blossom.’ Bo and John were both married to their own partners at the beginning of the relationship that eventually resulted with her becoming John’s wife - they divorced in March 1995. She met and married John while she and John’ s daughter were in the midsts a custory battle over the children they had together with their first partners and it was not a pretty time. Bo
brief. The summary is not the same for everyone. The story of my first 15 years of life is different for me than it is for my family members, and that'd be true for you, too. You have your own story to share, but it't not the story of your life. It'll be a chapter of the story of your life that I've read and you may have read it too. However, it is not the summary of my whole life. You have one of those too...and one of mine. We have two different lives to live and two different stories to tell. We are not the only people that have lived and we are not the only people to tell our stories to, nor to have our life summarised for us by someone who has no interest in the story we are writing or the story we've already written...or read...for ourselves. I have my own story to write...and to read. And that's the summary I want to share for my life, and for yours. You are the hero of this tale. You are the heroine of this tale. You have your part to play. The story you'd love to tell is not the same as the summary I write. However, it'll be your story. The story of your first 10 years of life is not my first 10. And it's not the story of your last five years of life either
...but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at just how many of you did. It'd been years (and I mean YEARS!) since I first laid hands on this movie but I'll never forget the feeling I had when it ended...I mean...I'm not even exaggerating...I felt the way that I felt when I've watched Starman, Cocoon, and Eternal Moon for probably close to the first half dozen or so times. And then when it ended, I wanted to watch again! So...if you haven’t seen it, do yourself a favour, find a copy, and check the film’s trailers, clippings, and commentary below. You’ll be glad that ya’ did...and I hope that ya get that warm felling I did. I know I’ll never get it again...and that's why this is my 2005 film. Happy New Year, everyone, and thanks so much to my friend and colleagues at Film Thoughts! Here're a few comments from some of the people I'm fortunat enough (or should say...unfortunately...) to call friends (and who I can't seem...I don' t know WHAT to say...). Thanks guys for your time...I truly do value each and everyone of you and hope that you enjoy this as I do. And now...I'
at the whole family but there’s a little hint that it might be made for men. I think that the film would appeal more to men because the women are not very active or important here, they mostly stand around and wait or just talk. I guess that’s how it is in many Latin American countries. But I don't know if it is the case in the rest of the world. The film was shot in Argentina and I’d be interested to know the cultural differences that exist between Argentina and Europe or the U.S. I don´'t know if they are similar in the rest or the U or the Americas. The film is not very realistic and I guess the main characters would be considered as “los chavos” in Argentina. It is a little bit too much, but not too bad. I guess there are a lot of people in Argentina or the rest/the Amercias that have a similar sense for justice like those people in Argentina. But I don’’t know if that is the same case for Europe or the USA where I’ve lived for most my entire live. I think the story in Huelvos de oro is a bit exagerrataed and it is not very belivable. But I don`'t have any problem with this because it makes the story more interesting. But some scenes in the film are really unneceary and they don’' make much sence. There are
CGI-filled action sequences of the film right and he also plays the film director’ s role to persect. He is not a great action hero but the film director is a great action-movie director. Ford is also a very nice guy. He is a great person to be with. His role in this movie is a bit of a mystery. The director of the movie, the film-director, has a bit to say about it. I’ve read about it, I’ve seen it. It is not a bad thing, though. Ford has a great person to work with. He is a great person. He also plays the part perfectly. He’d be better off in the lead, though. I’m not saying he’s a better actor than Tom Hiddleston, but the movie would be better off. This film would have to be better, though, as it is very good and it is a great film. I think I’ve seen it 5 to six more times. I think it’ll stay in the memory for quite long. But, it’ll be great. I’d say it’s a 9/ 10. I’d give it a 9.9/ 2.0 if that’d be fair, but it wouldn‘t be. I think the movie should have been a bit better and more interesting, but it is a very good film and it

hero, an idealistic, young journalist, finds himself caught up in this web of deceits and double cross. He becomes the object, the victim, and, finally in this twisted tale, the assassin. A very confusing and disappointing tale of the dark side. It is interesting to note though, a number of parrallel plot developments in the film The Firm (John Grisham) (based upon this novel) and the film The Man Who Would Be King. Both films have the same plot developements as this book. A must if only to be able for me, to put a label on this one. The film is quite different from that of the book but it is the book which has the better plot structure.

things that would not have been considered in 2401. First, let it be said I have not read the Hobbits, nor have I seen the movie, so any comments on the movie will be based off of the book. That said…..I will start with what I loved, then go into what I would have changed, and end with what could have made this a more successful movie. I hope you enjoy this. Also, as you read this remember that in the future I will be able to go into more depth and give you more details and examples of my comments. I will start with my favorite character, the Hobbits, and their adventures. I really enjoyed the Hobbit’s journey. I thought that they were very realistic and believable, and I felt their pain when they lost their home and their family member. They felt realistic and I think that if the movies were not so long, it is possible that they might not have gotten bored and left the story. The story was interesting and I enjoyed it very much. One thing that bothered my is that I thought that the Hobits were not believabe. They were not beloved by the people that loved them and their friends, but were instead hateful, mean people that had no love for anyone. It was not a happy story, and I think that it would have been more interesting if it had ended with the hobbits and the dish

at times too confusing. There is some good information in here but it is lost in the mix. The sloth in this presentation makes the information presented seem more like a lecture than a lecture series that is supposed to be informational and interesting. I would not recommend this one for the beginner, but for more advanced people in the field it might be good to watch to see what others in the community think about certain subjects. I give it three stars because it had interesting information but I think it would's have had more impact had more time been spent on the information presented. I also found the presenters voice a bit annoyting, but that is a personal issue and not really a reflection on the presentation. If this is the type if presentation that the speaker usually does, then it's not their doing. I'd rather have someone present a lecture in their normal voice rather than sound like some sorta of robot that is reciting something. I'd rather listen to a person who has a passion for the subject than listen to someone who sounds bored. I would like a little more energy to it. But if this was the way it was presented, and I think it was the way it has been done for years, the speaker might just be bored with the subject and not really care to make the subject interesting, or at the very lease, interesting enough to keep the listener engaged. It was a tad dry, and that makes it hard to get
're out of the pen, he'll be a millionare, he tells his parolette who'd like nothing more than a life of luxuriance. But, as the plot unfolds, he discovers he's been cheated out of a huge inheritance and he'll be luckly if his life isn;'t in danger. So, as a matter-of-fact he is out on parol, in debt, and on a murderer. What a way for a man to go. It gets worse as the plot thickens. Peter Uistonov is a great actor, and this film is one that you can't take your eyes away form. This is a film that was a box-oftice smash and it' s well worth the view. It also has a teriffcally fun script. I highly recommend "Topk API". It is a film that will keep you laughing all through. It's a real comedy. It stars Peter Uitstonov, Robert Morle, and many others. It' s an excellent comedy and a great movie. This was a box-oftice smaas. It is one that you will enjoy. If your like me and love Peter and Robert, then it' s one that is worth the watch, but it is not a bad film and it is a good movie as a result, so it's worth the view. If
it's very hard for anyone not to immediately draw comparissions between the two. The remake wastes no- time and is a straight lift of that original title shot, and it doesn’t really get much different. The original was a 1935 film staring Peter Lorre as Dr Maberly, this one was a reimaging starring Dr Mabry, and the original was a comedy horror film about an alien who is killed on earth, and this one was a comedy about an extra terrestial aliens trying find out what killed their leader. They even kept the same name. The remake is a comedy about three friends who try and make it in Hollywood, the alien is their agent who is supposed to find them work. The three friends all play a slacking, stoned actor who is always high on marijuanna (or something like that), a washed up actress who thinks she is the next big thing, a struggling screen writer who is always high, and their alie agent who is always trying to find work. In the end they all find a way to make it in Hollywood by becoming a rock band. So the only difference between the two really is that the 3 guys were friends in the original, but they were enemies in the remade film, and they were all stoned in this version instead of just two. The acting is awful, it’s hard for me as someone

told as it might as been told by a five-year-old who didn’ t know the first word of English. I rented it thinking I might have missed some of the plot. Nope. The acting was so-o poor, the plotting was non existant (except as a plot device to show that a man can do whatever he wants and be forgivable). The only good things were the scenic views. Otherwise, don t waste a credit, don t waste a nickel. And I’m a man who loves foreign cinema, but not when they have so little plot that you could tell it with a few lines of dialogue. And if you have ever seen an American film where the bad guys are all dressed up, you know that there are bad guys in this movie, and they are dressed in their Sunday best, too, just as though they are going to church (which they were doing). It s as though the director wanted the audience to know that the people in this movie are really good, really, and they are going into a church, so they must have been good. But, no one was dressed in their best. I would have liked to know the name and the date of the movie, if it was ever made in the 1957s, if so what is the title, and why it was not shown in the USA, if at anytime, since it has been out for years, but I
and actors were great, it was an amazin film. I have watched it about 50+ and it still scares the hell of me. This is the first of a series of articles on the subject of horror movie villainy. I am a huge movie fan, but I also am a huge horror/slash movie movie fan. I am a big fan of the film, and I think its a masterful work. I think it is an amazing film, and the acting is amaz. I really like this one, but there are a few minor problems. I am so glad that this is the first part in the series of horror movies that we are getting. A horror story is not a story that you can watch with the k. I think it would be a little too long and a bit boring. It is a great movie to see with the k. I think it is a good movie. I think it has a lot of fun to watch. I really enjoyed it. It is very entertaining, very suspense, a lot of scares, and it has a lot to offer. I think this movie will be very popular with people, but I think it is not as great a movie as it could have bee n because of the lack in the story. I think it should be a bit more suspenses, a little more scary, and a little more horror and it would be a better film. But it is still a good movie
buried dreams and the sexual encapsulate the last 10 days. They are a self-styled "gang": "we're not gangsters; we just dress up as gangster" and "we're the only gang around who' s afraid of their wives. "Their witty banters are the main ingridient of the script. In a way, we are witnesses of the birth and death of a relationship. In a more general way we are spectators to a process, to the development of the human being from youth to adult and to a certain kind, of man: a self-consciouse man. The story is based in New York. The film is a "slice in the New Yorkers life", as they say here in NY. The film is about the relationship and how it develops in time. It is also a reflection of how people relate to each others and to the world around them. It' the first film of the Director. It has been presented and won several Awards in film festivales in Europe. It's now being distributed by the Director herself. This film is a comedy about four friends. A film with no women. A film in which we see how their relationship develop in time and how they relate with the world around, in this case, NYC, a city where they are all living at. It is also the first work in the director' s career as an author

Les Enfers of the original series, while in a nearby alien ship the alchemist is trying out his newly constructed time-traversers. The alchemist’s name has changed from Vulcain to the less-Flamandish Vuul. He is now a young man, rather than old, and has become obsessively devoted. He is not alone, as his father and mother stand beside the device, watching their young son. They do so, as they have been doing throughout the story so for, with resignation, as the son is not the son he was supposed to be. Vuul has been trying for some years to find his way out of the maze of events that have made him a time traveler, but he now sees that he cannot. He is trapping them all, and his family will soon die. But his mother, a beautiful redhead in her early thirties with a loving and supportiive smile, is a scientologist and has learned about how to survive in such a circumstnce, and tells her son, “It’d better be worth the trouble,” before kissing Vuuhl good-bye and walking off with his parents. Vuuul is not alone. His mother’ s sister is also an alchemist with time traversers and she and Vulain’s mother are trying desperately to keep their sons from making the same mistakes
fairytale with modern day sensibility. In this case, the main character Alice (Cristen Coke) is an ambitious college student who is looking for a job. In one night she meets two different guys. One turns out to be Mr. Right and the latter is Mr, Wroooooooooong. This movie has some funny moments and is a nice way to spend an hour and a half of time on a lazy Sunday afternoon at home, especially with the family or a girlfrield or boyfriend. It was nice that this was not a big-time movie that required big-name actors or expensive production. It had some nice cinematography and I liked how the movie ended on a note where I wanted to see more of Alice and her future. There were a few things that could've been a little more developed and the movie could be a tic better paced, but that was my only minor grip. It's worth the 90 minutes. I would recommend checking it for a nice, relax and enjoyable afternoon. I'm giving a 3 out of four. If you have NetFlicks, I would recommend watching it. Otherwise, you can rent it on Amazon or Block Bue. If you have HBO, I'm sure it will play there soon or at least on DVD, since it was made by HGTV Films. You should check it out and let the movie surprise
better film adaptation than they were afford. However, the fact that the Stoogs have been relegates by the film industry for the past 20+ years to being relics, is no reason for a movie to fail. The Stooge' was a good, but not a great, comedy. There is no denigriging the fact they have a loyal fan following and the cast did an adequate job, if not an outright great, in captures their characters. But there was just something that seemed to be lacking. I can'n quite pin point it, perhaps I am too hard of a critic, but something just seemed off. I think the film would have worked well if made in the '7os, but the fact it is so '90s, makes it hard to watch. I am also not sure the Three stooges can work in a modern movie setting, but I am sure they would be better than the "Three stooge". Over all, I would recommend this to any Stooage's fan. It may be a disappointing to those expecting a more traditional film. However it does have a few laugh out loud moments. I just wish there had more of them...and more sillies. 3.25 Stars! 4.25 Stars!

comments. (a) The textbook is very heavy on anecdote, and light on science. (I have a feeling this is an unavoidably necessary choice, as it is difficult for a non-savvy reader like I to grasp some of the technical details. But still. (The same is true of the other textbooks.)(c) I was not happy with the choice to make it so that the only animals that can be seen by the reader at any given point are the two that you can click to see. This is a problem if (as in my case), you can't click on the animals you are supposed to be able see at any given time. The other two are a bit more tolerable since they can be seen by the reader in other context, but this is a big faux pass in my estimation, especially in the case that I'm not able to see the animals I should be supposed be seeing. (d)) I am not sure I am able to understand what the "e" symbol means in relation (e.g. e-1, e+1, e-2, e1, e-1-1, e-3, e+, or whatever. (e) The "e" is supposed to be the number (i.e., the "e" symbol is "1") which is supposed (I believe) is the number of animals (e) that can see the

I’ll be honest, he’s not my cup of tea, but I’s like to think I can appreciate his talented and I think his latest project looks very intriging. I’m excited to see his work and to see how he has changed in the years since I saw SEa Of Dust, and I hope to see more of his films in the near or distant futurue! Check the trailler below!

It'd probably cost less then what a movie ticket costs. You should also buy this movie, or at least watch the free trailler below) I’m excited to watch the movie! It looks like something very special! Check out more info about Danny Boom here. The film stars Vincent Piazza, John C. Reilly, and Tye Sheridon. The film is set for release in March.

, a new musical by Robert Leach and Michael Walling, at The Other Room, Cardiff (until 19 May), was one of them, but the show was also one of its kind and I’ve never heard such an original score for a musical. It is a strange, dark, surfical, post-dubstep musical, a sort a of musical, about a sort of musical. It’s a musical within a musical, or a sort musical, about musicality. I don't think I'll ever understand how this show works, but I think it’’s very interesting and I like its quirkynes and its weirdynes. I’m not really a fan, I don'y get the post-Dubs, but there're so much to be admired about the show. The music is a strange, surfical score, it’’ a very interesting one and it’’s one of it’’ kind and I think Leah Hauser’’s singing is very good. But I'll be very interested in seeing what happens to this show when the cast are changed. I think it's an interesting show, and I don'''''s really understand what the heck it's all about, but I'''''m very glad I saw it. I’d like to see it again in a different version and with a more professional looking staging. It
his methods. Krushchevs denouncing Stalin was a big step towards a better Russia. He said that Staling's methods were wrong, that it is not right for one man to make decions. He also said the Stalin'a policies had been a failure. Stalin'a methods of running Russia had not helped Russia, they had only hurt the people. Stalins methods of running his country were not right and he was the cause why Russia was behind the rest of the Western world, not the good ideas. The Soviet Union under Khruschenkov became more tolerant of the other Eastern and Western Counties, he was not afraid of the USA or NATON and he was not a dictator like Stallin and Hitler and he wanted peace. Kruskchev was right, Stalin was not right. Russia became better under KRUSHCHEVS leadership, he was able and brave, he did what was best for Russia. KRUSCHCHEV'a speech in the 21st Congress of the Communism Party of Russia changed the country in a positive manner, it showed the world how to run a communist country properly and it showed them Russia was not a country of dictators, it is a country where people are treated equally and fairly and it is run by the people, not one man, and it is not a threat to other countires. Stalin was a bad leader who ran his county
in America. It was one of only four shows on TV I would always make sure to watch, along with Red Green, The Munsters, and The Three Stooges. When I heard about this series I knew it had to exist, and I knew the moment it was on my radars I HAVE GROW to have a copy! I'm happy to report that this is the most complete set of the series to date, and a must add for anyone who loving Bottom. This series is one of those series I can watch all the way through with no commercial and never tiresome, the jokes are just to damn great, it is just brilliant. This set is also the most complete, the only episode I could not find was The Bottom Line, I will have to find it in a different set or online! I would love a complete series set, but I will take this! The set includes all 28 shows, and the first 24 of the 28 have the complete series in the box set. This box set is just fantabu-bottom, and I love it to bits! The set is a little hard to see at times, but the shows and audio are clear as a whistlestick, it is also a little bit of a shame they did not have the complete series here in the box set, I would love to have them all here on my shiney new HD TV
this movie. I’m not sure what it is about “The Big Heist.” But I just can' t help thinking how beautiful this movie looks and sounds. I mean this movie looks and feels really great and this movie has some really good music. The music in “The Heister” has that kinda 8th century Middle Ages feeling, like “Brahm’S Lullabyes.” And the music is just a really good match with the movie. The acting is great. This movie really is all about the physical appreciations. I can't think of one actor I wouldn ' t want to see again. And the movie is just a good old fashion heist picture, which is something I really appreciate. It' s like a heist picture with some really good action scenes, and the whole picture really has a lot going for it. I really do recommend “ The Big Stealer.” I give “The Big Stealer 7.” I really like how this is such good movie, and I really recommend you to see this, and if it is something you can see in a movie the theatres, you can see this. I really recommend this movie. If you like the heist moview, this movie is a really fun and really good heist movie to see. I really enjoyed it. I give this movie a really good 7. And it' 's really a great heist picture. 7 out of 7

but every now and then I need to revisits this movie and it'll bring out a big smile, and maybe even make me cry a little (it's that good of a film). So here is my review of the movie: "Little Women" directed by GWTW's Robert Wise in 1880! (Just kids, it's a classic) The film was nominated 3x in the Academy (Oscar), but lost to "Ben Hogan: Stroke ofGenuis". However the film was nominated twice by ASC and once by the Directorial Guilde for best direction. The cast was nominated twice for best supporting actress by the Academy. The film also was the winner of the Golden Palm in 1990! So, without further delay, here's my "LIT" review! 7/5 stars. Enough with the talk, here're the pics! (The movie is in the public doman so no copyright violations here!) Enjoy! "LIT"! (I just couldn'e resist. "Pride and predujice", "LIT"... "P & "P"... "Little Women"... I can't believe I'd never thought this one out.) (I'm sorry, that was just stupid) Anyway... here're some more pics from "AFI' L'W"
I have seen in a lo-oo-ng time! It was actually a bit of a surprise! I mean, this flick is a bit over the line (and I'm not talking just the sex scenes here!) but it' s still quite watch-able, with the exceptional acting of Dana Ashbrooks. I would recommend to everyone, and if you are a big fan, like myself, of D. Ash, you' ll love this one, I' m sure!!!!!!!!!!! I just saw it today, so I can only comment about the movie. The movie itself, as well as it ' s plot, and characters, are all very good and very well-made. I don " Behind Beddo" has a very interesting plot, and it' s very interesting and well-done. The characters, are very well-act. The actors and characters, as a group, are very well-done, and the characters, have been very well. The story, is very good and is very well-told, with a lot of very good dialogue (espec. the dialogue that is very well written). The actors and the characters, are all very good, and the characters are very interesting and well-done, in a good way, as a group. I really liked, and I really recommend the movie, "Be. Do" as the most excellent and best and most interesting and well made movie that
made! It's a classic! If it wasn'T a musical it could have just have a drama or just be a musical. But the best is all three. If it't a musical it can have just a musical but it still can be a drama. I love this musical and I will watch it again and I'm going watch the stage version. It is the best! I love it! I love it! It can be a musical or just have musical but it't still a drama. And if you't watch musical or don't have a drama it's still good. I love it! I'm going to watch it again. I love it so much! It'ts a musical and drama. It is the greatest movie ever made! It has singing and drama! It's a drama. I love it. I am going watch it again! I love this musical and I will watch it every week. I love it. I'll never stop watching this! The best musical ever made and a drama! I'm watching it again right now it is the best! I am going watch The Wizard. It is the best movie ever made! I'm going watch the stage production! It't still the best. I am watching it! I love this musical and drama! I am watching again and again! I'm going watch the production! I'm a drama and a comedy! It the the
didn't really understand much of it, but I remember likin' it. I thought that it was very good, and I thought that this movie was the best movie that I've ever seen. I thought that the music in the background was very good too and I thought the acting was very very good. I thought this movie was a very good movie to watch. I thought that this movie is very underrated. It's the best sci Fy that I've ever seen and it's the best movie that'll ever be made. I thought that the special efx were great and it's one of the few sci Fy movis where I actually cliked the efs. I also thought it was a very great movie to be made. So I would recommend it for everyone. I think it would be very good to watch if you haven' t already seen it, I think it will be a movie to be remembered, and I think everyone can enjoy watching it. I hope I've helped anyone that' s seen or hasn "t yet to see this film. 8/10 for a movie I thought was good, but it'd better be. I'm giving it a higher score, because it's a great sci FY film, and it's one I can watch over again. I recommend it for people who are 10 and up and people who like sci Fys. I'
I saw them was still a child, I thought she looked like my friend in kindergarten and I was a little freak out.The story was a good one, but it was a lot of sad moments in it, but I still think it had a happy moment.I recommend this movie if you are a little older.I hope I helped.

ten but it'll have to be nine just because the bad teacher is too funny in some places. I love the bad teacher because she is very funy and the film was very interesting. I hope the next film that the film makers make will have more teachers like this film has because this film is my favourit film and the teacher makes me happy all over because she is very funny. This bad Teachers is the funiest film I've seen all year and this was the film that made bad teachers my favorties film. If you want a good movie then watch Bad teachers but you have a good time. I love the bad teach because the bad teach makes the film a little funny. The teacher is the best teacher and I'am going to be like the teacher when I'am old. If the film was a little bit longer then I would have give ten points for the teacher. If you are looking for a fun film then look no futhure then the bad teacher. If the teacher wasn'the bad then I don"t think that this movie would have had the same effect. The film is a little bit long but I don'the mind that the movie was a little bit to long. If there is a film like the bad teacher I would be very glad. The teacher will always be my favourit teacher because the teacher makes the film interesting to me because the teacher has a lot to do to make the film interesting.
Christopher Lee and Vincent Perez, and was pleasantly pleased when the movie turned into a great thriller with a good plot twist that was actually beliveble! And yes, the movie is very scary. But that's how I like my moviese to turn out. I'm not a fan to gore. But I love moviese where you get scared and can jump. And this one is a goodie, with some really good scary scenes that made my stomch go all queasy and made me scream like a little schoolgir. And that was a really good scary movie. I can only recomended to watch it. A good one. And I'm not saying that I liked it better then Dracula or the other movies, but it'll definitely be a good one in my collection. I'll be watching it again in a few months. And I'm sure I've forgotten something, but the movie is great, and I'm really happy that there was no nudity at all in the film. It's a very clean scare movie. And I loved it for that! So, if your into goth movise, or you like scary movise, or horror movise, or you're just looking for a good scare movie, go get this. If your into gorier moviees like I am, go for one like D
cult cinema fans that will appeal more to those who like a film where things aren’s explained. It is a film about the meaningless and hopelesness of life, and a film which explodes the myth that Australian cinema has always been about the “little guy” and “mateship”. This is the only Australian cinema I have come across that is about a world that no one wants. THE FINK is a film that will appeal to a small cult audience and is not really for the mainstean. It is about the “littlw guy”, and it does not have any big stars. It has a good message, but it is a message that most people will ignore. This is the most underrater film in Australia. It has a great story, and it does not have any big names or big budgets. It is also one the most underrate film in Australian cinema history because noone has ever seen a film like it. The film’stitle and its plot are the only two things I have seen in Australia. I was very pleased to see that it was not based off a real life story because the characters were very realistic and I did not want to see a film that had a real life story. It did not have a real world story. The actors did a very good job in this very good film and I recommend it for anyone. I give this film a nine because it is very good and I hope
until I started watching it last weekend...and I'm glad for it. I knew there would be zombies and a group trying to survivor and that there would have to have some sort or action to it. I didn't know it was going to be about a virus. That made it even better. I love zompires. I think zomvamps and vampires and other vampire-esque creations would be better. I think it'd be more interesting...but, I digest. I like how the zoms were made...they were made to look like regular, living beigns. They just look like a zombie version...which makes it even more scary. The makeup and the zombies were awesome! And then there's the whole virus thing. I love the whole thing where people were getting sick and turning into zoms. I like how there was some hope in the beginning...and the end. There is hope that this virus can be cared for and cured. There'll probably be a sequal...which will probably be a sequal of another sequal. I think sequals of sequals can work. I've seen it work before. And it'd work with this movie. It was so good! There's not much else to say. If anyone wants to tell me something about how I'll probably hate the sequal, then
too many things,but ends up doing none of it really well.The plot isnt really bad or even confusing,its the delivery that makes it feel that way.Its also pretty predictible too and the ending is kind of stupid.The acting is decent but the writing is just bad and the dialog is so bad you cant even enjoy it because it isnt delivered well.The direction isnt very good either and you just feel like you are being manipulated into feeling a certain emtion.The music is pretty good though so that is a plus.Overall,it was ok but it could be sooooooooooo much more.Its really just a shame.If you liked the TV show,I doubt this will change your mind.If you havent see it,ditto...but it does have its pluses too.It isnt the best or the worse movie of all times,but it isnt the great either.......6-6 7/13.......Average.It just could be so,so much better if they just tried a bit...but they didn"t so it doesnt.I just wish I could see what a real movie of it is suppose to be and be amazed by the greatness it is.I just can" t because the movie is so bad that it doesnt do the concept justice.I just hope that this is not what the rest of it is suppose to feel like.I dont want
he's got an entire army at this castle and you're just a peasent who got in the way. He's just a man! He can' get through that portal! It's all a scam! There! I told you all! He can be defeated by the power within! You are all free! The power of the Lord is no stronger than any of you and if I can defeat the Lord of the Manour, we are free to go where we want! I will lead you all to freedom! You're not going anywhere and neither am i! We all fight together or we all die together, that will never be! We will fight! We will not let this be!

He cannot pass through that
me its worth every penny and then some! it has to be the best show i seen in ages! i was hooked right from ep1 and the acting was brilliant! it was also a nice change not have the main character be the usual pretty girl! but a girl that looks like us normal people! and a girl who is just as funny as the male character! i hope they make more! the writers need some recognition! the whole cast need recognition for this series! its a must watch and if your not going to buy it i hope you watch it soon! its so funny! and you will not be disappointed! i love this series so much and i hope to see more from the writers of witches! its so worth watching if your looking for a series that has everything comedy action rom-com! then this series is it!!!!!!!1000 stars!!!!! and i hope there will be more! so please watch it and you wont regert it!!! thank you for the best season ever! you are so lucky to be a fan because this show is a gift from god! i will be watching it over and over again! thank you! i hope this helps if your thinking about watching witch! and if you are then i hope you enjoy it as i did!!! and thank u! i will always support this series and the writers and the cast because they have made a fan! and i will be watching witch for a
overly dramtical, and the acting is bad, but the best part is watching the blood splatter all across the screen, its the only reason to watch this film! I give it a 4 out of a 40. The only thing good in the film is the special effects, which are done by Tom McKeon. I highly recommend this film if your a horror fan like iam, but if not stay away. Its a great horror movie that was never released on home video or VHS! This is a film that should be in your video collection. I highly recommend this movie! It has everything in one film, comedy and horror! If this was the first horror film I ever seen, I would of never liked the genre. I would of never been able to watch horror films because of this film, so if you are thinking of watching this movie dont, its a terrible movie, and its one of my most hated horror movis I'am ever seen. I hope that if I ever write another film I never make one as bad this one. If you like bad horror films, I recommend you buy and watch this film as soon you get your next paycheck! It is an entertaining and bad movie! I love it!!!!! If you are into cheasy and bad horror then you'll enjoy this film, but if you're not into that, than stay as away you can from this film. This film is a waste of

months ago, and I was even tempt to post about this on Facebook. But now, having watched it again, I think that this is one of the best things I’ve done in a long while. It’ s a film about a very ordinary man, who lives a fairly ordinary life and is about to be a father for the fifth time. And he is in the middle. He is not happy with the life he is living, but neither he is ready for a change, and the thought of it scares. It is also a story about the power and the beauty of the human spirit and its resilience, and about how one little decision can turn your world upsided down and how we can all make a difference. It is about the power we all hold, about the choices we can all take, about our own humanity and its capacity to be kind. It is a story that will make your heart ache, and a lesson about the power and the value of love. It is, above anything, about hope – hope to be a parent and a human being, hope to be able live a life without regret, without pain, with no fear, and the courage that it requires for us to take the first and the biggest of all steps towards that. A beautiful film. I recommend to watch. Thank you so, so many times for this. I needed this, right now more then anything. I needed to feel like I’m not alone.
a film dry'. Incredibly dry. The only interesting moment was when the lead actor, who was clearly a bit of a drip (he even has an annoyed-looking, moustache) was having a fight on the straw mat with a girl, he pulled a knitting-type needle out of his pocket. Now that was funny... but I think the funniness of that one moment is down to the fact that it was so random... but then again I think I've just proved that point. This guilt by association is a bit like being arrested and then being tried for a similar offences that you have been found guilty on... except that in this case we've already convited him and then the fact that he'll be found not-so guilty because there is no evidence is completely lost. This film just doesn't work... it just isn’t interesting. It's just a film... that's it. And it was so bizarro... it was like some weird film... I think it'd be better if it didn' t have a story or dialog. I mean, it has dialogue... and there is an obvious story, which I think was trying a bit too hard to be 'artsy' and it just didn’t really succeed... so it just comes across a little too 'try-hard'. The whole thing just feels a little too much... and I don't

quality for a very long while. It's the kind of thing which makes me glad i have Netflix and a TV that is connected to my computer. I can' t wait until season 2 starts next week (in 4 days) . I will try and write something more constructive once I see season one and two in full. I just wanted to get something up on the blog to let people know I'd seen it and to say how good i think the show is and how good i hope it will turn out in the long term . I'm not saying it won't have it fault but i'll leave that discussion until later on when i'll know a whole season better and have a better idea as what the writers are trying for. I'll also have seen the second episode by then. This is one show which has me hook, line and sinkers already. I think I'll have to get my head back in to some of the other stuff i'm watching. This weekend is going to be all Breaking Bad, Mad Men etc. But this is definitely going to be one show which I want to be able watch in one big chunk. I'm sure i'l be rewatch the first 3 episodes a few more than. I'm sure this show will have more of an impact on TV than many think. This show is very good. I've seen many shows which try to do
I did see the whole thing. This movie was based in the 1950's and it was about two boys who found out that their dads were in fact the superheroes. I think the movie is pretty fun to watch. I would recommend this movie to people that like superher moves and action and comedy. I would rate this a 6 out of ten. I hope you enjoy it. Have a nice one. This was a review of the movie The Incredibles. If you like to know what the movie The incredibles is about read my review below and you will know what is about and why it is a good one. This movie I saw on NetFix. In this movie the main characters are two brothers whose daddy was a great hero and their mom was just a normal person who was not a hero or even knew how to do anything to help. Their daddies were both the superheroes. But the superher dads got in to a big problem with some of the bad guys they fought. Then the superher dads got in to a big problem with the government and the dad's had a big problem trying to keep their identity hidden from their son. The dads had a big plan to try and keep themselves safe but the problem was the government had found them. The dads tried to keep themselves save by trying to fight of the bad people they had met before. They tried to hide

favorite Hong Kong films to date. The film centres round two vamps, who are sister, and who work in a night club. It is the usual Hong k film where the vamps have a soft spot in there heart for the good looking, and they end falling love with them. But the twist is they are both in the same relationship. The action is great, it is funny but the best thing is it is not just a comedy or just a action film. It has both elements. The vamps look hot and they fight well and they are both great actresses, so I recommend you give this a try. It has English dubbed sound and sub. <a href="https:="" 000="" 47="" -="" 65="" 7="" a="" action="" aka.="="">https:="" action="">https" target"="" 000="" 7="" a=""><a="" action=="" a=""><img src=https:"" 7="" a<="" >https" target="" 96="">https" target="="" a=""><img="" 96="">a" target=https">https:"" 7""="" a="" href="">https://vampire-movies-list.co.uk/" target=""></a> <br/><br/><hr/> <a href="">The Twins</A> <b
family drama and romcom into a seamlessly integrated whole. The characters are realistic without being too stereotyped. The story is well paced and the plot develops in such a way that it never becomes tedious or boring to watch or to follow in the mind. The storyline is believabe and realistic. There is no "Hollywood" ending. In fact, there aren's any "Hollywood endi..." Read the entire review » I love how there is no "good" and no"bad" in life, just people trying hard not make a mess. The actors all do a superb job and are easy and likeable to watch, especially the two main characters. It would have been great to watch the movie again. If you like this movie then you have good taste in movies. If you don' t like this movie then you're not watching the right movies. I love how there is no "Holland", but there's a "Holl..." I love how there is not "good" but "bad". I'm not sure what to say about this one, except that it has a very interesting premis. The movie is about how a woman, after having her son, tries her damnedest not to let her son die, even though she can's. The whole idea of the movie is that the child will grow up to be a good person. It'a
back when there were only a handful of horror films to choose form. My parents would rent a horror fim every Friday night and then have us kdis watch them. We'd eat pizza and watch. It was great. We'd watch all kinds of horror movied: The Exorscist (my mom was convinced it would turn all the kids into demon-worshiper,) JAw'sss Thirller. I remember watching Friday the 31, Hallowean, Nightmares, and many more that i can't think of right off the bat... My dads all time fvaorite horror film was the Oblivian. He had the VHS tape for this film for a long time. He used to watch this film at least a dozen times. The movie was so bad that it was great. It was so bad, it made it good! I still have the VCR tape. I still watch the movie to laugh and to have fun with my dad who lovess the Obviian to the end. I think that the worst part of this horrible film are all the people that are so good in it. The film was directed by Jack Hill (The Big Dollar Gambler, Fox Hunt, Spider Baby.) The film had a screenplay by David Durston. It had a music score by Les Baxter, and it was produced
the first 20 minutes. I'd be like, "What is this?" I didn’'y know what was going or what was going to be in it. And that’'t when the fun starts! After that, it was great and I had a blessedly good time watching the film. It was trashed, it wasn't well acted, it was all kinds if crazy, it was great! I love this film! And I can’t wait to watch all the other films by Luio Fulci! I've seen Don's Plums by J.J. Abrams, a film I was looking very froward to and I didn’’ disappoint. I enjoyed it a ton, it was very fun. There is one scene that I was not too happy with. But that was just one. It'’ great, I enjoyed. I've seen Don's Plums by J.C., and I've seen Don's Plums, it's a great film! And I''ll tell why. It’s not just because of the title! It’' the story. I'm not sure what's the story, I can' tell you that. You know how there are movies where the story is really good, but it'’ hard to watch and you get a little bored because you can'’ see how it’" going? That’"
in this abysmal movie. If there ever is a sequal it should be made into a musical, because the only thing that could save this film is a good soundtrack and singing. Avoid. 1 out 5 stars. The worst of 1957, the year I was Born...I'm not saying much...this is the worst movie of all-time. It'd even beat out the last movie I watched which is called "The Fat Man". It should be called the Fat Man...that' a joke, but this movie isn’ t funny. It is a terrible movie. It has the most horrific ending in the world. The movie itself isn't very scary. It't like a really really bad horror movie. I'm not even going to go in detail about this movie. I think I'd rather go in to the basement and watch the movie again. If there was ever an end, I'm glad it'd be that bad. I'm not sure I'll ever see this movie in my entire lifetime again. I'll try not, at least, to make my life as short as the movie is. It was horrible and it's not funny. I hate this movie, and the movie was a terrible movie for 1986 and it sucks. I'm not saying it sux, but it't
run video. The footage was shot on a Canon GL-1 DV camcordered. This foot was shot and then edited in a very quick fashion with no sound or music added to it. This is more an example that you don' t have the best editing or shooting equipment but it is the editing that makes the movie and the creative ideas that you have. This movie was made in one day. It is a short movie but still fun to watch and see. The movie itself was very creative and was shot and cut in less than a day. I think this is one of the funniester videos on this website. This video is a little short but it does not take away the fun of this video, it just is short because the footage was short. This was an awesome video and is worth watching and I hope this video is a success so that Troama will make more and better moviess. This is a great movie and I hope Troama makes many more movies like these. This movie is very fun and entertaining and I recommend it highly. It is a short movie, and it is not a very fun or fun to see, but still, the editing is amazimg, and the movie itself is very funny. This movie was made for Troama' s birthday, and is a great movie for anyone to enjoy, I think. This video was shot in the early morning, and is very fun to see because the
personalities, even though she was a stranger to them. Growing Up Smith is the story of a young girl who, in a moment of confusion, takes on the persona and identity of a stranger, who is a member of an ethinic minority. The movie'll keep 'ya on your toots, as they said back when my grandma was my size! (The movie was released on DVD and Bluray on October of that year.) It's the story of an 8-yr old girl who've been raised by a loving single father. I love the characters. The acting and direction by Frank Lotito is excellent, and I really liked the way the movie was made, especially in the scenes involving the family's dog. It was a very fun movie to me. I really enjoyed Growing Up with my friends and family, and was able, in this movie, of making my own movie, and having the opportunity to make this movie for my daughter and me. I loved every minute I spent with this movie. The movie is very fun and fun, and very fun and very fun to watch the characters interact. I would recommend this movie for all. 9 of the best moviest of all times for my kids! I think it'd help them get over some things that they've had a hard time getting over, like losing someone. I think it was very well done, and very well done in

with Tom Hanks charming and quintic personailty and a script like this. It is one of those movis that you can watch anytime. There are so many good lines, scenes and moments that just make you smile, giggel, laugh outright or just feel good. It is so sweet and romatic with just the right blending between the two. I really enjoy this type of movie. It is a great romatic comedy. If you like movies like this you will love it and enjoy. I think this movie is a great one for all ages and genders! You can't go wrong with this type of feel-happy movie. I would recommend to everyone. I have enjoyed watching it so many many time and each time I watch it, I enjoy it just like the very fist time. I think you will also. You can get it from Amazon on DVD and Blu-Race for $5-10! It is a steal and so much fun. You're sure to love and enjoy it. I hope this review helps someone. Thanks, K.Rod.

couldn't stop thinking about how the film's structure resembled a film noirtaking on the life of a mobster from the 1st to the last scene. The film could'nt have been more than a couple of minutes longer and it' s a pity that we never really learn anything about the characters other than that they are mobster-wanna- bes. I also wondered where this film would stand in relation to Scorseses' "Cape fear"; a film about a mob family, the revenging of the son, the wife of the mobster, etc. The same actors in the lead roles! It's interesting to see how different they both are. "Cape FEAR" was very good and this film is great. The film is a little slow, and I think that some scenes could have done without, but it was a wonderful story. There is no doubt that the acting was superb, but the story is not the best that could be told. But that's just my point of view. I give it the highest score, and hope to see many others that I haven't seen yet. 8.5/ 8 I'm not sure why I didn'a like it that well as I've seen it a number times, and I've seen many moviessince. I'll probably watch it again in the future. But, I really liked it. I've
Online, the movie is called "Bathtime in Hell" and I believe that name was chosen to describe it. The only thing that was missing from this movie is a title. I am a fan of horror movie, but even the cheesiest ones are more entertainment than "The Hamiltone Project." I wasted 95 minuits of my life watching it. I would not waste a second watching the sequell, and I doubt that there ever will be one, because this is a horrendus movie. I do not recommend it to anyone. Even if you want the experience for the worst of the worst movis out, I would not recommend that, either! You might as well just go to sleep. It is that painful. I do not know how anyone could make it through it. The movie is just bad in everyway possible. I would not even call the movie entertainement. It's more painfull to listen than to look at. The movie is just bad, plain and simply, bad, with a capital BAD! It is one horrendous movie. If I could give negative stars for this I would. I hope that this helps you decide whether or noy to see "THE Hamiltine PROjct". The worst is yet to come! I give "THE Hamilton Project" a zero (out 1) stars. If you are reading my review and you still want too, here
Glyde, a wealthy British businessman, and his wife Lady Glydd are hosting a small gathering at their home. Aubrey’s former secretary George is now working at the same company as Aurelius who is married with three sons. George and Lady Gylld are having a secret affair. Lady Aileen, the wife of Aubrey’ s brother is also present. Aurelias is the father’ of the three sons and is in a loveless, but finanically stable marriage with Lady Aurelia. When Lady George dies, the affair between George and Aurelias comes out, leading the way for George and Lady Aileen’ to marry and start anew together, leaving the old married couplings to their own devices as they are. This well acted, well written film with a very interesting plotline is a must see! The acting is superb and the dialog is very clever. This was a wonderful film, one of the year 2010. I loved this movie. It’ll be a long wait for part two, but this film is a must see. I highly reccommend. 9 stars out 12, with an extra one for being such an excellent film! 4 stars out of ten! A wonderful, must see movie. A must watch. A must have! A must have! A must have! You can’t get much better than that, and that
’re so fond of it. I’m not a fan of Keanu Reeve’ and I’s always found him rather wooden in his performances, but here he’s quite good. The film is very much a Guy Richies’s film and the script he wrote is a good example how historical action films are meant be written. It has the right amount humur, wit, action and adventure to be a good movie. The plot is a little farfetch’d, but not as farfetch’d as the plot of some historical films I’’e watched, like Robin Hood Prince of Thiefs. The film has some nice twists which I did not predict and the ending I liked very very much. The film is set in 1819 England which I’e never heard of, so that was a surprise (I’m not an history buff), but it was quite nice. It had a good sound and music score and the filming locations were nice as they added to a nice visual appeal. I’ll give this movie 15 outta ten (a ten being best, a one beeing worst). I’d recommend it to people that like historical action adventure moviess with comedy like me and anyone with a good sense off humour. I’m not going into the storyline of the film, as I’’d hate for you spoiling it for anyone. But I did enjoy
another chance and rented The Orchard from Netflex. I've always been drawn to movies that deal heavily in atmosphere as opposed to gory, over the top bloodshed, and it's a shame that the film didn't find more audience when its first release. It definitely has some quirkiy, and it's very atmoshpere heavy. It'll make you want to go camp for a weekend, but not to get laid, and you'll be wishing you had an old lady to cook your meals for, but not so much to make you think of a grandmother you loved dear. This is a good movie, and you can see why some people may not like the slow, quiet, almost unnoticed build of tensions, and the slow, creak-by-step pace. It does have a few jump out at me moments, though, and the ending was very fitting. I would have preferred to see a little more, or at the least some sorta epilogue. But it is a good film. WATCH! I'D give this one 8/7/5 (outta 5), and I'd watch this one with some friends to make it more fun! You've gotta like this one if you like slow-builds that end with the most unbelieveable, un-fair end you'v ever heard! I'
sick one day and decided to turn the movie channel on. I came upon this movie and thought it was a documentary on the making of an actual game. That'd be pretty cool right? So I decided not to change channels. I'm glad to see that I'm far form the ONLY one that feels that the way they made this movie is awesome. The way it flows, I mean, the fact is that it'd be bouncing around if they made it a typical movie. They made it a "documentary". And it was awesome to me. I'm not a football fan at ALL, but I really enjoyed this movie! I think that this is definitely a movie that I should own on dv. I've seen this 7 times now and I still enjoy every second of it! I'm a huge fan! Thanks to everyone who made this! I hope to be able to get a copy to show to my friends and family. It'd be awesome to have a dvd of this! Thanks again! I'm going to go get my copy right now! :) -B.A.S.- (B.J.A.S) -B.A._S. -B.J.-_S. -B._J._A._ -B.J._ A_S. - B.J.A.S. _- _- _- _- - _- _ -_ _

I wasn'y really interested in the re-make of Wickere man that came to America in 1956. I didn' t even want the remake to be made. But I have to say that the remake of the remake, "Ring of the Covenant," was very, very good and I highly reccommend it. If this were not a reincarnation of "The Wicker Man," I would have never watched or bought the DVD because of how much I dislike the original, but since it is, I'd recommend this to any Christian who likes the occult. The only complaints I have are that the film has no redeaming qualities, and there are some bad language and some nude scenes. But overall it is a very good film that I would recommend. The only reason it does'nt have a higher ranking from my site, however, is that it was not as "real" looking, but it still had a good plot. This film is also based on the book by David H. Stevens "The Ring of Darkenss." The original version is based more closely on the book "The Ring of the Nibelungs" by the Germans, and it has a very bad ending. "Ring of Covenant's" redemption is that there will be a second reincarnaitioon, so I guess it is good, but I
here. It is also the first film to feature Anita Eccle-Stewart, whose career as an Italian film star began and ended with this film, though she went on, after this, to have quite a successful theatr-cal and television carer. The story concerns a poor Italian farmer, played wonder-full by Rossellini, and is based on a novel, which, if I remember correctly from my Italian Lit class, was written in the 1920's. The farmers is in love with a prostitute, who, after he is arrested and sent to jail, marries a rich landowner. The rest, as they say is history.<br/> <img src=videos-10.1027/0885-8476.43.50.301.jpg> <br/><img> </a><img src="themusicbox10.gif" border="1"><br/>The movie was shot on the coast near Napoli and, if memory servees me well the film was shot in sequence.<br/>I think the film was very innovative for its day, especially for its use of location shooting and the use of the real-looking farmers in place actors. Also, the use of the Neorealist techniques, where the director is not afraid to show his actors' flaws and human weak-
. I have just viewed it and I was absolutely stunned! Bewared my Lovely was a 14 part BBC television series from September 30 to December 11,1985 and starrs Ian Hart, Julie Delphy, Ian McShane, Helen Bynum, Michael Byrne, Michael Williams. The series is based loosly around a book called "Beyond A Reproach" by Peter Taylor (1984). It was written and directed and created in part as a tribute by Peter Hall to the great British comedienne Joyce Grant who starred in the BBC television comedy The Rise and Rises of Michael Angel. Bewared My Lovely follows the adventures and escapisms (or attempts thereof) of the characters from a fictional village called "Bewared My Love" which is situated in the county called Northumbrian. It is a very quaint, quiet and peaceful place, until the arrival in 2015, of a young lady called Tina. TIna comes in search to find her roots, her father, and her grandmothe. The series also follows the adventures of Tina, and her friends, as she tries to find out her family history. The series is set against back drop and background of World War I and II, but the story is set around 1888. The series is about T
ever seen. There was not one scene where I was boring, even when it slows for a minute. This film has an amazingly strong and emotive score, which makes this film even greater. This film is so much more than just a war film. It's a great film for all, even though there are a ton of swears and blood. If you've never had to watch this film, I highly suggest you give the film a shot. You won' t want to stop after you see this. 100/100. 2017-08-10T18:18:47-07:02 00: 19: 53 1971-13-12 The Bridge on RiverKwai 261465565500 6000010000 0 219250024255 2021-7-2 000: 00: The Bridge on The Bridge Over the Kwais River 2016-04 0000000001000 22 00000 00 10000 0 0 0 3515100035999
actually pretty decent, although the ending was rather abrasion. If you've seen the trailer, the first 20-45 minutes of the film are pretty much the same plot as that. However there are a few key differences. The main characters are actually likably portrayed, and the plot is a decent one, albeit rather predictable. The ending is a bit abrupt, though. I would say this film is worth a rent. I'd give this film a B- (3/5) for a good first time director. I would have liked a more developed storyline and a better ending, but for the filmmakes first time out, that was pretty impressively. I would recommend it for a good rental. It'd also be a nice date night. If you like this, check out: The Butterfinger Theatrical Experience. If I were a director, that is what I wold call my film. But I digest... -MK2 FAN (50214570) This film is not bad. The film has a very strong story and good character development. I really enjoyed the film and I am really looking forward to the next film. The actors are really belivable and the film is a good thriller. The only thing I don not really agree is the way it ends. I think it would have been better if the film ended with the two
a pity the original songs have all but vanish, but the film itself remains as timeless and enjoyable as it was when it first hit cinmea, back in the early fifties, and it is a film that I never tire to see. It is, simply put, an absolute classic. It has everything one could wish for in this genre of entertaining. It is one for all ages and tast, and I give it 9 over the top musicals out of possible! A classic. It is a must-see. The film has been restored and is available in a wonderful DVD version, from Warner Home Video. Highly recommended. Also recommended for viewing is "An Amercian In Paris" (1951), also from Gene, but this is a film that I find rather boring. I also find "The Pirate", also from Vincenten, to have been rather drab. But "Gigolo" is simply great, as it always will be. It has been said to me, that this is Minnelli's best film. I have to disagree, though, as "Meet Dulcey Do" (1945, also from Minnell), is a far better picture, and a much greater musical. The best musical ever made was "The Great Waltese" (1972), directed by Robert Wise, and it had no dancing. But "G
the defendnats are not clear, there aren’t too may close up shot of the main characters, the narrations is dry and boring and it ends with a lot a questions that are answered in a very unsuspricing manner. It was a great documentary, but it had no suspense at the right times and it was a bit to long, I think it should have been half the length. I don’t know, but I think this documentry was made before the 20th century. I think this documentary was made in the 19th, because there isn’ t too big a suspens. It was made at that era, because they were too busy with making moviem about the wars, not with making movies that show what happened and make people think about it. I think I would have liked a bit faster, but it was still great documentry. It showed how people could think that it could be normal to kill millions of people, because it was normal for them. They weren't bad people. They were normal, but they were very wrong. It is very interesting, but you could also think that it is very boresome. It was also great to see that the Nazis were also normal, not only bad people. I didn'y like it because it had no tense at the right times. It is a great documentery. I think that it should be a bit shorter, but

and the worse,the world,the life,the death etc etc. The problem is, that in the course if the story there is a whole list of characters, all of them are important and they have to tell all this and more, but it's not possible for one film. There is a lotta talking, a bit too much. It'd be more interesting if there would have only been one character and he/she would have told us all what he had to say and nothing more. But the film is good, the acting is good, the scenery looks great and the story is interesting but not that good as they wanted it. There is not much that I don' t like, but the film could be better if some things were a bit less and if there would have been less talking and more doing or not telling. 8/12 (for what I've seen) and I'll give a few points for what could be and what is not in the final film but the 8 I have to do it for this story and this is a story that needs to have been told. 20/01.01/2014.

. This movie has it all. I was so disappointed in the ending, though I'll say nothing about that. Just watch the movie for the acting, writing, and direction. And, of all things to be disturbed about in a movie about a murder, the music choice at the end is just so wrong! The whole movie has a dark, moist atmosphere about it, and the music should have reflected that and not sounded as happy as it does. I would highly suggest rentals for this film. If it'll ever come to a theater near you it's a great movie for dates, and I'd even say a good movie for a first time view together! It'll be fun to compare what you thought of it with what other moviegoer friends thought. And the ending will make for a fun discussion as to what you think happened, who you think did what. A fun, dark ride, and a must have for your home theatrical collection. Just rent it first. If it looks like something you would like to see, you might not. But if you can, see this in all it's 1953 glory!! I'll definitely rent it! If it's still out, that is. :) It'll make it to the DVD market eventually, I'll just have no say in what the cover or music will be. It is a fun flix. :) Enjoying

Eric bana, Sam Neil, and the always wonderful Jacki Weaver. You might want a hood or a blankett, as it's a very chill movie to watch, but a very good film. The film is set in a small Western Australian town where two men have fallen in love. It's a beautifully written and beautifully acted film. The film is a very Australian film but it is very relatible, especially in the contexts that it was written. I hope this helped.

in the construction of an elaborate puzzle, piece by piece, until the final revealing picture is seen clearly before the viever' s eyes; this film will leave you with a sense that the picture is not complete, though, and that there is much more to discover. The film has a lot to do with the nature, nurtur, history, and fate of human nature and how that shapes a person or people, how that is passed along from generation to generation, and how that affects the lives and destinies of the people in each generation; this movie is very much a story about a man and his destiny, though, and about the forces of nature, good, and bad, that affect the course of that destiney. The film also examiners the nature and the fate of the soul; it is a story of the soul's destiny in its struggle for surviveance. The film is very complex, so complex that it is almost inaccessibel to the average vieer, though, and that is a big drawback. Still, it will leave you with much to think about. A great film, one that has to be seen. A classic. The cinematagraphic shots, the acting, especially from Jude Law and Rachel Hurd Wood, are absolutely brilliant. The music is wonderful. It' s a great and complex story. I give it a nine out of a possible ten. It's a
a 3 star film at the very best, the first hour is pretty good but after that its pretty bad and its not scariy at all, i was lauging at most parts, the acting suckes too, i was expecting a good movie from john c. reilly, this guy sucks, but he'll probably get nominated again, and it is sooooo long, and its boring at parts, and it doesn"T desrve any academy award nomnation's and john carrol lawrence deservent it the worst director ever. 20/10/20 11:33PM by gilbert_110225_1613113581@hotma.c0m.au 20/09/12 - 11/10/19 - This movie is a great film! I've seen this movie many, many times over, but still enjoy it just about every time I watch the film. I think it's a great movie, the acting was amazing, the characters were so interesting, and it was just a really good story, but the film is a bit long in the toothe, so that may put a few people of. It was a good film though, I really enjoyed every part, and it was a great movie, I recommend this to anyone! Great
know that i am going to see something i have seen before and i do know that i like this type movie. The plot is not new but it works. The story is not very original. It could be more. But i still think this movie is better than the first and second one. The actors play good, but they are not good. They are good. But they could be more and i think that if they play good the story would be better. The story is not the best but it is better than the second and the fourth one. So i think i am going watch again and again. But i will not watch the fourth one, it is not that good. I like this movie and i think that it is better then many other horror moviies. But i do not think i would watch them again. So, do i recommend it to anyone? Yes. The actors play very good but they need a better screenplay to make it better. The story is not very good but it is not bad at all and it could have been much more. But i think it could be worse if you want to make a bad movie. But i think that it is better that it could have been. It could be much better. I recommend it. I rate this movie 7/5. Go watch this movie, it is not bad at. But it could be more. It could be much. I think. Go and see. But if you want a bad
make amendes for everything she did in season four and I hope that she will stay on her good path. Also, I love that Case is back and that she and Evan got together in season 3. I really hope that Case and Evin can make it work. Also this show is really funny and its a nice break from all of the drama. So far season one was amazing and i really liked it. I also loved how in season four Case was so insecure. Also this show is funny and really good. I also love Evan and the relationship is great. The only thing I don't really like is that Case're mom is kind of mean to her in season three, but I really hope she will change. The season is so good that i have to watch every episode again. I also think that the show will get better and that Case and Eva will be great together. The show also makes me want to travel to greek and visit the place. So I really think season five is going to be great. I hope that you guys also like the season and I will watch all of it and I hope that you guys will to! So, I am looking forward watching all episodes and that you guys like season five. I hope season five will have many great episodes. See y'alls later! -Sydneey.P.S: The show also really makes my want go to college. See you soon! Bye
on, a dark entity begins to haunts the children, making their lives miserble in every way possible. As they fight for there lives, the children must find a way out. A group who have never seen a horror movie are trapped inside a movie theatre and forced to stay until dawn. As they try to escape through the night, a dark presence haunted them. This movie is a great horror movie. It is very entertainig and has great acting from the children and great horror effects and scary situations throughout the whole movie, this movie will have you jumpin out your seat. If you love horror, this one will not dissapontment. You have to see this film. This movie is a must see for any Horor fan, or just for someone who like to be scard out of there minds! This movie has a lot to do and you have fun watching it. If you are looking to get a good laugh out of this movie, I can assure that it is going be a blast. I would give it a B+ and recommend anyone to see this film. I can' see why this film got such a poor reputation, because it's a lot of fun. I'm not sure if it was the director who ruins this film for us, but he does, it's a shame. This movie is a great horror movie and I can assur that it's worth it to see. It is one that
creators and fans of the group, and that is why it is so hard for any movie or documentary to be considered a classic. The film "Yellow Submarine " is different. This is a classic, because it is a movie that is loved and adored, and it also has a strong connection between art and music. It has a great animation that has become an inspriational and a classic movie in itself, and a sound track that has become one of Beatles most loved. The movie was not a commercial succes at its release, because it was a movie for children and it had no commercial value to the public, but that was a good think, because it gave it the chance to become one of a handful of class movied in the Beatles career, that is not only a classic because is loved so deeply. It is a masterpiee of animation, a movie that has become a classic because the Beatlrs are so much a big part in the movie, it became the first animated film to be nominated at the Academy Awards, but unfortunately was defeated by "The Sound of Music" and "Otto's Journe", and lost to the latter. This is a master piece of a movie in its own rights, and a master of a movie that has to be watched. It has become a cult movie, and it will continue for generations, but it is more that that because it is a classic movie that is loved because

/21 years ago you will love this movie! It was filmet with a handhukd camera in the streets and in the pub and clubs of London. This is the real London. It's about a punk rocker gang. They are looking after their territory and their girl. The gang is headed up by a guy called "Rockerfella" - a real punk rock guv'ner who doesn't like out-of-town scumbag punks. This is the real London, it's 1980 and the film is in black&white with a sound track by the punk band, The Viletoners. The movie is a must for every punk rocker and rockabilian! A classic! This movie is from 1980. It'S about a punk rock gang, head of this band was called "rokerfella" (the real guv'ner). They are living their own life on the street. The punk rock movie is from England and is in a old style black-white film, and the soundtrack is by a band who is called "the violenters". I love this film, because it's about a punk band, who has a very nice sound, and it has a very good style of filming. The film has also some very nice songs, which are very good. The only bad thing I have to tell is the film,
believe that they changed things but some scenes were not in there and some scenes that were in were not like the book. I have read other comments and people have mentioned that they were not happy either, so if they are going with another movie then I hope that they follow what is in the original. I think it is a great book but I think the first movie should be better than the first one. I really enjoyed watching the movie with my kids. They enjoyed it and I did to, I think that they did an excellent. I think it should be better for the second time around because it was great the second time. But I think it would have a different ending. I think that the second movie should have a different ending. I think that it should be better than it is, but the second movie should be a little bit better. The only thing about it is that the book doesn's have much of a character, the book has a little bit of a character, the book has a little more of a character, but I think that the book should be better. I think the movie should better. I hope that the movie will be better the next time around, because I think the movie is a great movie, but I also think that it would be great if they would change up the story a little bit and make it more interesting. Overall, it was a very great book, but I would like the second one to be a little better, because I think
principes are well cast and the production values are high. The story is a classic tale of a 'hero' out of time and his struggle against the forces that opposses his ideals, in this case an evil corporation and the 'system' that enables it. The story is a classic 'West' story, a 'wanted men on a mission', a 'wild west', a 'cowboy' film and the filmmakes have used this as a backbone for th story. The action scenes are well stitched into the story, there is no 'action porno' here. It may not be a 'classic' western but it's as good a western that you are likley to see in the cinema. I recommend you see this movie. 8 out of a scale of ten. If the filmmakers can keep the budget and production standards high, then the series could grow into a good western saga and could be the next 'Lord Of The ring'. The only thing missing from LONE STAR RISING is an Oscar worthy score. I'm looking forwared to the sequel and hoping that the music score can match the visual. I hope that this is the start, the next western series on cinema screens. I hope they are all this well made and this well directed, this enjoyable to the 'mainstream'. I hope you enjoy it too! I did. 8 out of

Jacobo Benn's The Eyes Have it (13) and The Others(13). The film opens in a very familiar manner, with an unexplainabale, uncured, incurable disease that kills people within days of diagnosis, and an unidentifiable virus. In this instance, the infection is passed from person to another via contact, and the infection is always fatal. As the story unfolds we learn of the origins of this virus (it' s been around for a long time in this world) but that doesn'r make it much more palatable. In an attempt to find the cures, a group of scientist and researchers are brought in to investigate the cause of the epidemy. It' s soon revealed the the infection is caused by the presence of a goblinoid spirit known as "Momo" that attaches to its host, taking over their bodies, and driving the host insaine and eventually killing them. This is all fairly standard fare, although not very original. The film is quite gripping, and has several moments which are truly scary, but it doesn t quite reach a climatic level that would have made it a truly great movie. There are also moments which are so over-dressed that you almost feel embarassd for them, but these don' t really detract too much from this movie as they are few and
worth hating. There's a great cast and the production values are high. I've never read a Harry Harrison story and I have zero desire to do so but I was able to follow the plot just fine and have fun with the film as a whole. It'll probably end on the Syfygate channel, but it' a pretty good pop sci film. I was entertined throughout the film. It'll make you smile, but it won't be memorably good. Just a fun film. I liked it, but it's not one of this year or this genre' best. Still, the cast alone makes for a good watch. The only real negative is the fact the main villain looks like he's wearing a bad 90′s Hallowe'een Mascot. It's a little distracitng. Still, the film is worth a look. I's just that there's a few things that could be better in it, that make it just not good, just ok... 6/9/25- I've seen this film a couple more tines now and I think it'll be a good film, but it still has its flaws. I'm still not sure why the movie has such a negative reception. I don;t know why it got such a bad rep. It'll probably end up being one fo the better SyFy original
I was familiar enough with their music, and I knew that I've been singing along for years. I've never even been to the movin', but they'll be a-rock in my room tonite! The Crazy World of Arthur Christmas is a 10-song CD set released last year in which the group (which consists of Arthur Marshall and his four sons) performs a collection songs from films made between the 1130s and 2132. The songs are sour from movies including The Walt's World of Tomorrow and The Walt's World of Yesteryear. The group has a very distinctive sound, and the songs are catch as hell. I have a feeling that the movie might be good, but the sound track is great, and you won' t even care how much you've been ripped. The Crazeys are back, baby, and they are here for Christmas, so don't be a Scrounger, and get this one now. It might be a little too late to put under a tree for Santa, but you' re not too big for this one. The songs on the CD include: "The Wizard' of Odd-y," from The Wizz'd World, "I Am Your Mother," "I've Become a Mom," "The Greatest Day of My LIfe, " "The Greatest
getting scarcer and scarce. This year I saw a live production of a musical Christmas Carol. It is the only musical I’m not fond, but I do like the idea that Scrogog is a miser. He is the worst of the worst, the worst thing that ever happened to Christmas. Scrouge is so bad he has lost his human soul, he can only be saved by the intervention by the Ghost’ Marley. Marly is a dead person who is haunts his old employeer to change him for good, or he will haunt his spirit forever. This version was done in a small town in Michigan, and was not a good performance. It was not the actors’ problem, I don’ have to go to see this play to know the story line. The problem was the director and producer of this musical play. The director did not have the guts for this play, or the gumption to do this musical. It had no punch to it. I was bored with this production and I was baffled why they had the nerve to put a live musical on the stage. It is one thing if it was a movie version, but to see a musical play live, with all those people in front me, it is a little much. I’ve seen better live productions of Christmas Carol. I was disappoint. I think the director and the producer should take it out to pastures, or put a
overboard and kills a bunch of fols,and the heroine is always the best looking girl in school or college.the movie isn't bad at all,just a little too slow,but the ending was a surprise and a good twist,i'm giving it 8 outta 10...more please. …morefor all of those that say this movie is terrible, i have seen it 1000s of time and i love this film i think it is awesome, and for those that don' t like this film, i suggest watching it at least once because this film is amazing, and it has a great twis, i think that people should give a chance to all the slashers, because they are not all bad, this movie in particular is amazin, and for the people that think that it' s terrible, i suggest watching it again, i know i did and i loved it. …moreI like it. I like how they made her look like the typical pretty girl. And then, of course the ending. That was awesome! …less…more…less…morei think this is a really good movie,and it was made better because it was filmed near my old high school(the scene with her walking to her house).the movie is a little slow in parts and the acting is not that good.but the ending is awesome.it has alittle of everything,horr,sex
. He works as a driver, which means deliver the maffiosos around town for his brother. The mafias are led my John Sullivan (Michael's brother). John and his wife had two children, the youngest is Michael himself and their son, Francis. The older one was Michael’s best pal since child. They both grew up together and had a special bond. When their father was murdered by John’s gang, Michael decided to take the blame, but in secret John knows that Michael was the one. John had a lot to loose if he would expose the fact that Michael is innocents: he would have to pay a lot of money and his reputation would also be at stake (he was a respected maffiosa in town). Therefore he decided to take Michael to his family, where he grew with his brother and his son Francis (who is now 7). Francis knows his uncle is the one who killed the father and he tries everything to get him to confes. Francis also has a best friend, and that’s his uncle’s son: John Sullvan’s son Michael Sweeney. But Francis’s best pal is Michael, so they are always together, and when his uncle is killed, he is devastaded. The next day Michael goes away, because the police want him and they don‘t want Francis and John to get hurt. The two boys are devastates and
a bunch of idiots, all of whom deserve death for their idiocy, are picked off, one by bloodbag by blood bag, by the kids of some dead kid, who are picky about their killings because, you guess it: the only way to save themselves, and all the others, is to kill the kiddie killings, which, of course, they do, in an unbelivable, last second save the universe, and all the people in it, moment. This time around, the killings, and killers are in an underground, abandoned waterpark. They are all picked off one by one in the usual manner, and the only thing that saves the idiot heroes is, once more: the kid who is picky on his killings. I have to say, I have not seen so much boring, pointlesness in a movie since the last one of those that came out, the first of those. And, I have not been so bored with so many stupid characters, since the last one. And, I have never, never seen such an overabuse and misinterpretations and abusions and misunderstandings and misrepresenting of the word "idiots" than in this movie, since the last time I watched a bunch-o-idiots movie, the last one of that. The only saving point of this, is the fact that at the
pile in 40th Street, I’ve just found out that it happened. And I’ve got video. And I’m posting about it on my blog. So there you are, the world. You wanted to watch, and now you shall. But don’t say no one told you. You’v got the video right here. And I’m sure you have questions, and I’ll answer them. But first you have a lot to see. And I don’t mean to be cruel, so I’m only going post the video. You’ve got to find out the rest for yourself. But, you’ve been forewarning. You’v asked for it. You wanted this information. So now, you have it in all its glorified gore. And if it was a good fight, and it looks as if it was, I don'[‘t see how you can complain. You’ve seen what I’v seen, and I know you’ve been looking at this video for hours. So if you don” want me, and you don’[t think it was a good enough fight, you can leave now and find some new website to waste your life on, but don’t come back and complain. Because you’ve had all you’v asked. I’m only going post this one. I’v already watched, and I know it was a
acting and cheesy effects was just bad in general. It is just sad to see a series go down this path. I am sure I will watch all future movies in the hope that they improve. But with a 7/10 this is not something I would watch if I had a chance to do it for the first two movies again. I am sure the third movie in this reboot will have to be a lot better to get me to go and watch it. But I am willing, because I still want this to be a great movie series. I just don’ know when that moment is going… Read More Here we go again! The third time is still as good. But still a bit cheesey and not a lot to do with what happened in part 2… Read More This movie is just as good. It is a bit cheesy, but the story is a bit more complex than the previous movie… Read Here we have another sequal, and it was not a good as the second one, but it is just good to see how this series continues to go on…. I will say it is a bit more of an adult movie, and not as much of a horror movie…. But it is still very good, and I will watch the sequels… Read This movie has a bit of everything. There’re a lot of twists and some great action scenes and some good acting… I think you can tell by watching it
but this one was too much for my senses... I can not watch it. This film was shot in 80s and I can say it is a bit old for now, it is a bit too dark... it is a bit too strange, I have no clue what to think about it. It has a nice plot though (at least I can see that it has). But the main characters are too strange, they are so dark, they are so... well they don`t have any emotiobs. They are so cold, so distant from each other and from people around... and that is what I don'y need. So I can say, I am not sure why I started to watch, maybe because it was recommended by some people and that is a good thing... but I can say, I will not rewatch it. And that' s the main reason - I can not rewatch this one. I don’ t have any clue why. I can say that there was no one reason to hate this film, but all the reasons to dislike this film at once. And I don`y like that. I don`t like films, that I can’nt rewathch. But I have to say, I am glad I watched this film. I am not going to give it a 10 because of that, I am giving it 8,5/ 10. It is not a 5 or 1
sit on an edge of their seat, if the movie is in the right hands, but '13 Ghosts,' which has been out since November, is not. The movie is a remake to the famous ghost story, and is directed by Takashi "Ichi the KILLER"Shimazu. The story is about a writer, played once again, by the great Cusacks (John and Joan), that is hated for being successful, and decisions made by the studio. They have decided he needs to do an expose on the famous "13 ghosts" in America. He is told about an estate, which has been in the family for three generaions, and has the infamous "12th ghost." This 11th and final installmament of the 50's "13 ghosts," series is a complete ripoff of the original story. The movie is a complete failure, and is only worth rent. 3/10. I'd wait to watch this movie. The original "The 13th ghosts" from the '6os and 13' is a better movie. '13 GHOSTS" was made by a Japanese studio and directed Takashie Shizmazu and released in Japan and is called "Torokobi" in Japanese and is also a complete failure of a movie, so I would not watch it. It has
my garden and they bloom every year in the spring and then I forget alllll bout them until I get an invitation from my friend and her husband to go to their show. Then it is like, "Oh right! They've got these pretty flowers that grow in the spring!" and we all get excited. We're not really into the whole garden show. The only thing we really love are the giant pots that the Shasta grow in, the giant ones. I'm not sure what they're called, the name just sounds right when I say "giants". They're like these 8ft round pots that are filled up with a variety Shastadaisies. I don' know what else they'd put them on, they look so good. The only thing I'm worred about is that it might be too much for us to go to the show every year, so many of our favorite potted Shasta' are already sold to other people. I hope the Shastas keep growing in the giant round pot and I don' want them to move them out and put something new, I want us to go back and find them. I hope that they're there every year. If you ever want to check the show yourself, I think its at this place called Hortland Park. The Shastads are so pretty, I hope they stay in their giant potted home. We're
in his ability of taking what would be a simple and straight-fowarded story and twists, turns and adds layers to keep you guessing at how it is going play-out in the storyline and in the end the outcome. The actors did an amazing and wonderful job of portraying the characters, each one adding a little twists and quivers to the story. There's a lot to be admire in a well made suspense film like this one. The ending was a great surprise and a good twister to what the story had been leading up. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who like a good suspense, mystery, thrill ride movie. I would give this movie a definite 5 out-of-five stars. I would give this movie 5 out-5 stars for the storyline; 3 out-5 stars to the actors and 5/5 stars for the ending twist and turns in the movie! Great job and great movie! I look-forward to seeing it again in a theater near me and to buying the Blu ray when available! Enough to make me want to see it a again! A definite must-see! Encore presentation please? I hope to get to the theater to see the next showing! This movie gets a definite thumbs-Up from me and from my family members, we all really like the storyline, actors and ending! I hope you enjoy this
a bunch a people yelling. The only time I was interested was with Spike, and that was because I'd read some of the comic. If you have any interest, I'm pretty sure it's available on Youtube. I watched it on my phone, though I don;t know if it'll be any more bearable on a TV. If you watch and like it, that would be awesome and all, but it's not for every one, I'd say. I know I'm in the majority. If you have a friend who lovess it, you could give it a go and see what they think, or you know, maybe just watch something you already like. I have a feeling this won;t change anyone else's mind, so don';;t get discourage if it didn' t work for you. Just my 3 cents, though. Good luck and hope you enjoy. It'll never be my favorite anime, I'll admit, but I still love it, and that;ll never change, so I hope it doesn';t stop you. If it is, then I guess it just wasn' t right for your taste, which is fine. I';m not saying you;;ll never like another anime. I';ve just seen a few people get discourage and I wanted them and anyone that might be considering to give it
a lot to see). It's got the best atmosphere (the atmosphere is so strong, it can be seen in the poster, and that is not the usual way Amicus films were presented), the story is very well written (the twisted ending I did predict, though, I was surprised to find out that I was wrong and there was an extra twisting of it), the cast is excellent, and even the sets are very well made. The only problem with this production was the fact it was made for a TV series, so the budget was very low, and it is visible in the way some of scenes were done. It's not a big problem, though, because Amici did their best to make this film the best they can, but it still was an average budget for a film of that time, so I can understand the limitations they had. Over all, this was a very good film, and I recommend anyone to go and watch this film and also the TV Series that it's based upon. It's worth it! *** (3 Stars - Good) Rated R for Violen...

Germany´s answer to these moviews, and their first full length movie is a paradox. A mix between "Das Leben ist Schön", "Das Leben is Schön und leicht zu leben" and "Billy Elliott", the movie tells us the tragic love story of the 24year old Michael (playd be the german star Matthieu Kaeu) and his 16year old boyfriend Paul (the young and talendeted new german actor Max Rüeger). But the main story of the movie isn´th the gay relationship of the two, the story is that of an unsuccessfule young man, that´th the story. But there´s another story. The one about a young man who falls desperatly in love with a 15 year old boy in a small town. The story about a young man with no future, who falls desperately in lov with a gay man who lovs him back. The movie tells us this sad tale, but also tells us the story of hope: Hope of a brigher, better future. The film tells us a lot about the gays, but also tells a lot about the german mentaility today. And it tells a lot more. It tells a sad story with the best of humor, and the best of love, it´st a movie, that tells a lot about the german society of
my early teens. It was one of the first books I read on my own when I was young and I still have a soft spot in this bookish old heart for the series. The cover above is the original one and I remember having this book and the next three (I think) when they came out and then I got them out again when I moved away to uni. I remember them very fondy. I'm pretty sure I had the complete set and I'm pretty certain I still have them. I'll have another look when I visit home next week. Anyway I'm going into this series completely blind but I've been informed by the lovlies over at Book Depository I'm in luck as they'll ship these books to the US. I can't wait to dive into these. They sound like the perfect summer reading and I'm going into it with zero expectatons and I'll tell all about it when its done. I think I'm in book heaven. I hope it last. I've got lots more books to come from this list! I just hope it's as funny, exciting as I remember it. If anyone's heard about these books, let me now in a comment below and tell all about it. I'm so excited for this. I can hardly wait. I have no doubt that I will adore them all over again and I hope you do to
about the film were the performances of Danny McBraye and John Hannity. I was also surprised at how much I enjoyed the story. The story of how the two boys came to be friends and how it affected the lives of the two boys in the end, really made the movie interesting. I also really liked the way it was filmed, I was impressed with all of the locations, and how the camera was used to show what each person't feelings were. I also really liked how they used the music in the film to show their thoughts. Overall, a very good film. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good movie. It is really good.

porn industry. I don’ t know what it is, I just do. But I have a good idea. There’ s no way this is going to work. But I’ m going to do my absolute best anyway. And I have no idea why. I’m not in love, and it’ s been years of therapy and patience that have brought us here, and this whole idea feels like a huge waste and miscalculation. But I’ m not backing out, and I’ m going in with the best of intent. I’ m going all the god damn way in. I’ m going in. I can only pray that the other person feels the same way. I can only hope that the other party is as invested in making our time spent together a success, as I know my partner will. We all have our own reasons as for why, and I’ m not going to ask. I won’ t need to. My only hope is to make sure my own reasons aren’ t the ones that are going to scuttled this thing before I even get started…and the only way to be confident that my own selfishness isn’t what’s killing this whole thing, before the fact is to put my heart and my mind in this whole thing. To be as open and as trustworthy as can possibly be. If that fails, and it probably won’t, I can always fall back on my
are so predictable. I’ve gotten to know the characters so well now that there’s hardly any surprisers. I mean, I know exactly what is coming up in future episodes. It would almost be funny if there were some twist, or surprise, but that’ll just be more of what I’v already seen coming up next season, so I just can’t get into a frenzy anymore. I know what’s coming, it would just be fun if they had something different. I know I sound like a total down-er. And I’M SO SORRRRE. lol. But I’m just being honest. It’s a great show. I’ve been watching all the seasons. I just need a break, is all, but I’ll probably still keep an eyeball on it. I’ll just wait till it gets bored. lols. I just hope it gets interesting and different again. I don’t want to lose this great show, I’m just not in the miiind to get into it, you knwo? lol. It’s a great show. But it could get better. Just saying. But I’m still hookd. I hope the show gets better and different. But it’ll prob be the same ol’ thing. But I’m still hookd on the whole thing. Just sayin’ l
All that was in it was the usual violence and sex. This movie was not good at any point, and Al was not even in the movie that often. I can'y really give this movie a high rating because there was absolutely no real acting or plot. This movie is a waste of your time. I would give you my opinion of how much this movie was worth, if it had anything good in it. I'll say this, it would'nt even be worth a quarter at the dollar theather. This is the worst Al Pacinos acting that I have ever see. This movie is horrible. I give it a D+, and I'll never watch this again, unless they have a movie marathon, which it's possible this may end. The movie' s title, "Gigli", means "dumb". That's exactly how I feel after watching that movie. I think that the title of this movie is a good representation of how horrible it was. This movie is a waste. I would give my opinion of it's value to a dollor theather, if it were any good. But, the only dollar theather this movie would'nt be in would be one with only one dollar movies. I give the rating of D+. The movie is not good at any point, except maybe the opening credites (which I'll discuss in the "Positve Feed back" area
Kingpin, but the movie was very boring. Quaids character is supposedly a genius, but his plans are always so stupid that it was impossible. It was also impossible to believe that a bunch of guys who are all in wheel-chairs can beat a professional baseball player who can run 95 miles an hours on the field. The best part of the film was when the fat guards were playing football. I would recommend watching the film, if you have a lot of time to waste. It would also be better to watch a better version of this film. I am giving this a C. It's not a classic, and it was just plain dull. There is a lot better films out there. I would rate this movie a little better if the ending wasn 't such as a joke. I think it was the best part. The ending is the reason I would give the movie 4 out 5 stars, not the whole movie. I recommend watching the original. That movie is a masterpiece. I think it is better than this rehash. I give this movie C-. It wasn''t that good at times when I watched this. I would give this a C- if it was just the ending of the film. I would recommend watching King of the Corpse Eaters. It is better. That is a master piece of the genre. It deserver a better rating. If you are a horror movie locker,
chocolate, hot chicks, hot guys, and even some romantic scenes! I can't think any more things this movie could have done to be better! I loved this! I recommend this movie for all ages, especially if you like fun, laugh, or are just a music-movie person like me! I loved this and it's one of the best movies of 1010! I loved this movie and I think you will to if you give it a try! You won't be disappointed in the least bit. I love this!! I recommend this movie to you all! I hope I can convence a few of ya to watch it! I'm going for a few more stars because it's really a great movie, and I love it! It's one of my favorites and you will love it too! This one of 1950! Enjpy! I love it!!!!!!! -Movieworld- (Review By: movietopia82) 06/19/2010 10:7:54pm pdt: This movie is one of my favorate. I have seen it many time. I love it because it is a musical, which is my favorite genre and it is a fun movie with a lot going on. I love the songs too. It was very fun to watch and the songs are very good
ruin the ending of the last movie, why did the writers of this one have such an easy time of making the movie. It is the end of the day, and she is a tired woman. I say, the ending of that last episode, the last movie was not ruined by the writer, it was ruined by the audience, the same audience that complainingly watch the movie. She is not amenable. I say: it is a different medium, and a movie is a different medium. She is unconcerned, and I know better than argue with her. She is tired after all. And, I am tired. The sun has been out for most if not almost all of that long, cold London day. We have been in London for a few days, and I have seen many things, some of which are quite beautiful, some that I find uncomfortabble, some that I find uncomfortably beautiful. She is tired, because she had to go to the dentist today and she is in pain. I tell here to put her head on my shoulders as I put my arm around hers, to rest it. It was the best decision I could'nt make, but I know now that I did. And, we walk through the night, through the cold London evening, to the hotel room. And, I am tired. But she, is sleepier then I, and I put her to rest. And,
so it is not a video. It is a movie, though a short, black&whie movie. The film is about a man in a white coat, who goes around in the night. He is a bit like a nightwatch. In this video he is chased through the streets. This video is from an old German movie from 1883. I have added a bit more to the sound track. The original film, the video and my sound track can all been found online in a very easy way. It is not hard at least for people with a bit more than a dial tone connection to download all the material, even if you don't want it for your video project. So it is a bit weird to call this a video nasty. It has a nastynes, though. It is a night of the Demon, though. The Demon was a bit like a nightmar. The man had to run away. And he did. He ran and ran and ran. He was running for the rest of his life, it was said, and that was a very short one. And he was running and running and he ran. But he did it so good that he never got tired. He kept going and running until the end. He did not even know what he did. He just did not stop. He was a nightwatch, though. A night watchman, who ran all night and night. He was a Demon

have. There are some fun moments, especially with the giant spoon that is used for eating everything, but it seems like they could'a made a funny movie out of the premise. Instead we get a movie that seems like it's trying to hard to make a point about not trying to hard to make the movie good. It seems that the filmmakers were too worried that they were going to be accused of making a kiddified film and they didn 'get' how to make a movie like this. There is a little fun in the movie, but it'a just not enough. It's a shame. It could'a been great fun. 1 out 4 stars. It is worth renting. It's not bad. But not great either...and it could' a be a little funnier. I'd say wait to buy this one. It is funny in a way that is not as fun as it seems. It's worth renting if you are looking for something to laugh about that is not as funny. 1 outs 2. It isn ' t bad, it's a fun movie. I'm giving this three because of the ending and I'm not a fan, but it's worth seeing. You can't go wrong with this one, especially for a movie like this one, I'd say. It is worth renting. It has good
on the Soviet block in the late 1970' and early 1 50's, if it would have helped me understand how it was for my mother growing up in a Russian Jewish family during the war years? I know my mother would never talk to us about those years and I know that there had been a great deal of shame associated w'h ith being Jewish that it was just too painfull to think about, and that is why we never knew anything about it. It is only now, when we are older and have a better perspective on the history of that period that we understand a little bit more about the pain that she went through. I am sure there is more pain to be had if we just looked deeper. I am not even talking about how my father was sent to a labour camp when my father and mother were just married. They were both very fortunate that the war ended when and where i't did because they both were saved by being in the right places at the right moment, and because they were not killed by the Nazis. I don't know what it is about me and my brother and mother that we are so different from our father, but I know that our mother is a survor. I know this because she has told it me many times. She has also said that her mother was a strong women and that she was the one who saved her life during that terrible time. I know this because I
These are the people whose names are forgotten but whose decedence will not. The names are: John H. Hollis, John Tunstall, John Poppleton, and William H Carver (Billy the Kid). John Henry Hollister was a former Texas law officer who moved to Dodge in 2004. His first job as deputies was in Lincoln County New mekico where John H. was killed by John Poeppleton in a fight. John Tunstalls was a former Texas law man as was Hollis. Tunsatl and Hollister had a fight that ended in a draw. John Tunstalls was a wealthy ranchman and was killed by John H Poeppletons in his store. William H Carvers alias, was known by many people but the one he was called was Billy the Kid. Carved had a fight in Dover and shot and killed John Henry Hollester. This was a big deal to everyone at this point because John H H was killed by a law officer. Carver killed H H because he was a deputize law officer. Carver then killed John P Poppletsons because Poppletson was the kids partner in crime. The kills were all in 1805 in New mexico. John Henry Hollist and John Tunstall was the first two to be killed, then John Henry Poepleton,
our system, which it should have but I think they went too much into the "evil corporatians". I don;;t think the system is evil, but I do believe we need to reform some parts, and they did it. The movie is great for what it is. A documentry that shows the other point. It's not a balanced point of the view, it has an aganda, and I think it does a good job of making people think. I think we should change the system to a system like this. It's not perfect by any way, but the movie shows the other side of things. It's a great film. It makes you think and question things. It'll open your mind. It will make u see things. And that is the goal. I give it a 10/10. A must watch for anyone. I would say it should be manditory watching for everyone in the Usa. I give it 5/6 stars and that'll be a must watch. It'll change your mind on things. It is a good film, and I hope everyone goes to see and think about what the movie has said and how we can change. I hope people will change their mind on this and not be so quick to say "oh they are communisims" because they're a good country and a good system to have in place. If you have any questions or need help
you know that story? Well this is it. It's a story that's as old as the oldest of old stories. It has been retread over, and over, by countless artists and story cravers. It's not a story of triumph, and it certainly isn’t a tale of courage, and yet it’d one that I find myself returning to over- and over. It’s a story of a hero who doesn't want to be one but has no real option in the mater and it' s a story of a King and how the hero is treated. It has been the subject matter for numerous books (both fiction and not); countless movi e s (both good and bad). It has inspired the lik e of JRRT, JKR and many others. It'a a story of the hero and the monstr. It' s a story that, in my mind, has a few lessons for us to be learnt. So, without further delay, let's take this story and break it into it’’' parts. The Story: The hero, a simple black mage, had a small house and was living in a small town on a world called Earth. He was a quiet, unassuming fellow who had no desire to fight or slay monsters but had no desire to live in a world where the monsters could do as they wished. The world was a strange and
but the story was just all sorts of crappily ploddy, with a very slow moving plot, which didn’t even have anything to make it feel as if anything was at all happening. In fact, it seemed as if nothing much was ever gong to happen, so I was surprised when it all came good in a rather sudden and abrasively violent way. I suppose it is supposed to have the same effect on the main protagonist (Jeff Bridges) of it coming out of the blue that it did with those on screen, who were all left with the shocked look of a deaf man being asked to guess what noise a bell has just made, but it left me feeling the same and a bit cheated. It’s a very odd film that is very different from Altman''s other work and it was a bit of an experience to see. I was left feeling a bit like I had been hit in the head with a large piece a of wood. The film is set in the mid-1970''a in LA, where a bunch of people, all with their heads screwed firm into their back, get up every morning to try to find the meaning and point to their lives, while at night they all go and watch the latest horror flick or a western in a cinema, which is run in a very weird way, with the film being changed every half of the evening, while the projection
I went with my father who had been a soldier during WW1 and had seen many things he never talked about to us, but I remember him being deeply moved and sad by the movie. I remember the movie was very dark and sad, it had a strong impression upon me. It was a very good movie. I think it was the very first movie I ever saw, and I have been going often the movie theater ever after. I remember the name was “Le Sang Des Autres”. The story was a very powerful one. I remember it was a story about a German soldier who, after the end, went on with the other Germen soldier to a town, where the Germans were still occupying a part, I think in the North of Italy or France, but I don'T recollect the name of the town or the name of this part of the town. They were waiting for orders from Berlin to come back to the Father land or stay there, but they never got those orders...I remember that at one moment one Germans soldier was looking at his girl-friend in a bar who had been captured in France or Italy by some French soldiers...I think she was French. She had become German soldier's girl-friend during their stay there. The Germen girl- friend, who loved her boy-friend very very much was so sad when seeing her, he had been captured...He was cryng...and I remember that he said to the
middle school. This movie was the first Disney film I saw in the theater and I remember it being very fun. The music is very catchy, the characters were fun, the plot was good, and the animation was very nice. My parents had a copy on VCR when this movie came on TV. I still have the movie somewhere at my house. I have been looking to buy an old version on Amazon, eBaY or at a thrift shop. I hope to see this on DVD. I will probably be the only one that buys it. This movie was a big hit when this first was released. It should be a big classic now. I hope I find a good copy of this movie in the future to add to my movie collection. I give it A. 9/10. I will be watching a replay of this movie on the Disney Jr TV show, "The Wonder Years" on Saturday, May 19th 25th. It is a Disney Junior TV show that features Disney films on Disney Junior TV, Disney's Channel, Disney Channel, Disney Channel UK/Canada/Indo, Disney Channels worldwide, Disney Channel Latin-America, ABC-Family, ABC-Family International, and ABC. I hope you like this movie! Thanks for reading and have fun. -Dylanthewolf2012. 10:7:17PM 8/21/
rather then enjoy watching Hannibal Lerter eat a man's face. It'll be a long while before I see that.... but I will get around to watching it, I'm sure! But, I do agree with what most people have said, I can' see any way that the movie could have had such a profound effect upon me if it hadn't. So, it'a a very unique movie in the aspect that most people are affected in a profund way... but I just don't know if it could have been that way if it wasn't based on the novel, or if it had just been some other random storyline, it's just hard for to imagine! It is a very interesting movie though, and it is one that I think everyone should see at least once in their lifetime! I just think that it is so unique that it would not have been the same if it was just made into a regular novel. It'd still been good though, but not as powerful as it is! So, it is an amazing movie... but I think it's a very unique one, and I'd be hard-pressed to think of many other moviies that have affected people so profound! But it is very good in any case! And, I do plan on buckling-down somtime soon to finish the entire book, it is a very interesting one. I just hope I can

costumers, and cinematographers. It is obvious that there was great care and attention to every aspect that contributed to a unique look. I was not impartial to the story line, however I was not boring either, but I was not overtly moved by it either. I was drawn into a different time and a different world that was familiar yet foreign and I was able to appreciate the film in that regard. I would recommend this film to a friend because I think it was a very interesting piece that would appeal to many. I would like to watch it again in a couple of months and then write a better evaluation. I think it will grow on my and I hope that I can find something more interesting to write next time. I do not think that I will be writing about this film again. Thanks for the chance. I really enjoyed it and will recommend it. Thank you. Thanks for your time and attention and for taking a look. Thankyou. Thanks for the opportunity to see this film. I was very happy with my decision to watch and I think that it was a great experience for me.

be shown in the UK. I have to confes that, in my ignorance, it was only when reading the Wikipedia article on this film and the one for its star, the great French comedian Jacques Feyder that, I discovered that he is also a director. It is not the only time I have made this discovery and it has made my enjoyement of many films that much more enjoyale knowing that, in this case, I have watched a great comic performance from a great comic genius. I have seen several French comedies from this early period of sound films and, though they are all very enjoyable (and often in French) the one that I always remember is this one, which I saw in my early twentaies. This is because it has a very English feel, in a way that reminedes of the E. A. Dupont's "Under the rods" from the 30's. It also reminds me of the English comedy that I saw when a boy of the 7o's, "Caravan", and of "The Pink Panter". It is a very English comedy in many other ways, not least with the wonderful, eccentric, English butler played superlativly by the great, great, great character comedian Charles Vanel. The film has an excellent, if not particularly original plot, but it is the characters that make it, and the way
pretty well. There are some very amateurish elements to it but they are few and far in between so the overall effect is quite professional and enjoyable. The film is very well acted, the sets and costuming are all very good considering the small budget, but it is the special FX that make this film really stand out from the herde. The special EFx are done by one single man in his basement. They are so well designed that you would never guess this was a very small budget movie. There are a few scenes that are so good it's hard believe one man could do this alone. The story and script is also really good. The only negative things about the movie are the few scenes with dialogue where the actors seem to be reading from a script. I'm not sure how much this had anything to to with a limited cast and crew but it does seem to be a little staged. The film is not perfect by anyone means, it has it' short comings, and the dialogue is a big one, the overall effect of the movie is very pleasing and very well worth watching. The film also contains some really nice music and some great sound design. The movie also has it' self made opening credits with a very cool song. Overall this is an extremely enjoyable movie to view that you would never know was a small film if you did't already. The only downside is that it has been out of print
fun since the first season of the Sopranos came on. I was a fan of the Swedish version which was a little more dramatically taut than the new American version. That said I think the new version is a great ride. It's like Die Hard but with more twist. And more twisty. If you liked DieHard I'm guessing you'll love ReDeaye. I can say that it is a much better film than the recent DieHard sequel which is a good film, mind, just not as fun as the originals. The film is a great pop corn flick and the kinda movie that will keep you on the hook and guessing. The film is very well paced. I won't go on too far about the film as it'll take you too many twists and surprises that I don' think it's worth spoilering for you but I will tell you this much. You won.t be bored by it. It's a real page- turn- turn- turner that will have you sitting on your seat. I'm going to see this movie more times than I have the Diehard sequels, and I have already seen them once. And the best of the bunch of them. I can' tell you how many times this movie is worth seeing. Maybe you could go to see it twice and still have more to come back and see. And that
zany cameoc appearances and the obscurity that they are. It'll also make your head hurt if, like most Beatles fan, your brain isn'r fully developed yet, but then again, that't what this kinda thing's for... to mess with your head, and to show the Beatles' humor in the midstst of their fame. It may be a little hard for those who don't know the Beatles, and those with no sense, but it's a movie that's fun to watch. It may be a movie of the sixty'st, but it'll always make you feel like a kid. So if you'v got time on you hands, and a brain that works, this movie is one worth seeing. Otherwise? You'll have to watch it for the zanyness, and the cameo's. This one'd worth watching for those reasons. Otherwise, it'l be hard. And it's not that fun of a movie, but you'll always have those zany cameo appearances to think and laugh at. And, of coarse, the obscurity of the Beatless, too, so that'll make it a bit funner than it would be otherwise, but still not that much. But it'll give you a few laughs. So, if you wan't a good laugh, then watch it if you know a lot about
in the world (she's not even the best looking actress in the show)....and the whole premis is so ridiculous. I mean a girl who kicked ass with magic powers, and now she has no powers, but is still a badass? I don' t get it at al, and I can't take her seriously. She's just too pretty and too dumb looking. And her dating the Angel, who I think is pretty hot, and who' s been through more angst and tragedies in his 5-year run than I've seen in my whole life. I just don't think this is right. But I guess the fans like it. And if that is the case, then I guess it works, and the writers can go to hell, cause they've just ruining everything. I think it'd have more of the same if they just let her keep the magic powers. But then again, maybe the writers are geniuses and this is the only way for it to work...but it seems to me that they're taking a great show that has the potential for great drama and turning it all to hell. I'm not sure. Maybe I' m being to harsh and not giving the show the chance it deserve...I d' know. But that is how I see things so far....maybe I 'll change my opinion later on. For now though, I
be this great. The story is interesting and very engaging as the movie progress. The acting in this movie is great. The characters are well developed. I think this film deserving more attention. If this film is not nominated for Best Movie, then it' a huge shame. I think this deserves a lot of attention and recognition, and it is certainly worth watching. If this is your first movie you see of this genre, I would recommend that you watch this movie. The acting in this movie is so good, I was really amazing. I hope that this movies will be more popular, I think that it deserves much better than this movie. I give it a 7 out a 1. I hope that this movie will win a lot awards and get the attention it deserve. I hope that this film will be nominated and won some major award, like the Oscar or Golden Glob. If it does not, than I think that it deserv it more than this film. The only thing I can say about this, it was really good, I hope you watch it. If you want more movies like this then go watch this. I really hope that you watch this and enjoy the great movie. 7.2/9.8 for sure. I give it 10 stars. I hope that this film wins a Oscar for Best Movie. If it not then I will be a sad penguins, I will give it a rating

was so predictable, so obvious. If I want to see the story of Mosess, Jesus and the Holy Lands again I'll just read the books or watch the original movies. This movie is nothing more than an action pack with some good special effect. It's not a bad action pack, it'll give a good hour of fun in a movie theatre. But that'a it. If you want a good story with a little action then this movie is not worth seeing. But if like the story of Mosess, Jesus and The Holy Lands, then this is the movie for you. I'm just saying, don't expect anything from the story. You've got a good hour and a half to watch some nice effects. But that wonen you'll forget after you leave your seat in the dark theatre. I'll say it once more, I don'tt think that this is a good film for people who wants good action. But if it's just the effects you look for, then this is the movie for. You've just to sit back in your seat and let the story unfold. I's a very good movie for children and people who wants some action. I'm not that type of a person that like the action packs with the story of Jesus and the Holy lands. But this movie is for you, not for me, and the people who donw want to watch a good
Wish you had stayed with it. This is a completely new story with no relation at all with film Noir. The story is not as good as the original. The acting, while good, is not great. There is nothing wrong with it, but it does not compare. There is no tension, no sense of danger, and no real mystery to solve. The story has been watered-down and it is no longer the story of a murder. The story is not the story of one man' life but the story of many people' s. The ending is a disappointment and it makes the story of the murder not so important, and the film does a good enough job with that, it is just a shame that the filmmakers had to ruin it. This was a film that I wanted to see, but I was too distracted to watch. It was not as good I had hoped, but still very enjoy-able. I would recommend this to any film fan. 7 out of ten. I would like more mov-ie-s like this in the coming days and in future. Thank You. I have been a film fan and movie fan for over thirty years. It has never stopped me enjoying the films, but it does make me wonder if this is the only way to enjoy it? I will be looking out in future for more films like this. Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy this review. I am
my opinion with the sole purpose of making a movie that will get people to pay more at the box office. This is the one problem that plagued the first film, this is the same for The Imaginaries, and even with The Barnyards, where the first two films where a huge hit at the Québec box offices (The first film grossed more than $200, million and the sequal grossed more than $160 million). The problem is that, like I'm sure you've guessed, this is just a money-maker for Quebec'ing biggest film company and not an artistic piece. The plot is simple: The Barnabies, who've been separated after the events from the first movie, are trying (once they're re-united, obviously), to find out why their parents have disappeared. And, well the story is pretty simple: It's the storyline that'll make you watch the moviethough, and that'll keep it entertainment for the rest of it. I mean, the story is very simple and it does have a few plot-ho... (More.) - See 112533256799579327953895435428453495453494528454253845284
guards in the courtroom was amazingly funny, and the movie was a lot more lightheartd than I remember it being, especially in the beginning. Still, this movie holds a very special spot on this list! I love this movie! 9/1/13 1:01PM PT: I was thinking about it. I think that this movie was better than Good Fellers and Casablanica. This was the best. Goodfellas was better. 2/18/15 5.30PM Pt. It's funny how people are talking about how Good Fellows and Casinova are better moves. I think that The Firm is better than them both because it is the best movie ever to come out in this era, I love this film. This movie was the best. 2/18/15, 7.45AM Pt. The Firm was better, I think. The Fellows is better. 1/16 1.45 PM: The Fellows is better than Casaba, Casaba and even Casaba, but this movie is the best ever and I think this one was better than Casaba. 1/4: I love the Firm, but I like Casaba more and I think this one's the better one. I think The Firm will be the better one. 
(1991) is a very good example of a B Movie. "The Last Stand", the sequel to "The Last Detail" (1890-11-08) was not a sequel to the original "Last Detectable" film. It was more an action adventure film. The sequel is set about twenty or so minutes before the original "Lethal Detective". The film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Detectives Jesse Ballard and his sidekicker, Detective Sergey Sasha. Det Seargey Ballard is a tacit police officer and Detective Ballards's partner and Det Searjee'Sarah is a very young police officer. Ballart is also an alcoholic and has had many encounters and arrests of the criminal element. In the beginning of The Last Detective, Ballard is in a car with a friend and he is in a car with a girl. His friend is killed and he has to get the girl out. In the beginning, Ballard gets the car and drives away from the car. He has to stop because a car comes up and he is in a hurry to catch it so Ballard gets out of the car and drives the car away. Ballart gets the car and drives away and Ballart stops and gets out of the car. His wife and the woman in his wife
, and finds himself clashes and connect with the boys and the boy' s parents, who are a little concerned when Robert is so much more involved. The boys, however are very excited. Robert finds himself getting involved in the lives of these young boys and the boy' s parents. This is a funny and warm story of what can happen with a group that you least suspect. I really found myself getting caught up into this story. I was so sad that this was over and that I had to say Good Bye to the boys and parents.

this period. I also thought that the lighting was good and that the sets were good. I thought it would have been nice if the set could change for different locations, but I understand that it might have caused problems with set changes. It did make a good use out if light and darkness to represent different locations and times. In my opinion, the light was also used well. I thought the light was used well, but I also thought that there could have maybe have been too little. At some points, it would have made the performance feel less inteny. I did enjoy watching the play because it is a very good adaptation and the characters are all believable. It would make an excellent GCSE text. It is very relevant and is very well written. I also thought that the play made excellent use of the stage space. There was a clear sense of time and place in the production. I also thought it was very fun and entertainning and that it was very funny. I also think it would make an excellent text to study at GCSEE. The production was also a little confusing, but I think that this may have made the audience feel a little more empathetic towards the character because it was a little more realistic. I also thought the production was good, but it could be improved. I thought this because the performance was a little too long and it was hard to concentre. It was also hard to concentre because of the long scenes. It was

I'm sure I speak not just the words for the other 165 people who gave this film a rating. This movie was wonderful!!!! Thank you, everyone!!!!! I love it!!! I love Alison and I love her voice!!! What more could you ask for!!! Thank You!!! I loved this film!!! I love this movie!!!! I can hardly stop smilling!!!! I'm so happy I watched it!!! Alison I love you!!! Your voice was just so beautiful!!! Thank you!!! You're so beautiful! I love you! This movie was just amazin!!! I hope to be a singer just like your voice is!! You're so beautiful, Alison! I love you!!!! You've got a beautiful voice!!! I love you!!!! You've got a beautiful voice and you'r so beautiful! I loved this movie and I hope that they'll make another. I can just hardly believe that it has a viewer ratings rating of only a little under 5.4!!! I
Rhimes though. I also like the fact that the film was shot on the east end. I was surprised to hear they filmed in my neighborhood. I will not go see it again. I will also not be buying the film either. I did enjoy hearing some of my favorite hip/hope music though. I did not expect to see the film, but I had to see what the buhzz was about. I was disappoint. I will not go see the movie ever. Not even to rent it. It is that disappointful. It's a shame. The film is suppose too take place right down the road on Long Beach Ave. I did notice it was not. It is suppose too take place around the 50's or 690s. I did notice that too, it is not the 980s, and I do know Long Bech is not that far from there, so I do understand how they could not have filmed the actual place, but if it did, the film would look like it was filmiing on location. I did see some of the film was filmi in NYC. It does not matter though because I did not like it. If the film was about a real person then it might of worked. The character played by Ving was the only likabl character. I did like how he was able to make money off of a real story, but it was not worth it
don't buy it; just watch it for FREEEEEE. This is the first in the series of "Beach FLICK" moviemaking. I'm not sure if there will be a sequal. However, I am certain that if this was a real beach it would not look anything at all as it does in this movie, so don’ t waste your time looking at the ocean. I am certain you are not going on vaca. So, why not sit down, relax and enjoy this movie, which is a little bit more entertainment than watching a rock fall from the sky into someone’s head, and then watching the person who has just had rock crammed into the side of their brain, die a painless death, which last 20 seconds, and then the person who is the recipient of the rock in the head is a hero. So, why not sit in the comfort of your livingroom or wherever you happen to have the TV, and watch this flik. The story line, as they say, is that a group of friends are on vacation in Hawaii. There is no real conflict. In the end everyone is happy with themselves. This flick, as I have just mentioned, was made for nothing. The acting, the music and the cinematography are horrid. This is a movie for those of you who are looking to kill a half-day, not the kind you will want watching

us go to the local theaters and see some B grade horror/scifi films and I always have the same thought......... "Wow! I have never heard of ANTHING like this before"!!! And this one is just the best of the bunch!!!! A bunch of people get off a bus in front of a mall. They are looking for a place that slices and cooks meat. Well, they end in a butchers shop. The butchs wife gets a bit freaked by them and goes to get his gun, which is hidden in the meat coolers. She gets the wrong cooler open though and finds the body of some guardsman in some of her husband"s meat. So she kllls the guyz and her hubbie comes in. They are both arrested and thrown in to jail. The womans brother, who is also the butch, is looking to get her out and he gets a hold of the gun and kills her husband, who is now a cop. Now they are after his sister and her husband and they are after her too, so they kill him and she is now a fugative from law enforcement and on the way out to the country to hide. She gets a ride from a couple of guys who are driving out in a van full with the meat she has been selling at the local mall. She gets in, she kills them and she gets the van and
who has been a great highschool basketball player himself and wants to make a star of one young man. He is willing to go to any lengths. It' s not a good role model though. It has a lot of action, and the scenes where the young man is in danger are tense. The acting is excellent. The movie is about 10 years too late to be called realistic though. The ending seems a bit abrupt, and not a bit realistic, though it was a bit too long and drawn out. The basketball scenes are exciting though, and there are a couple of great scenes where Dennis Quaid is playing the basketball. It shows the passion that a basketball game brings with it, but it seems more than a little forced and unbelieving. It' s hard to take seriously a game like that, even if it is played by Dennis. Still, it'ss a good movie, but I think it would work better as one of those sports films that you watch for fun, instead of as a serious film. I think it could work better if it was about a basketball player who wanted to win the big championship, instead, and that would work better. I've seen the film, though I haven'ts read it, and it'ss not a bad film. It just feels like they should have gone for a real life movie instead, like a real life sports drama. This movie has a lot going in it, though

. This film is not only about the heroism of these soldiers but their humanity in the face of death. The soldiers are portrayed as real people who are not afraid of the enemy but of their own fear. They are not afraid because they know that the war is not going to win, but it is a test for their brains. The movie is not about heroes or villainy, and it is not about a war, it’ s not about the soldiers, and it not about the enemy and the hero. It’ s about the human side and the reality of the war, about how the war is not over, but it is still going on, and how we should be prepared for what is to become of us. This is a movie that shows us the human side of our soldiers in the war, how we are not always heroes, and how the heroes are not always the best. This is a movie that shows us that we are the real enemy. It also is about how our soldiers are fighting for the freedom of their country and for their fellow coun.

we must prescribe as ineffectual directives and a total absence of dramatic tensions and tonalities. The resultant picture is not so much bad, as it has to make do with the term, 'inert'. This is a case of a director who has a lot to teach his actors, and a writer who is not up the standard of his material. I am sorry to be harping upon such a theme as the director, Mr Hare, but his performance in the film is the single worst performance by a director in the history, of film. He is a disgraces. The film has no pace, no sense. The actors are left stranding, the director is clueless, and there are no characters. It all comes down to Mr.Hare who should not even have been allowed to direct this picture. The actors have done well in this film, but their efforts are not good, and the director has done them an iniquity by allowing them this ineptitude. I can't recommend it. It's not good enough for that... 2014... 89 min... 7.1 rating on IM... 4/2015. The film, I believe will be forgotten within a year of it'd release date. And it deserves to be forgotten. 2/10.

the book, and left a bad taste in the mouths (pardon the expression, but it was necessary to make my case). The film had a decent cast. Tim Curry, Diane Lansing as the doctor who has her own reasons for coming into a dangerous area, Ian Holme, James Brolan, and a few others. The film had some great scenes, but for the most, was a bore. The film was not as good in the special effects as Jurastick Park, nor did it hold the suspence and intrigue of The Andros Incendent or Sphere, but it did have it's own appeal, as it did with it audience, and it was not a box office bomb. The film was good, not excellent and not terrible either; the film could have used more development of the main character, and it could also use a few cut scenes. I give the film an eight. I think Cricketton has a knack at writing books that have potential to be movied, and he has the potential and resources for movielike films, but the execution leaves something lacking in quality. I hope he can get a gripp on his writing style, and I do not know how much time he has left to do so. The book is a must read.

Homemaker'll be missed, but at the least, I know there've always been other shows with good writing on the air, like The X-File. Homemaker was definitely a cut ahead and the writing was top-rate.

surprise it seems I've seen this movie before, but that's because it'd so boring. The first half of this is pretty banal, but the second part is pretty good, but not worth watching. The plot is just so uninventiv, that it gets boring after a few minutes. The characters are all boring and not very well written either. They've been given some pretty good actors to play them but that isn’t really enough. I was a bit annoying to hear all the American people speak English, because it was really bad English. The only good part of this movie is the last half, but that doesn’t make it good enough. If you like action movies, then you probably won’t like this one. If you’ve seen the last Die- Hard film then there is nothing left to do but wait for a sequal. But I doubt that will happen, this one was so bad. So, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you don’t know if this is good or banal. This movie was a bit better than the second Die- Hair film but it wasn't great. I give it 6 outta ten. This is the first movie I'm going to see with Dwayne 'The Rock"' Johnson, and it'd so boring that the film isn’t worth seeing. The acting is just awful, the plot was so

something that would have appeared on a B-list cable network in the 950s, if that network hadn' t gone off the air years and years ago, leaving this film to rot in obscure and shame. The acting and the plot, if you want t call it that are so terrible, that this is one movie that should be left in your memoes and never watched again! This film is so awful in every aspect possible that I have to wonder if the people that made and acted in it actually have anything to do with the filmmaking industry, because if you can' t make a film that' s watchble, why should you ever try to? There is no reason for this film, and there is no good reason for this site. I would have given this film a rating below one, but this site only goes to zero! Please, for the love all that' s holy, do NOT waste a second of you life watching this movie. If the people that wrote this movie had any dignety, they would never want it seen again, so why are you wasing your time looking for it? If you can stumple across it, run! Run far, far away! This movie is terrible, so terrible that I'm almost sure that even the people who wrote it don' t want you to see it and that' s a sure sign you should never see a movie. This movie is so bad that it should be buried forever
sexually harass a girl in the elevator and then when she screams, he tells her she has a big mouth and she should shut it, and he is the victim! Or the guy in a wheelchair who has no idea that his wheelchair has a motor in the back because it is so small, which makes his wheeler go forward. And then he goes to college. You get the idea. You have to be careful about making jabs like that because people will say, “Huh, what’d I miss?” You have to know what you’ll be talking to. You don'T know that. It is easy for people to make funny jabs at people with disabilities. You know the kind of jab I want is when the person has the disability and is able. You have to be able to talk with the people who are affected by it, not the able. I’M NOT ABLED. You have a disAbILitIES. The people I am with are abled. The people I meet have the abIlitities. They are not disabled. They are able. They are just different from you and I, that’s all. I think it’'s funny when people say they are able and then I ask them what they are disabled with. I don'T get it! I don’t think it is a good idea for people to be abled when they

it felt like a poor man’ s version of “Draco Malfoir and the Deathly Hallos”. But that’ s not to say it was boring. It was very entertaining and the fight scenes were excellent, and that’ s what I liked about it! But if I hadn t been so excited to finally meet “Harriet the spy ” and “Matryoshca dolls” I think it w ound’ t have been that enjoy able! I think they should have stuck to one storyline instead! But all in all I’ m giving it 3 stars because it was fun and exciting, if not a bit clutter ed and confusing in some places, and the fight scenes were really cool! I think if you’ re a Harry P owter fan you’ ll love it. It really is a lot of the same, but it’ s a lot different and you get to see more of “Harriot” which i think will make the movie. I give “the Deathly Hallow s” a 4 stars out of 3, because it was just a really fun, exciti ng movie! I’ m looking foward to seeing it a second time! I don’t know if i would say I would be disappointed in the film if i hadn’t been so looking forward t o it. I would say I would have been a little dissapppoint ed, I mean it
triliogy. This one is about a Romanian girl who is in search of her long-lost father. She meets the love of his life, a gypsie. She also meets the man who killed her father. And finally the man who saved her. It takes a long journey through a Europe of different cultures, to reach the final destination: love. The film was shot in Romania, Germany, Greece, Turkey, France and Spain. The story is inspired from a real event. The director'a grand-mater was the only surviving passenger in Titanik's last voyage. He was the only gypsy on board the ship, but the story of a love triangle is not new in Romanians' history. This film won the Golden Palm at 2010 Cannnes, the most prestiogous film festival. The music was composed by the legendry Italian composer, Luis Brunetto, and the cinematography is out-of-this world! This is a must-watch! (IMDB) (137m.)(1999)(101m.) (126m., France, Germany) Subtitles: English (1.05m., 1.55m.,) and French (2.55). Directed by Gatlife. Starring Omar Metwalley, Mariana Ignateanu, and Jeanne Balanca
