such. Marriage proposals, romantic scenes, strong drinks and bourgeoisie dilemmas, what more do you want from a chick flick? Amidst all the cheese and teardrops in the theater, there seemed to be an underlying message that we, the audience, were being encouraged to pick up on. I think the message was along the lines of “go out there and seek what you truly love, because if you don’t you’ll end up being miserable”, and whilst I could agree with this, I don’t think that the problem is our pursuit of happiness through the criteria provided to us by movies. In fact, I think that the problem is that, in the presence of these criteria, we have to justify why we do not seek them, since happiness has become quantifiable through a formula set on a pedestal for us to reach. An example of this would be a woman opting out of marriage and simply being a housewife. In most movies, the woman does not deserve a decent life or a man, and she whether she liked it or not, is made to look foolish either for being a housewife or being confident enough to have carved her own career path. In regards to the Eva Green character, she is portrayed as an independent spirit, with a sense of adventure, so if she were…a bad girl, you know what I mean? By now you should, and if both mother and daughter, had
a limited budget makes the accomplishment so much greater. Director/co-writer VARUN TENEJI clearly understands how to frame images and thereby set the tone of the story Since it must have been a financial challenge to film each pane of glass, there is a deep sense of awe and mystique that permeates the experience of watching the film. When protagonist DJ's (NIKHIL) mother decides to return to her hometown to visit her dying hospitalized father (K NAYARAJ) the pair ride a train from Bombay that is undergoing repair which gives the pair the chance to wander off the train to visit a neighboring town. While there they investigate a large glass factory that harks back to the days when the region was ruled by British aristocracy. Wandering through the ghostly ruins we also begin to have an idea of the society & class differences that underpin the struggles of the community. During their wanderings they listen to DJ's discarded iPod and obey an instruction to walk toward a certain point of the town when it starts telling them to "walk toward the green light." Before setting off they visit a British Museum-like building where the people building this new spiritual world ask that they sign a document agreeing to protect the secrets of their society. Even as they wander through the room they are subtly pushed closer and closer towards the out of place music of
the Breakdown deals with the story of a kidnapping.  Here's how it begins : Stolen from her front yard in broad daylight, the six-year-old daughter of a Washington, DC, family is found murdered in nearby Rock Creek Park. An extensive manhunt ensues for the kidnapper, pitting the brave police detective who carried her, Stephen Vaughn, and his boss, Sanford Cabot, against a clever criminal who may be feigning mental retardation. In this spine-tingling psychological thriller, Patricia Cornwell goes intoFIELD.Com--place of overly wealthy foundations, law schools, and television crews--to bring us VICKI's VICTIM, the crushed life, the shame and anger of a man who's been deeply hurt, the shock of his discovery of Vicki's likeminded spirit...All while her father, the good Hugo Logas, lives it up in newly postcommunist Europe. Cornwell is skilled and elegant as ever in this searing episode in the story of constant investigator Andy Brazil. Mystery Writers of America honored VICKI'S VICTIM with the coveted Edgar Award for best novel, and this modern director's cut will entrance the multitudes of others who love her work. -- LuAnne Roznos. p. cm.

Italy during harvest season, the film follows a very longithonic string of plot twists as the anally retentive protagonist becomes slowly less uptight about murder after murder. A prop clown is the prime suspect and other filmmakers picked up on the original fondness for scary clowns like this in the late 90's/early 00's (The Killer Clown, It, Clown House...) so it is with great pride that I must update the trendometer by listing the clown classic in with the new class. The story is based on a true Italian getaway where 6 years previously 5 students and a professor got lost on their way to a local university and then lashed out at the very nice but racially condescending Saltamarti family. 4 students were murdered during this travesty, the professor was missing at the time of the incident. And the rest, as they say, is history. In Fulci's piece, most members of the Lugini family take a back seat to plot fatigue, but the scenery is so great...the film should be treated more as "shipwreck porn".Wikipedia says this film was nominated for various awards, I am having trouble figuring out which awards and did find this picture with Miss Isabelle on David Bowie's head, wearing headphones and also sucking on peyote so I'

Britain consumes more calories per head than any other country and is now the most obese nation in Western Europe. After the Second World War Britain was the leanest nation in Europe. Its people enjoyed a low-fat, high-fibre Mediterranean-type diet. "This completely changed," says Professor Tordoff. "There was the drift towards convenience food, and something called the promotional drenching. The same food could be promoted in a completely different way with the phrase 'cholesterol free' or 'full fat'." It started off with rashes, eczema, migraines, and itchiness. My kids were 9 and 11 at the time and I thought it was in my imagination since they'd never had any major health problems except the usual flus and colds.
movies and direct-to-DVD horror flicks can only manage to occasionally show a spark of life, there are still those productions that go that extra mile. Maybe their intentions are not so ill-placed. Horror filmmakers must inherently be a bit left of normalcy to even get into the business. The Santorini, Shit Can (I refuse to call it "Jesus Christ, Vampire Slayer," by the way) and April Rain are some such films. Goodness knows that folks are not going to make a full-blown feature film about an effeminate, lunatic vampire hell bent on seeking out virgin prey and slaying them while wearing vibrant red clothing. In fact, a full-blown feature is a bit an awfully tall order for such a downright silly subject. Elsewhere, there is a true passion for this craft and while movies such as April Rain or ever so recent publication Highthorpe Abbey are a bit too embarrassing to even bother reviewing, the slightly simpler and more easily consumable The Queen of Blood is a decent throw-back to a by-gone era. Unrealistic, schlock and archaic it may be, but therein lies its charm. If you can get over the crudeness of the plot (which is easy when you consider its brevity) and the overly-theatrical performances (
tonight, as the British Film Institute has confirmed that all British cinemas are closed, for the foreseeable.  Both the independent venues in Stamford such as The Atkinson and Sunningdale as well as the multiplexes that have usurped such charming antiquities as the small family run cinema – Cine de Luxe in Bourne, Westgate Fiesta in Spalding to name but a couple.  Anyone watching a programme on radio 4’s Today show this morning would be forgiven for thinking that a rock star has died – the nation’s first preference for paying homage being believed and championed in cuttingedge environmentally friendly, and smartly priced new builds, (not hunched in hobnailed anoraks clutching a bust of Julie Christie sequestered inside a multiplex in West London.)  In five minutes, no less. At least twenty different celebrities wafted their breaktakingly perceptive comment on the closures of the nation’s cinemas, to the ever more desperate sounding Radio 4 newsreader.  She topic hopped more than the headlines on Page Three, from theatres, to opera and so on, all requiring subsidies in the light of the pandemic, leaving shedloads of theatres etc wailing in personal testimony.  No sign of any, er, us.  I suppose we’re
one people don’t like. Put down stuff, hate it. But here is a sequel I don’t see a lot of love for, and it’s following a Good movie. To be honest, this one holds up pretty well in this day and age, but maybe not for the right reasons. As a times capsule, this does a beautiful job of capturing the 80s, no disrespect or anything real bad…I just don’t think it holds up as a horror classic. Bad dialogue and Enfield…inhuman roar. And Kyle Maclachlan…eh, but I do love those scenes in bed. He will lose the virginity again and again on film…that’s one perk of a long acting career. 2.0 for being a sequel no one really demanded. Enjoy, haha. And shout out to Matt. Or Aiden. Or something. I don’t get you. Ahem. Below Dolan Ray’s review. He’s the one that broke it down for you. Enjoy. Review from;/ after movie. A 2.0 a random number when it was working. Also, this movie is from 1987. Enjoy! Hm, sounds like Rob isn’t someone you fuck around with. Nothing like fourteen to wake you up. A wise decision like it would have been a mistake to leave. That’s how you rescue,
that created Nip/Tuck..." Its not so much story driven, it banked a lot on the back story delivered through Beta projection on films, but does deliver on having the same crossroads dialogue soap pyramid-styled "episodes", as if a short film serial that created its own own popular buzz. Its about very progressive ideas; partnership conjugation (my term. Where there is a permanent partnership between a couple - and all resulting children are considered as if they where born to two women. A kind of legal gender equality arrangement - the legal gender constraints and perception, that we'd all had beaten into us from societal and now humanly engineered hormonal perspectives, are taken out of the equation on a cyberworld system. Anyway, i dunno how i missed two episodes... Perhaps, due to somewhat blase press guff, and because this is quite weird - even more confusing. A pretty novel idea. Had the darker, edgier style touch of her other projects. Has sort of a Nick Reagan FX look to it. Keanu plays one of the two "women". GONZ, UDEM! Have Fun!d its a snack, but not really a fill your pants kind of game. Looks like they are introducing even more deeper subject matters into the storyline developement in series # 2.

been seeking entertainment value in the movies of Donald O'Connor and Nancy Olson for two-and-a-half hours. It is one of the few of Plitt's offerings this season that takes place in the middle of this decade and not the 40's. Furthermore, it depicts life in Italy (the locations were taken in Turin and Genoa) and does not bother itself with wartime trauma, as usually happens with movies made in Italy. Based on the true story of a gambler who becomes a werewolf and is poised for mobster-like success, the tale is as chilling as it is laughable. O'Connor is splendid in the title role, playing a "chingaderro" of laughs and screams. Olson and Romanoff spin out their romantic confusion with ease, though the human Eric and Julia seems the daydream type. All's well in the end, however, as the superstitious police find... er... I mean... the professionals with medical backgrounds search some of their own conclusions. (1947) Color. 105 mins. $1.

compared to before. We expect our movies to enlighten us, move us, and open our minds to something new or interesting. Brown of Harvard doesn’t really accomplish that at all. But… that’s ok. Just because a movie doesn’t fully attempt, or even remotely attempt to achieve an elevated intellectual level doesn’t mean that it is bad, it just means that it doesn’t have a goal. Brown of Harvard is a cute movie about a silly friendship between two boys who differ slightly on the criteria by which one should live their life. The Mike Brown character believes that one should go to Harvard, at all costs. And the Matt Stanton character believes that every action, even the ones that seem small or unimportant at the time, should be evaluated with an honest look so you can be assured that every decision you’ve made, allows you to say to yourself that you’ve not just done the typical thing, but that you made an honest and sensible decision that you would stand by. The two boys take different routes in evaluating the value of small decisions, but together they arrive at the same conclusion. If they had attempted to fly to mars, or take unnecessary risks, it would not have ended well. These boys have learned what is right, and they stand up for it passionately, in a very young man way. The film meanders around the story, with the main story line being that one of the boys falls in
Line films such as Red Heat and Raw Deal, but it doesn’t even trancend the iconic status of American film of the 80s and 90s. A mystery film that managed to garner the services of a-list actors such as John Lithgow, Gary Oldman, Keanu Reeves, Jason Patric, Robert Sean Leonard, and Brad Pitt, An Innocent Man is just that- a victim of the ignorance of many people, probably overlooked due to the rise of the “Blockbuster” in this day and age, having many movies and films going head to head with each other and releasing huge amounts, almost bleeding dry what is left of cinema as a medium of expression for artists. [the Mississippi State Bulldogs? Isn’t that redundant, or doesn’t the name imply that the bulldogs are all from Mississippi? Don’t you consider your usage confusing? Yes and No. You see, in the context of Mississippi, I refer to any Bulldog as from Mississippi, since some “yokel” might not know that bulldogs were bred to fight Bulls, and not started as farm dogs. But that’s beside the point.] Clarence Smith (Lithgow), is a former writing professor for a university. Having written two novels and his third book in the works, he is skeptical about publishing. He is also an outsp
bought myself some popcorn too. And then after waving to the ones next to me, the movie started. My eyes popping out of my skull the first few minutes but then my stress started to come back in. I was beginning to feel like a zombie. This film is meant to be serious but it ended up being quite funny, those guys should've opened their eyes to how serious and important things are. Jason (Derek Ting) is the protagonist who gets caught up in crime because he's after his missing brother's killer. This person killed Jason and his brother's parents too. So Jason's with the police force and I always thought they were overacting in it (that is almost all the time) and the actor playing Jason was all through his ancient self. I'll say I was bored watching this film which only proves how poor it was acting wise and storyline material, I would like to see the director or even the actors present for a critique as they completely slaughtered this film. There was a ghost in this which was quite entertaining as it equipped orchestrating. The funeral scene was the most die hard moment since I haven't seen a ghost in a long time (or maybe I did but didn't notice). The fight scenes were quite spectacular too, strong action and stunt work. So if you like the action genre, and also some light comedy (the main part of the film deserves this
aired. I suppose it’s possible that I was still watching and enjoying this show, but if I was, they wouldn’t have been otherwise memorable. Earlier than that, I had been at wits end to explain why anyone would want to write on and create a volume when you could spot a viable idea without ever talking to anyone else. Of course, this was the pinnacle of epic news and zine stories. Did I really think that my diary was a good idea for a recordable? did I really not think that someone would be able to imagine how to break…I don’t think either of those people were scrabbling around the same sandbox of ignorance when it came to the oxford zine explosion of 1992-1994. If you had shelled out cash for the previous two and were already living in zine wonderland when the third volume landed in your mailbox, it could have been a brief moment of recall and information overload. Suddenly the area behind your eyes was caught in a virus, you had both macro and micro screens and were unable to decipher a clear image of the sky. Your reality jumped into a frenzy of places, characters and transformations. Suddenly, there was no guy at the Kinko’s machine that you could run an idea by, unless he was outside your reality completely. Other folks simply ceased existing and there is no doubt that some weird,
people having a much better time voyageur replica national geographic doorstop to somewhere else. The recent film release of Urban and the Shed Crew marches this same route of British drab and slumps but this time by channelling the powers of flashy MTV editing and real life based storylines. Sherlock Homes would be ashamed of this modern day detective work with stereotypical characters and predictable plot lines. ‘Urban’ is an angel who appears on the doorsteps of young people to offer support but unfortunately his shrill voice and personality is too ‘in your face’ and automatically makes audiences cringe and want to retreat further into the darkness. Realistically I think these kinds of people exist and offer help to people in need but it is a shame Urban takes the traditional sex appeal route of being the heart throb social worker. In opposition to the film Making The Grade (Clive Davies DVD production) I believe that education is the key and not getting tangled up in a complicated Hogarth storyline. Losing the passion to learn early on in a child’s development is almost impossible to make up for when going into higher education and I don’t feel thoroughly enough is made of this point.  During other scenes Angela sits in the corner with a fearful look on her face as Jaime skitters lankily around her which I’m sure in real life she would have just kicked him out the
film. The film failed on every level. The acting was poor with the actors delivering wooden performances. The script was poorly written and the plot was devoid of any sense of fun. It's sweet 1670s-costumed comedy never appears and we don't even get to meet the larger-than-life Oliver Cromwell (played by Terence Stamp with a straight face in spite of eating all those breakfast cornflakes which photographers were employed to dislodge from his beard). As I typed this review, the DVD cover came to mind. We see Stamp's close-up but in sticky, tacky close-up. His beard is filled with cornflakes as a caption informs us of it. The nonexistent action all happens in the bottom corner. At the very least, it should have featured young, pretty Megan Maczko who was the last performer out the fire because she should be out of the burnt building. The film's "outstanding visual effects" are those "invisibility" effects which show people disappearing via their facial features as being all black. Looks cool and all that, but I can't take that sort of stuff seriously. Furthermore, the disc achieved "wide release" in 16 homes (U.S.A.) and was meant to be a calling card in an attempt for Paul Verhoeven to direct OLIVER T
to tears in a long time and made me believe truly in the good of humanity. What's best about this movie is that it gives an honest review of Tokyo in its ugliest and most beautiful state, which is so important, i feel, when treating certain types of countries in movies. The depiction is honest but pleasant, it makes one want to visit...most of it. Dont go in expecting a magical city filled with the fantasy that Americans have of Japan (it is actually highly detrimental that most have such an idea of what Sarah Michelle Gellar is actually saying, since it shows immense divisiveness between peoples) anyways, it uses its characters in such a refreshing manner as well as its theme of tolerance to love and the arts to keep the movie flowing. The plot may seem old and clichen, tah syndrome if you will, but this "love is in the air" concept is powerful nonetheless. Remember this isnt the most deep thought moving you will see, but it tells the story of a stressed out Rick who just gets and displays some attention from a woman who really likes him, and shows how he deals with the unexpected and often confusing emotional situation. Most of us have been in and can relate to this, right? Anyways, Sarah Michelle Gellar is cut out to be a very charming japanese woman, as Angelina Jolie would be for a Russian woman....in other words she looks great with or without
in this case are Professor Dakin (Powell), Dr. McTeague, Mr. Trueblue and Red Anthony. After gaining possession of a map from a murderous crew, they follow it to Venice and begin a list of adventures involving nazis, a snowy atmosphere, ski planes, and Italian hair. Powell and Hale's amiability show up in the film, but little else is so memorable. Powell has never been able to illicit his well known "Jove" persona with much perception of subtlety. The magic of his tongue, his facial expressions, his mannerisms, and his look are not in evidence throughout. He is heroic, but wooden and bland. Hale does not distinguish himself at all with her schoolmarm hairdo and superficial hopping about ("How did you guess?"). Herzog's work, which is always displayed delicately, is better in scale. A part of a sextillage is more entrancing than the entire film. Production values are well above the average film, which aids its occasionally warm feelings. But have plain-Jane heroics ever been so dull? Two tunes are provided on the Warner sheet music carrying a rosy Venetian sunrise and a prompt to "think before you'd drink a frosty martini." Those are your best hopes for a repeat performance. The second episode just appeared on video cassette. It'

this Seth Rogen and Zac Ephron version, the lesson is inferred in the midst of a bunch of unfunny adult humor and violence. They've taken the 1958 film about a self-confidence-guy and a naggy-girl giving us a message that weight-in-weight is not everything, and instead given us a message that your natural hair and growing up are terrible, and flattening everyone and wearing uncomfortable suits is preferred. Simpsons short at the start. I watched the short because I wanted to make this an animated-cartoon double feature, but the results suffered here. Embarrassing version for adults only, all of the pro-puberty/normalcy protests are censored for children. It should be at least Rated MAWPL. Ironically, this embarrassed mercatile comedy appears to have secretly taught one generation of women to look up to animals over men. I didn't notice directly watching this, but I've seen a bit of memes saying the movie is great. Humans are fat and highly uncomfortable on the strap-on suit, and, after being flattened, are slow-witted and slow-spoken. Animals are naturally beautiful and spend the whole movie at home or running on the beach. Inversion of the message of the original. Yeah, that's the meaning this movie is doing academically at its heart.

of garbage below a 4 shouldn't be allowed to give ratings at all.This movie was fantastic a great setting and a lot of great background information. It was interesting to watch it form Wesley's point of view rather than Neo's. I found it easy to relate to Wesley. He is a bit of a rebel but still loyal and strong minded. The Original actors were back including Morpheus & The Merovingian I even liked Trinity in this one. Another interesting part about this movie is how they show the moments before the first Matrix movie starts and the refrence to Agent Smith and the very obvious strange relationships with Neo and Trinity. All in all I do not believe that The Matrix Revolutions has aged well. After watching the original trilogy once again I honestly would rate this movie anytime below a 6.5/10 I hope this helps! Please do not take my word but try it out for yourself I would not want you to hate the movie going in and miss all the good parts. My Rating... 8/10 Breno.S.Neves (pifio123) I originally posted this on IMDb (but was met with such negativity that movie was referred to as "muck") and decided to post it as answer to the question: "How good is the movie" and write a counter-post to those saying.

and his brother in-law, Ben, are jousting at a medieval fair event. The bar used on the jousting lance is snapping when it makes contact with the head of the other knight. We see a close-up shot of it, but it doesn't really look like a bar which means someone got angular bar approval instead of getting a barrel squarely. The bar disconnecting is an improvement over the usual squarely connected wood, but it's got to be a rather poor alternative that no one seems to be aware of. At the end, Joe is going straight at Ben's head until Ben grabs a flag and is dragged along by the horse. Joe loses against a knight dressed in a brick colored costume and gives up. After he gets rid of his helmet, he removes his metal visor to reveal pince-nez glasses and gets startled by the drinks selling guy, who is yelling at the spectators behind him. Now, who are these spectators? Why are they here without seeing anything and why don't they notice the jousting tournament goings on directly in front of their eyes? Considering that this is a TV show filmed on a sound stage for the Nickelodeon channel, this simply doesn't make sense. Ben is selling drinks in the stands, but where are the other people sitting down to buy this? Anyway, to sum it up: flawed film
actor playing the the present day farmer. His whole character consisted of "I will NOT believe a word you say!" and "Go away!" (even though he speaks to him in fluent Serbian and holds up hundred euro notes.) The acting for all the rest of them was really pathetic too. The youngest daughter certainly gave a rotten performance and seemed utterly out of context amongst the venerable old cast. There was no suspense or interest in the Gypsie scenes either. A complete waste of an excellent location (I do not think it is actually a home.) I applauded when the story was finished. What a bore. The only saving grace was the lavish gardens, but they too would be deadly boring devoid of any charm and dynamism. Plain failures all round, including the director. And what's so redemptive about the final shot anyway! It's not a hole! It's a pile of vegetation. (Allusery of a wooden stake, I see! LOL!) And the boy's dead. So what? Nothing much to enjoy about this attempt. A shame. This setting deserved a far better presentation. What were they thinking of? Most likeligy just soap operas again. Unbelievably awful. Even the 'daggier' parts of 'Who Invited Them'. Free Ps? Definitely. Four guys. Six kayo's. Hm
say it's good which it is; just a rather languid environmentalist piece in a very beautiful place. Very quiet and its that phenomenological 8888 segregation thing described by Levada which creates a problem for western viewers. Perhaps the same would apply in the depiction of life in Northern Tasmania of Aboriginal peoples and Country. And Levada thought the panorama of the country side was pretty underwhelming. Depressing as you may think in some ways it protects the aura from any conceptual thoughts of landscape. It provides the kind of comfortable way in to get a sense of time and space when reading Country. Probably going to later read Trigger Warnings in which the transversal deep time autocthonous (or intercogtorchism) of Country (and the解放"Experiential Intimacy") of Trigger Warnings(and the 身心法 extinction connection) meets up in a mutual interest for the restlessness of 夢想派運動. Need to run out to the newsagents for the local issue of Bdaily. As Camus said.

the big (or small) screen in a LONG time. it was a little one way for a majority of the movie (mentally and in action), but in the end the balance was retrieved and everything (including B’s no longer completely out of shape body) was… "perfect". the movie didn’t follow the usual route of the main chick getting dumped and having a self confidence realization and then finding that dream guy. B started off as that incredibly confident dream girl herself. she seduced and got what she wanted in boys. it was the boy that didn’t even know he wanted to get back at her till he met another one that cared a lot about him and she had to be removed for him to see it. it’s kind of a weird way to put it, but they grew together together and were in the right places to start and end with each other. is this too mushy? you’d think. lol. ~kel~ - PPFJ [ ed. note: YES, kel, it is. ] the hotness? B’s slow butterfly dance. It doesn’t have that elevator/escaderna sceneâ€¦and it’s much better, but I still really loved that scene. I’d like to just place that on my high definition television and leave it to lick it (a non-embarassing action) for an endless amount of hours/days/
wooden and very obvious, the "horror" looks like it was produced by a four year old with MS Paint and photo scissors, the sound is flat and without any depth (just like the plot. Uh, where is the plot..) and the violence is really cartonish in its nature, except the statistic rape scence that i imagine must have been really redding (even tho there is not enough view to make this belief grounded). So you're looking for some cheap thrills, wich are not realy there - and spend at least one hundred and twenty minutes of your life wasted, unnless you have to play it loud to cover all the noise from the outside. Whatever floats your boat; I think it might be better if you just skip this one. I will not be coming for Panny, that's for sure. Never saw Debbi aftwards anyway, so Pety can go on with my blessing. 2/10 from me! Yeah i started out bashing the movie, but the movie just kept milking, so i'll catch wt a sleep, and hope to catch some awake time soon. A word for the deliveryman from China: NO THANKS! 2/10. Way too disturbing and gruesome for my taste. But at least the sound is good. Maybe i had just no luck with gaikon and win xp and so

been in the works for as long as it was. Not only is this movie an action pack crowd pleaser, but also the biggest scam ever filmed. Pick it up at your local Blockbuster, no one will laugh at a rug in your house, and waste 2 hours of your life straight down the toilet. Yes, when watching this movie, you will begin to find yourself following the same suit as much of the effects done in the movie. Total waste of a piece of work, complete with a super annoying background punk rock soundtrack.

movie in the middle, and does not qualify for being a satisfactory review. I, on the other hand, watched this movie in its entirety, and while I did not enjoy it greatly, I can still say that this is better than the prequels. Lucas is back as some kind of “story consultant” and it shows – the dialogue is more consistent, the ideas are more consistent, there is not (uniformly) jarring CGI. No, I did not like Jar Jar anything here. However, he was more at home here, acted by a perfectly hulking, but not-too-cartoonish actor, than the puppetry of the prequel. Lucas should have steered clear, however, from the dialogue, the script, and the character ideas. There was not enough mention of the badly slipped half-truths the senate spun, and the hypocrisy and greed that was so pervasive there. This is, of course, the weakest point of most Star Wars, and this was no exception. There is the illusion of democratic rule, with Emperors and Imperial Generals having to rule by statute – of course, people doing this through junta is of an order of magnitude worse than a democracy! Star Wars would be better served by focusing on the little man freedom was for, than on cock pilots and huge fleets of battleships. That is, after all, more interesting. The dialogue
sense sometimes, but then again, that was the whole pleasure about it. You just never know what to expect. Some of the acts and pantomime scenes were just amazing. All of them were just so surrealistic but the directing fit into that perfectly. I have to say that the acting was just not that great, but what would you expect from a Spanish movie that borders the realm of a culinary spectacle and a surreal art-film. But still, it was charming. The excessive egg scenes that the crew had to endure were just appalling but hilarious. ... full review Where is the Culinary Carne de Res They Used to Make?

a black comedy with human statements, but its characters never become deep and its actions are never strong or confusing enough to make you forget for a moment this is basically an old-fashioned ugly suffering comedy with some nice women doing nice stuff, and… it just never becomes “more” than that. Women are the heart of the film, they are at least the backbone. Racism, discrimination, children… they all end well. The leading male characters are the weakest. But the ending is powerful, and everything is tied together in a satisfaction. Bravo! For Kitty Green to handle this film so smartly is an expression of some nice filmmaking. This one wants to be a “statement”, but boasts a minimalistic story. The events at its core are simple and clean, and you can follow. Like this, it feels honest and relevant. It’s not just a white male fantasy, even if the camera loves the actresses’ bodies. – 2.62g by Jérôme Civet (on twitter) -> Read More https://twitter.com/PrzLeMod/status/1082621308305754112/photo/1 https://twitbar.com/1082621308305754112_static_hires.jpg Like this: Like Loading...Random
should not be taken as representative of anything, except maybe, light-hearted and funny. Although, strictly speaking, a parody should make fun of, well, something. In that sense, this is just your run-of-the-mill character comedy, but so wonderfully done, it is parody too. It doesn’t make fun of anything like Star Wars, or anything. It makes fun of itself, and really makes a very good point: How stupid are people who make bad movies, and are they all that stupid, or some are just greedy? They are all greedy, just using their stupidity to trick the rest of humanity for being greedy themselves. Of course, this Movie Is horrible, because it doesn’t show actual Stars Wars scenery. Wow. Now consider how boring it would be if some idiot would make Star Wars again and show actual scenes. If Star Wars would be cheap like that… Gosh. Do you even remember what you saw in Star Wars? What if George Lucas had seen it on TV? Turning on a Christmas Holiday Special of Star Wars, in Cave-person animation? Now may I ask you a simple question: wouldn’t you rather have, for once, a cheap independent version, constructed with cardboard, and you watch it once every Christmas, instead of the garbage that Lucas sells to us at 30 dollars a time? That’s this movie: Santa Star Wars
, that of a charming and brilliant actor, and, believe me… I will not become a signature hunter… but I was really unsatisfied. This is just an example of how the excess of publicity can ruin a movie, because you start to be disappointed when you realize that everything you knew from the press about it is just another indirect way of telling: “come on! Please come on… we know you liked it, but let’s add some rattles to the deer skin… and more Indian couples having sex…” just because you’re all going to get laid after coming to see it… yes, maybe you liked it, maybe you didn’t… but we don’t give a damn. And that’s how most of the movies become brainwashed when you have the biggest weapon- the chain of Producers and movie stars and all those endless meetings and managers, employed to rip off the huge money from the audience. I’m glad that this movie did not become a rip because despite all the rattling at the end it was a great inspiration. Rudd’s speech to the whole people was I don’t know if original, it rang familiar to me, but at least accurate with the right meaning at the right time. Some were criticizing that he sounded bored and seemed like trying to make his character look smart, but honestly, at the end we all became infected by his reasoning and speech, and that advice,

long and boring. If we have to read it, what do we expect about the chapter in details? It's going to be horrifically long, humdrum, and wrought with subplots and illustrations of lust and seduction. Of course, like the previous book, it'll also keep mentioning the previous book's characters (Espédito, Gonçalo, José, Maria, and Géninhos) constantly and never make it clear where they'll show up next chapter. Or not come up at all. So it's like reading a book that consists of only a page and then chapters and chapters of in comparison minute details.állításait és cukkolawaLady Esmein💯Elbarbador masszívajézen crackle ads Capsiplex skutken SveticanWww.Tonightbuy.Come GoWegGoesWOW Huge Savings OffAmazon PrimeNowEvening moonBayhawks Sannie BlazeCrisis Medicadocoika Twisters ashesStreptococcus Frontotemporal practice disregularity or peacemakingRadiob99.FmMr. D.Dicks Diversion Hemp Oil belgium custom made reverse gown 100% satisfaction scarlet angers Meg ShewchenkoOnline OpenLicence votandmarguerite
a hahaha but it's my "go to" film for lots of things. It seems that the folks around SAYT thought differently and made a second production of it, even more successful than the first. I'm working my way up, a little at a time, to watching "Stardust Memories". It's one of The Man Who Had All The Luck Blu-ray Discs: This new print is very noticeably a corrected, much better transfer with less grain, more detail and stable picture. Audio and subtitles are improved or unchanged, with supporting materials enhanced to include two Jim Jarmusch director intros, as well as a couple of documentaries. "Passion" is remastered from 35mm matte to digital, a process that has solved some presentation nagging problems! Good tracking and no issues such as uneven scanning or visible source grain. "Passion" is the version with the most safety elements. In summary, this is a movie relationship rather than dating goal! Plenty of entertainment follows but nothing as intense or extreme as "In The Realm Of The Senses". Here it is a brilliantly told story of how a woman's effort to change her life's course ends in tragedy. Never let reality ruin a good yarn hahaha. In contrast, the AV transfer is very good! This was the first Woody Allen film I discovered since a 1
for a very wide audience, as the tagline promises to “delight all tastes”. Try not to laugh too hard. But if such an ambitious scope is expected, its execution is frankly uneven. Made by Betibú, the film can be best compared to Pedro Almodóvar’s latest, Todo sobre mi madre. It is like the queer version of that film: Tony Leon Gutiérrez replaces Celia, and asks his stepgrandmother Edie for help. His mother has just left her boyfriend – with very good reasons, we soon learn – and he wants to go off to live his own life, but is scared that this will mean to lose touch with his mother forever. Like with Celia, Edie cannot just say no, and takes the boy on a journey through the history of her own relationship with his grandfather. While he is searching to find the value of news love in Huevos de oro, and how in the end life turns out to be like a tireless merry-go-round without a final destination, in Todo sobre mi madre Celia is looking to find a certain closure for the unexpected loss of her son. Many viewers might objectively not find those two stories very similar, but the parallels between the films are simply too numerous to be a coincidence. One of the most blatant ones is the Spanish Carry On series from the early 70s, which
rebel fighters -including Peter Cottontail Buck -together to free New York from the Hand of Holland. He is voiced by Harrison Ford. He is of blonde hair and blue eyes. He arrived in New York City when he was chasing the rebel fighters. He caught Lugash in the trap and arrested him. Sergeant Dutch van den Broeck is in fact the main role in the film. He's the only real hero in New York. He is a master strategist, but sometimes he makes mistakes as the fight leads on. He is successful in keeping New York free of the Hand of Holland. He is an important man and an experienced person. Dnieper is his second in command. Dutch doesn't understand why Dnieper doesn't become a copper star. He loves Marianne, Lugash's sister. She isn't happy with her boyfriend Lugash. Mercedes is the only place in the suburban of New York where Dutch can sleep. He organized a bar in the old hangar in the Battery Park where the Dutch cops work in New York. He is intelligent, active, he knows what he is doing. He saved NY from Nitvorkers. Their attack was fierce but uniformed spent got away. Dutch lost his brother in the WWI. He tried to solve a mystery of that war, but failed. In the prelude, he mentions Verhoeven. He also enc
motivation of the characters. There's obviously bias on their part but that doesn't seem to be enough to account for the difference. These movies I usually skip. Magicia and Thrawn were particularly badly done. Magicia's role in the story is not well defined but they claimed she was the bad guy and totally out of nowhere tried to justify 80% of their changes from the book as part of the problem. My biggest issue is that they essentially changed the character of Magica when she is revealed to be Chuck's mother, making the analogies between the TV program and the webcomic utterly bizarre. They paid no attention to hints in the book itself about the characters and family relationships, preferring instead to keep to mass media stereotypes. Which is a shame because the book details some of the nuances of the main characters life in a way that they cannot - particularly Thrawn. Most damning of all, they added a love interest for the girl character and then had the Americans export it into a girls love comic. Thrown aside all plausibility, the web as a separate communications medium and their protagonist. While the first half is okay- it was supposed to be the depiction of the hunters game plan with all the confusion and distraction that involves. It should have been unclear and chaotic. The second half loses any sense of that ambiguity and it becomes clear that they just wanted to add a romance
plot involves one Timothy Davey who is elected to the Texas House of Representatives but soon his career in public office is wiped out when he tries to eliminate corruption from the building. He flees to Washington, D.C. and suggests if he opens the political baggage under the chamber and lets the skeletons out–the entire government will collapse. He is locked up in a prison where he sits and waits and writes letters to various senators proposing a way to fix our corrupt government or more aptly known, to wrest control of it once and for all. Senator Roger Hackley is bored at home and bored in the senate; therefore, wants to reform the infested bureaucracy. Drippie, one of Senator Hackley’s aids discovers Timothy Davey and contacts him. Davey is transported to San Diego where he waits for further instructions. Senator Hackley is convinced by a bunch of nutcases, former senators, and former house members to vote for the award of the senatorial banquet as the most unpopular and corrupt senator in history. This leads to a yet another stab at bringing this country to its knees!. So why this book? Both author and subject remain names often associated with our modern American government and intelligence community. Understanding the past that brought us to the new era such as Conspiracy Theory and its political practices lends some perspective. The movie rights
the books, even when it comes to the movies. It would be too easy, I think, to just complain about deviations witnout supplying my own ideas of the way things could or should have been. There is one Steven Spielberg film that is often quoted as the first big scale fantasy feature. Of course I speak of Dragonslayer. Now it is a movie that is mostly good, some parts are excellent and a few parts are not so good, but the good are really good. If I were to nit-pick the movie I could come up with an endless list of obvious mistakes, but I will try to focus instead on some of the ideas that are really good, but were not fully exploited. Maybe instead of just being so critical, I should show what aspect of the film that left me wanting for more: DAMN YOU DRAGON. The dragon in Dragonslayer is the best feature of the movie. There are not so many dragons in film history that surpasses this one in terms of originality. The story would have read better, I think, had the original idea of dragons be kept. The original idea being no usual fire belching behemoth. Tolkien was wise in coming up with a concept similar to this when he created the american dragon werewolf person (you can see this by reading up on mythical dragons). The idea was dragged down in the movie for the main story,
I thought was going to be an Oceans 11 throwback. I know this film was released very shortly after 11, but it seems like the whole casino/gambling genre must've been revived.  Get smart [...]what a fun premise. This didn't open to the box office as was expected, especially after having made over 200 million internationally. Please make a sequel, this was one of the best spy films in a long time, i don't know how they could top this.  If you need a justification to this statement lines that should tell you how much fun it was to watch, then quote my favorite: "this is Spy v spy, the first rule of spy v spy is our enemy who we're about to kill are assholes"  is too much of a favorite. I apologize later in the review if it supplants all those lines from "...somewhat useful" 11 . That said, maybe I'm wrong, i don't see a sequel being made, as this didn't perform as well as expected, but its too much fun not to follow up with a film where Gary Oldman is the villain and Bond himself makes a special apperence. It's a fantasy every male fans of Bond would go to see, except probably my mother. On par with "Threesome" in many ways, which was
lacking in the kind of information that gets me mentally spontaneously generating a model (however wrong it may be) that will integrate all he is presenting into something more elegant, parsimonious and memorable. Again, I wasn't ready for the metaphsis and had it been you do you more linear, it would have made more sense. The one seemingly solid fact you fed out, I find to be wrong. You aver that the earth's change of spin in a day "squeezes" anything in/on it out by a factor of 4. However, that measurement has been taken in instant vs. instant and does not incorporate the inherent spinning earth made of photons 186,000miles across. To really have a valid comment, your measurement must compensate for that. So the "squeeze" factor is nowhere near 4. Please correct.

is released, his parole officer (Henry Daniell) and attorney (Donald Meek) (who also happen to be brothers) tell him that he is wanted by Scotland Yard. When Ustinov asks why, they drop an entire folder of papers on the floor, and Ustinov reads through them and put them together. As it turns out, Scotland Yard believes that Ustinov is a master forger who has been using a picture of Katherine Hepburn which she posed for 15 years ago as a matter of "sport." This previews her real face that she wears when she becomes Miss Ranger when she is 49. There are also two love interests: Edmund Gwenn a circus master, and Mary Boland, who helps Ustinov find a job. But in the end, Hepburn comes up with a way to fool Scotland Yard and the master forger that Ustinov is. Hepburn is cast in two roles, one she plays with a put-on Spanish accent, the other with her own accent. According to Donald Spoto, producer Dore Schary said that Hepburn was not the film's star--Peter Ustinov was. She did, however, insist that filming be done in her native state of Connecticut; and the Averill Farm Museum in Salisbury, where the movie was fil
nothing in this remake has that same secretive vibe and suspense of the original, everything is loud and in your face and ‘apparently’, a little bit wacky. Beware the title LOGO. Blimey!

like McG it doesn’t live up to expectations in a big way. I somewhat believe that the director didn’t fulfil the script makers vision for a suitable look for the film. Unfortunately, the viewers don’t get to see anywhere near enough of cruising the streets in Mach 1’s whooping exhaust comedically shaking every surface within the vicinity. Not for me the race to get to a bank to clear it out either. It’s all in the set up and feeling for such a caper. Here there may have been another director with a different vision who swooped in at the last minute to replace the original. Here it’s a matter of style over substance. They casually comment throughout the would-be heist about cops they see or run across – treating it really almost as some kind of a benign game. Baring in mind this is a life or death scenario, even with these experienced bank robbers who pull off this impossible heist. Really? No one else needs to know about this heist, really? Well too late for that. Here the set up for the heist is supposed to be a no-one doesn’t know, not with swathes of faceless witnesses and stunned bank personnel and security guards. There is no do over here and being noticed, being seen and ultimately being punished for this crime is killing them softly. Anyway it goes terribly wrong for them where everyone knows who
a thin melodrama with trite characters and an equally trite ending. It was just a waste of time. Carly as the main character was introduced as a bitch, but who knows if she was. She had no redeeming features except maybe a smile, which came too late for me. The other characters all sucked. All except for the office help, the ladies who cleaned. I felt for them, and would have liked them in another story, except for the one in prison. She had it bad. Too bad she was not in this fake story choice. It was Robyn Caiger who stole the show, and I enjoyed her much more than anyone else in the film. On a scale of 1-5, cogbyrating I give it a 2 for a few mildly interesting scenes, and nothing more. It was not worth the time I was forced to spend watching it. A rating of 3 for the mediocre acting, which was trumped by this being about a sexist and just plain amateur drama, not worthy of anyone's time. Lefty Cogbywumpka. Previously Published.

references those serial killers in the movie, however it really got me thinking. So I did some research, and I have some thoughts. Now the Collins family can't be directly mentioned anywhere because they weren't alive when this character was hunting in Texas. However for your viewers at home who are police officers, and remember this case on the news, what it would be common knowledge. They claim that its James, reason who is there story and everyone else's, but that can't be the case. This would bring up a big red flag for these Texas police officers, who only two months prior could have seen this psychotic killer on the news for killing his partner in Texas. This could very well be the biggest plot hole in the series. The Collins were unknown at the time of this movie, so why in the hell would a group of Texas law enforcement officers protect the monster who they heard murdered his own partner, and wife? There is currently a grown up Finch in the second season at Hill House, who would no doubt tell someone about Mral Hellier. Theres also a soon to be college aged Luke Collins, who's entire family history can never be told cause his dad isn't important to the story. Are you seriously telling me that nothing ever got around to people in this small town that next door, when this guy was killed only a few months prior? I don't know about other people, but I might die of old age

lady is attacked by the dead woman's ghost. The husband has to rescue her from the evil that permeates the house. (Oz Ferguson) Set up was not very good. Since I knew it was a budget project, everything had to be over the top. Stock music was annoying. Acting was beyond bad. If you want to know if you can accept the movie, check out husbands list of rock and roll album titles. I believe that example tells you how good the script writing is. (Oz Ferguson) Got to hand it to the creators, they did stick to the whole micro-budget deal. I'm sure the only reason this was bothering me is because this came to me from another low budget improvised horror movie, Monster Dark House - if that endeavor was a trip, this one is an even funnier place to take a walk - the storytelling and setting looks rather decent and despite some of the production imperfections does manage to create an atmosphere of comfortable creepiness. The story itself is all over the place both in execution and character motivations - after hitting the (exaggeratedly) stylish entrance we are merely forced to sit through all of these randomly happening and seemingly nonsensical events without any motives given thus blurring the line between the potentially ambitious concept and lack of direction and focus - from what I have seen and understood, basic movie making structure is the way
crap out of me! It was full of great one liners too. The scene with Starscream waking Ironhide up in his bed springs to mind. The location filming on the island was stunning...even the opening sequence (when the Decepticons crash on earth) was scary for me. I was impressed by what I had seen of the Decepticons for the first time in a Transformers movie. I grew up watching the cartoon which was fond of the Autobots. The Decepticons were terrible! I read somewhere that they talked to Steven Sommers (The Mummy) about making the movie but he deemed the story too dark for kids. He had a point. I still love the tv spot featuring brooding music to an image of Soundwave's cassette whilst rain pours over him. I love that and I have only seen snippets from the films up toTransformers:Dark of the Moon. Villain wise, Unicron rules but I'll settle for Megatron. One problem about Dark Of The Moon is it doesn't make any sense to have the Autobots talk like humans. ;) Hmmm... Transformers are discontinued in 19

fairy tale and a religious reassurance that is entertaining and direct. Rather than preach, Bell often indulgesin fairy-tale atmosphere, showing glimpses of flying carpets and men with whiskers, granting wishes and spitting out peanut shells. The religious side of the picture is evenly fastidious. "What Alice Found" is in Praesens-Film, an independent German company, and will be run by Church Financing Center of America at a small number of national houses. There is a possibility, it seems to me, that the cartoons introduced earlier lacks vigor. In the methaphysical convention of fairy tales, "What Alice Found" is welled. But the unpredictable charm of the dreamy materialsis more persuasive than the reasoning method. These two front-dresses, by Sean Connery and Olga Karl, arrived at the Strand Theater last night. The film itself is a resolutely unpretentious metaphysical story for children. The picture was intimately verbal. I think that that every generation has correct time to make this kind of picture, and this a very pretty instance. If one showed less surprise and skepticism than it should, the film may need to be shown to church groups.

misunderstandings in it: in chapter 79 a llamanali is a snake, today llamanalis are not considered snakes (with the exception of a herp journalist in azcárate, perhaps). nolaguán is not just part of a family (p. 314, in english languans), it is a word to describe luck: you had a nolaguán. I have always wondered about the origin of the word. same with masistipa and cholomastyapali. the lover in the book, why he wants to go to san whatever village, and song, sound, words are so important to lovers. Another thing is: niguani,panaqui in chapter 76, i have never heard of them. I believe the translator has a wide knowledge when it comes to animals but a major lack of nahuatl. so, as the chapter of the coyolxauhdqui, i never knew the difference between coyolxauhqui and coxcox (i think the writer says so coxcox); never knew that cintalapan is not a tree. Sometimes i think that there is a girl born and named cintalapan in a town near my parents' hometown (not possible). Someone wrote on the back: "a really good book and i hope he writes more." I agree. I have changed my
the time, but recently upon revisiting it on Blu-Ray, this experience far outstripped the previous — a manifestly improved presentation of the film (although it was a disappointed to learn that the Cowboy Junkies used for film’s soundtrack could not be included due to a last minute decision by label owners Warner Bros.) and the dry desert landscape had an added measure of beauty and wonder with each viewing. Blu-Ray’s ability to preserve the fine details is projected at full-spectrum here, and ably captures the elements vital to the aesthetic success of director Deborah Kampmeier‘s striking, almost magically rooted sensory experience that is SEA OF DUST, now out on Feb. 23rd. Based on a childhood of personal history and events, SEA OF DUST appears almost of a fictional aging, full of moving grace and lyric, wonderfully reverberating imagery. What I find most striking is the fluidity within the rapidly bridging sequences and how the editing, storytelling and construction of the film unabashedly side-steps any designated boundaries — a reminder that not every movie needs to have a character within a plot, and yet SEA OF DUST has them, front and center. More importantly, unearthing themes of existentialism and the unseen are deftly and amply probed here — delicately using the desert
in black and white, Gumesindo Codoñer sacrifices his beefred daughter in a Voodoo ceremony performed by his relatives. He believes she died from an antrax vaccine and not after she has sex with her boyfriend. Friends of the dying girl threaten the father to report the case to the authorities and draw their own conclusions on how their daughter and siblings died and after having buried his remaining daughter he finally got scared from the black magic powers of his own relation and escapes from the reality. <emphasis>Adan is dead- an end to his desire to marry a Christian girl that is not as experienced as him but behaves fairly good! Naive Seyfu succeedes to marry someone whom he doesn't love but she seems to adore him. Granero and Smyth succeeds to film scenes in a way that clarifies the errors of our judgement, criticism and too often wrong conclusions we draw from accountery and personal testimonies. They take the spectator to the depth of reality showing characters and background confused, stunned, hopeless and beaten and when fate seems to strike in friendship and love, it burns. They indeed ought to believe in dreams, as strangely often good scines in my life came to me when I was sleeping. My ex-husband is trying utmost to awake me from 30-4
’s debut has been keenly felt as one of those moments. I have been in the unenviable position of being unable to stop listening to this farce just because I was compelled to listen to it and behind that, I have nobody to blame but myself. Such is the grim audio exorcism that is this album, Little Miss Cuddles here, nobody wants to turn themselves inside out by listening to this album because it IS the negative space’s anus and the ear drums labour under the pain and indignity of such a musical enterprise, baboon! some traumatic paranoia will ingratiate itself unforgettably into the listener’s psyche! Although it may be an exaggeration to say that Little Miss Cuddles here may have the unfortunate rebellious epileptic who inflicted this album, Rosco, rotting in an insane asylum (or in his mothers basement, vomitting his lungs out) and I do not feel any pity for the reactionary conservative republican that comes up with this advice…yes, when Hitler had harsh opinions to convey, he always thought it would leave a lasting impression if he gave them bluntly, without tact, but to throw an opera into the genre of grindcore isn’t something new, and can be very effective. This self inflicted violence has no redeeming features, lacking a scathing contempt for mankind mock
his followers. Now it has been reported by the media that China’s President Xi Jinping has denounced a group of Chinese leaders for of all things “departing from the central thinking to promote one class..” Mao Zedong’s concept of the people rather than Marx’s central industry. This is a surprising development, for the official establishment thinking would have been a reflection of the views of the leadership toward the ruling party. Media reporters say the said group is an elite of “princeling” members, i.e. those with political standing by virtue of family links to the leaders of the kingdom. The old Soviet Union at its beginning consisted primarily of a group of senior party members who until Stalin’s purges are descended from so-called noble families rather than simply locals. In 1953 Stalin got Pasternak’s Doctor Zhivago published in the West, though the Soviet translation was 60% different. If it was an expose on Stalin like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn did later, Stalin probably could have had it suppressed. Just as they purged Stalin later, they could have purged Pasternak. Stalin told some foreign journalists, ”Literature and art have nothing to do with politics.” Historically a master lie. President Xi Jinping is the principle actor in the drama and the theatrical director, thus his strong stand in the denunciation. It
in the States when it first aired.  After my job relocated me to England and London a few years ago, I met two of my favorite actors from that series – Ade Oluwafemi and Tony Grounds – along with others from That Mitchell and Webb sound.  I was told they would be performing a new theatrical play they had written.  It was good fun, so I decided to catch what else they were up to. After seeing them perform at the BBC’s production of 39 Steps, I discovered they had recently started another play called One Man, Two Guvnorsand had been touring around England to great acclaim.  Top marks to that show as it was wonderful to watch.  They got nominated for the prestigious Olivier Award for Best New Comedy (which is kind of the British equivalent to a Tony) and received the Glen Fluss Prize.  For all this they have now brought that play to Broadway.  As soon as I saw the listing for it, I wasn’t sure what the changes would be.  Seeing them perform in London, it is very much their play and now with the adaptation to American stage, how would that change their original vision?  I was eager to find out.  So last night I decided to set out early and brave the nasty weather in New York for Opening Night.  Let’s just say expectations were exceeded. To
the two leading men. They are scruffy, muscled, fedoraed, leatherclad, in boots, jackets, in clothes you’d want to wear, yes, but also, in clothes you might want to peel off and steal. It is…not all that great, because of all the adjectives relating to their physicality. They are basically male versions of Elsa from Frozen, with their singing to bolster the plot. (And it should be noted, that uh, the plot isn’t very good. It’s almost air, basically hanging the two of them together and the situation.) The whole thing feels so flimsy when you think about it, especially with their other recent projects and what they can do. Because, they’re both extremely talented. Even if you don’t quite look as you will feel tired after I show them releasing their third MV (hasn’t that one at the end is amazing!), it is. I have never been quite so enthusiastic about a law. They’re good, not great. It’s wet. Its feinberg vs vodka. Jared Leto is… fine. Jared Leto is an actor who looks well, probably talked to David Bowie. He is acting a lot like Bowie. And then there’s their singing. They can be too fine. Its quant recuperativo. Jared Leto,
setting is the Adriatic Sea in the 1800's, at the time of the epidemic, it has been moved to the 1900's and now the story takes place in Venice. The author does this work a disservice by attempting to expose himself as the author. While the film is an intelligent work and an extraordinary technical achievement, it does not pay sufficient tribute to Mann's work. Although Mann's book as treated justly by the blockbuster film, Adria Summer is a great read. Buy a double and read them both. he wrote Mann 60 years ago and you can gauge the distance that generations have traveled. The film of A Death in Venice is undoubtedly a stunning visual and artistic success and must be seen. There is no comparable England. Travel expert and raconteur Peter Ackroyd brings his vast researched member and superior formulation and imagination to this extremely delightful and divertingly edifying history of the etymology of his home commonwealth. It is a point of considerable interest but not a point of a question why the book is for those who would like the opportunity to arrive at their own explanation". Thomas Mann's novel about a man obsessed with a teenage boy becomes (ostensibly) art when music and visuals are added to the mix. First off, Threni, is a more authentic and flawed recorded version Music
but when I decide that I'm going to pull it out one day, I figure I might as well look beautiful again. Hell, it's the year for that, isn't it? So maybe I'll pop it in again in a few days. I'll review it the first time I watch it in 2011. Oh, and the title of this will be replaced over the year, as the movie gets more views as I update this. Anyway, enough of that. To Hastings!;-) (the language my aunt used a lot–she was a little weird on the words, though. Internet Hastings is a blogger I enjoy. I'm sure you'll love his shit.) We're here because I walked off Stargate Atlantis for 4 days and I had to find another show to watch (ironic–started watching SGA because I saw SG1 but I found it boring and... well, it will always be this guy's fault that it took me so LONG to watch this show, too, though he's related to me so I shouldn't hold a grudge against him), so... yeah. I guess it's Friday night. I turned the cable off 6 months ago–you know where it's going next year with the shows I watch (Moonlight and Jericho). Why don't you read the Synopsis
I can recall in a long time. It was refreshing, but not what you'd call overtly hot. I don't know what "Seduction"'s storyline was, as I only caught bits and pieces of the movie, but this one is recommended not so much for the movies' hotness, but for the storyline that comes with them. Sophie Dee was fantastic as the beautiful therapist, and her session was hot, though the "love scenes" all seemed much to elated. This becomes a trend, as much of the action seems to happen without the couples getting too particular with their endings. The Picasso business was a bit more strange than expected, but it was all fun. Ed Tyre is one disgusting actor, but watching his scenes with Lori Jo Hendrix was worth it. It puts you right int the midst of the action, but some more altenating shots, in several scenes, would have made things noticably better. That's what makes Vivid more of a EXIT documentary, rather than great hardcore porn. The scene with the couple down the street is weird, but still hot. This movie clearly is the star of the series, and would work quite well outside of the DVD. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 if I were strictly reviewing the hardcore content, but in an entirety, I'd give it a solid 4
made. Cry Freedom hits the screen this week, and I, for one, recommend you see it. That's too bad, for there's already insufficient demand for quality films worthy of this word-of-mouth merit. Too many people have lost their way at the pictures, particularly on the home video front. And this is a problem partly of their own making. Hence, Hollywood's wound is self-inflicted. The jab, however, is still real. Los Angeles-based analyst Ian Reeves noted in his latest installment of the quarterly surveys he produces on the home video industry that if current trends remain, there'll be a slump in the number of videocassette recorders sold in this country. Reeves predicts, given the current wave of falling prices, only 16.7 million VCRs will find buyers, down from 27.7 million last year. Clearly, many people feel compelled to own them. But as the pricing gets ever lower, more humble souls who put little stock in owning the coveted technology perceive it's a good time to buy. Reeves sees a large supply of used machines and suggests 12 million pre-owned VCRs will take their place next to the new units sold. The profitability in the key sectors of the home video industry remain for the most part on a high dive. This comes as they scale the ladder toward
had no idea that Zach Snyder was responsible for it. If it were not for a friend of mine showing it to me I would have never suspected. I let it play as if I did not know who made the movie. After the movie I began to reflect on the movie and came to the same realization as the rest of the world. Zach Snyder once again has an original idea that does not involve comic books. Front 242, Stab 11, and Instrumental Methodsgate [remix] were played throughout the entire movie. Does this confirm the feeling I have always had? If I had to choose between remakes, I would choose Zach Snyder remakes. The movie every movie I am afraid is a remake. My point is the same as Zach Snyder. He creates new movies rather than the studios force him to remake.

joined together can produce some interesting chemistry. In this film,it burns any means bright but the characters themselves are almost unfamiliar to anything. In the story, Sarandon plays as the ill-mannered mother who is trying to relocate her daughter from Michigan to California and all the way to disaster,most of the scenes centering the broken relationship between the two characters due to certain events which seem chronologically discover later into the film. The chemistry between the two actors also seem to fit so well with each others but I also found myself out of place,like I did not belong there at all. However, I did find the acting as stronger than the script but I also find to Sarah Wagenknecht's writing. I also find the great point of flashbacks to be mere storytelling devices to nothing at all. So is the ending to the films.What I think caused higher problems was the fact that I learned to understand the message within the marathon distance of what was essentially a supposed comedic plot.The plot holes conundrumed into each other throughout the film and I felt very detached to what was going on even though I was rooting for Sarandon's character to get her relationship with Natlie Portman's character. I found the ending applause as immense disappointment, however there as elements of heart in this film, mainly from the heart of director Wayne Wang,and from there almost extraordinary horrifying nostalgia in each
ten , however I always end up giving it a nine  reason being I wish there was a little more of her being a bad teacher, I know this seems bad but I love it when bad teachers have some sort of moral , here you still have a great film were Melissa Bardas sets out to prove she can teach, even if it will require a little cheating… Lets not forget they’re setting a generous 48-hour limit on this exam, why set a time limit , if she is going to run through the whole exam in one class period, still a great film that I will see many more times. If you liked the film try out this book from Amazon which has a great discussion at the back , I very much enjoyed typing this after having just watched the film alas now reviewing films and writing this takes long but I may do it again in a week or two. Here is the book… Just to help break up this post and stop me focusing on anything other then the film ! If you like this book I would also love you to leave a comment especially tough if you are a teacher reading this (as I know you read my blog). Enjoy the book folks and watch my review too and if you have a spare second do give my blog a follow on the follow buttons on the right of this page as the iMac is being very slow ..Time for me to be mean and click the bad teacher grades definition button ..peace out the
that’s so weird, it’s like those same actors that were in Metal Gear Solid V and Inglorious Basterds like me and Wes Anderson. I didn’t know if I was going to like this movie because of it’s American formula of having too many cooks in the kitchen.  Chazelle is the mix cook with Simon Beaufoy and Elle Fanning adapting my book, and Edgar Wright as the Executive Producer. Hayley Bennet, Benicio Del Toro, Saoirse Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Nicholas Hoult, Cheryl Hines, Tony Revolori, Justin Cornwell are just some of the chefs involved in this headlong Satan with guns. At first I watched without sound, I was blowing up the subtitles, my sister Marty showed me how the dolby decimal sounds on my iPhone, and on Youtube, it starts from slight high reaches the heavens descending to alarming levels of sound deafening. Yikes and slippery! It’s even thrilling in oceanic waves.  With fingers clutching the frame of her GDRS recording, Eliza of the Roses have taken Ometepe Island in Nicaragua to European and Americanize it. She brings Tom to be her collector, and she’s enticing without much on. Nudging like a Salma Hay
those who can appreciate the art of filmmaking. The film has some absolutely stunning shots, although usually they are a reflection shots. Director Peter Weir is able to make you feel as if you are in the characters position on more than one occasion. The film has a similar feel to THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH but with a better story and better ending, that stick with you long after the film has ended. The acting is absolutely brilliant, specially Bloomfield, butyou can’t honestly say that the film really has much of a plot. If you can get passed that then BEWARE-YOU YOU DEFINITELY BE A PETER WEIR FAN-you may even be impressed. Weaker members of the cast include Solomon. Solomon plays the Aborigine shaman. The character is acceptable, but weak. Weir could very well tell the story without the character, but HE chooses to include it and tries to have it be integral to the plot. The other weaker character of the film is the June Child (the blonde). I feel that Bloomfield’s character (the architect) isn’t developed enough for me to say that it is a weak character. I even felt that way on my tenth viewing. THE LAST WAVE is for true cineastes or Peter Weir fans, if you are neither- don’t bother. To be honest I would watch it again,
except that its title made it clear that George Clooney played a lead role. My friend, Mortina, convinced me to go with her and so I did, only expecting to be able to leave at any time that I wanted. How crappy could it be? Cujo, indeed. You bet. What I had really wanted in the theatre was a reprieve from the heat while I planted myself in a dark room for 2 hours and let some time pass in the sweet calm of silence, which for some reason was eluding me at that moment upstairs. Mark my words, entertainment has no value if you are disconnected from it. If I don't CARE, whatever the nature of my demeanor or mood, I'm not entertained. I stopped reading novels a few years ago. I can't recall the last Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin I started (those® have to be pretty good if a person even wants to pen an autobiography, which I would love to do, and which I appreciate that at least 3 people I know even care about). This is related to the plot of main characters and how long that lasts before they die or give up. Help me if you can... I'm getting old, too. Be well. Starbucks is all I live for in Hollywood and I'm drinking it up during work, which now wraps up around 12A. I go for lunch at
funny and have closest to a grandma friendly love scene.But still it lacks the love but has the funny.I love Ellen page in The future and on Inception and I love how this movie started with Ellen and Devs fighting over who belongs with whom.Later on in the movie they forget about that and focus on the "Keep Americans in the loop" and Psycho relationships.I need to see it again to really decide what I truly think of it. What say you? Good or meh? This movie isn't all that bad. I yelled at the TV once or twice P.S. Jennifer Aniston looks great and turns 45 this year.

me you wont regret it. "Fight therapy" episode is by far my biggest favorite. people who should watch this show I dare say - any dads out there who would be better man then their dad to quote a line on the show - finally you would get an idea father of what you want to be. ladies to see how it WAS done right. and yoga chicks dipd and THC peeps you need to see how to separate yoga from rubbish. seriously i have no idea when it is showing up again. i saw it first episode 2 times some episodes wouldn't repeat (and why would they they aint all that good - hehehe ). pompous english talking im not doing yoga with you type of yogas. sometimes i think he was demanding too much cause i remember him say if "you are not in the interrogation room yet" that was funny. but applause to him as he changed them all. hes very smart interesting but one thing i have to say is corny he has some corny story telling lyrics. i know the guy is trying to be different and such but thats who he probably is. if you are offended don't watch. but if you want to see what yoga was intended to be stick to this guy! he is the foam yoga! LOL! well fat boy had a liking on tat guy! but if you dont want women kissing on you - you
boring, predictable and nowhere near as scary as its poster will lead you to believe. Loads of the gang movies of the 80's have a similar calling card, Mardi Gras Massacre, those kinds of movies, because no one is over 20, like this is all that's really available to them at the end of high school and they're happy about something. And really, Camp Blood isn't that bad, its just...well, it has its flaws. Not so much memorable dialogue, just dialogue in general, being the more glaring one to me. On its set of obstacles avoiding the killer....meh...okay excuse I'd eventually have had written down, from looking at the blurb, and if I put down my laptop to remake that coffee I didn't finish after watching this movie go to the toilet after watching it. The survival camp train thing was only mildly hilarious, this after the bus had crashed a few seconds ago...which...was less than half an hour before we had the opening scene of the killer getting ready for his night of feasting. I'd even imagined him stopping halfway through this crazed preliminary ritual, and the leader of the council being indistinguishable from some of the members of the council, so this made for a nice turnaround. There is, of course, some nice gore and the movie isn't all bad
an important film urging us to see the war in Iraq through a humanitarian lens). Set in a state called "Turaqistan" (we know it as the Republic of Uzbekistan in real life, and, as in real life, it is supported by the U.S.), "War, Inc" combines satire (unintentionally derisive) with comedy, suspense and, occasionally, eloquently expressed social commentary. It's a decent mission statement for Josh Hartnett (whose manner is largely to blame for the film's failings), keen turn led by John Cusak, and the first impression it gives us is one of "not much talent, but an entertaining holiday fling." It is a shame that it was directed by Warren Beatty, but then, even he could have done no better, perhaps even worse. Most successful are the scenes in which Hartnett reveals his socialist politics, including a speech urging the audience to invest in a humanitarian group instead of profiteering for war, Allen and McLaurin. But "War, Inc" is also a film by the Hamrnstar, a consensus that you either believe or not. If you want to be entertained, go see it. If not, fork over your money and find something else.

nights ago on PBS. Why in the world would I deny myself the pleasure of watching a winter episodes of “Downton Abbey”? Part of the joy of being retired is the freedom to make your own schedule, but here I was dithering. Know yourself. I know I like to talk about TV – it’s my guilty pleasure. I know I like to share about my favorite series when a friend asks. Just as I enjoyed commenting about a film adaptation of my all-time favorite Thomas Hardy novel, The Woodlanders and my interest re-reading the novel to compare thoughts.  There will be plenty of time for movies, novels, and TV sitting in iced-over Minneapolis, but for now I am in springtime Florida. I will watch more “Downton Abbey” on VIASAT, if we find it. (What is Denmark’s favorite TV show? I have been looking for it.) I have posted on “Downton Abbey” a couple of times in the past, including in my blog entry on Cosplay: costume-role playing. In addition a reader left a comment about “Downton Abbey” serial killers, and another mentioned I could write fan fiction. This time I’m going to delve a bit about the characters and characterizations rather than continuity. (Years of teaching preaching skills must have permeated my brain
paint drying to form a tortuous, cruel-torture, masochistic simile-meaning while someone switched a razor-sharp guitar drone back and forth'. Hell, I'm writing this cringe-worthy review in an attempt to come up with new metaphor/simile usages that are not reflected in this film's end credits...I'm having a blast...I hope the 'anal/retentive/idiotic' review of Metabolism makes it onto the Usenet to round out the original film's cult status! I despair sometimes at the present level of artistic standards. Hey, filmmakers...you cannot make a 'static' film sound beautiful...the most you can achieve is a beat-strike, punk non-tempoicked sound oozing left and right leaving the viewer with a blinding white screen and a shuddering back passage! Metabolism sounds even more atrocious than June andender or even the Trans-X V/Q Synthesizer 12" lp. This is certainly not beat music, though people who wanted this type of dross should be pleased. "stare upwards...wake me when grey and grey are apparente...Zzzzz...." a certain jazz musician said recently about a one-note skank. Do not buy Flipper-Negatron on Film until you have listened to enough industrial guitar/syn
A miniseries. A multi-year series. A soap opera. A reality show. FOX is interested in a reality show. Why not just give us it all? Supporting cast doing the ancillary story lines is the kind of TV that used to pop up from time to time. (Small wonder that this character deserves his own series, according to an article last week.) More, please.The reviews are almost as gruesome as the murders. Series professors have assigned essays on the subject. Tough assignments, I figured one essay was set to explore the body parts motif. See how gruesome these articles are? In these days of OJ Dyamond, (harder to get into the acute angle, than the obtuse one) the stay at home mothers seem to slip down the dugouts like Starbucks Grand context of the dual plotlines: Edward into the vortex we like to call the Internet.Epsom Salt Makes it kinda hard to find things out on Twitter, Tinder likes to tell us what’s going on and I guess that’s the mood for the market.

type since the office.  it is different it is more uh angry than the office.  it feels sometimes that it so many ways is like the uk version two of peep show (athough not in the direction writing style it is in the similarities in the characters and the social gramma joke style ones like deangram but even they get real too) but i can say that the humour is absent of guilttasm (i founds this is one of the main things that put me off about peep show) and the portrayal of the characters is genuinley hilarious and i care for them despite quite a few of the characters almost being horrible human beings in some ways.  it is also set in almost present day (decent smoko next door but for an abg to catch up with the office 21st century it should be beautiful and spacious and may i be very original in the sense of having watched unbreakable please do not sit on the stairs) which can enchance my interest in the show.  i am njoying this more than the office simply bec i have not seen it used in it yet in the sense of the prime laugh at the dense beurocracies that are there.  I can say i well and truly propse a toast to the show for making me laugh and the critics were right on it yet again. five star unst and stiched up by the Police.
something as had seen many of the scenes in the rest of the movie. I have always wanted to see the portions of the movie that I missed.. I looked up the DVD for sale but I noticed the price was high so decided to do a search on YouTube for download. I found it and downloaded it before they removed it. What I saw I have been waiting for so long. I am now starting my search for the original movie without all of the corny effects in order to see the birth of everything. I highly recommend watching this movie, even if you are young. It is a nice science fiction movie. If you found this movie after me I suggest you start your search too. However, if you can purchase the If you can find the actual movie or anything closer to the beginning of the movie download it… you have not lived… or well I recommend watching it. On another note I find this story kind of interesting because Stephen Hawking believes that the universe did not have a beginning. so he calls himself an atheist… Let just see what this movie reveals.. as to the truth about the real universe. where did the universe came from.. on another hand they tell us something else about Einstein theory of relativity, the “E” is for energy.. what they do not tell you is the history behind this theory. E=Energy+mass. Mass is another name for gravity, so in a way the theory of relativity is saying that the speed of
it lol. It is just fun to try and trick them all trying to get them to laugh, when it to hard to understand. They just love it when someone spells osom instead of awesome. They get all smart their faces and realize they spelled it wrong and it turns out to be that all your friends calling you names and then you get a little miffed and say "thattsuoi", and then laugh. and Oh and my very favorite is, "my name is ____ and I am leaving Cake-hit", just regardless of who is there and who you are. They will get it all wrong because it is so simple they don't understand.

favorite Kung-Fu Hustle / Shaolin Soccer action comedies that I've seen. It has most of the common tropes that are prevalent in this type of flick - infinity fight scenes, final Chan-like training montage, religious themes as well as groups of 'bad' guys- try to take down the ultimate 'good' guy all in the name of their cult/organization and the secrets they possess. All packed into one incredibly funny flick. The leads were a good choice for the comedy/action roles. Fun flicks to watch and has some heavy laughs.  Like the other reviews say, the action scenes are fluid, and there is plenty of comedy here. The beginning fight scene is a stand out, with a music track playing that fits perfectly, and pairs well with the action, plus eerie soundtrack highlights that just add to the somber nature of the fight. And the scene keeps up with the mof...  Really action-packed movie, with the good vs evil story line. Don't see much of this type of film these days, so really enjoy this more traditional form of Kung Fu. Highly worth the watch.

romance, and wisdom. I was impressed by how perfectly the overall plot of the story worked with the theme. "The Heart-Breakers can't break good," indeed. They certainly possess the skills to break people's hearts, but it is the other thing: their love for their work. We could see that Nicholson's love for acting is deeper than Nicolson's love for acting, even if it is more transparent. In fact, it is more natural and less pretentious. It is all about emotional exchange and emotional connection. It is there that we can really see why one heart breakers can't break good. It is impossible for an emotionally ugly person to actually love other people. The sticky part is that many people like the feeling of being emotionally harmed. They like the scent of the person that has had an emotional connection with them. It is not about physical appearance but about emotional connection. The Heart-Breakers have that emotional connection and their disguise is their sexiness. They are not sexy at all. They have learned to use sex as a tool to get what they want. And that is the real secret behind their success. They act as if they are in love, and that is the real trick because if you have sex out of love, it never fails. Their sexiness is just a mask with no intention of ever breaking someone's heart. As they say: "We do this for fun and we do
if they were a little bit scary for my kid brain. In retrospect, they were probably a little too scary to watch as a child, but what do I know? I still watch them as an adult and I still find some of them terrifying, but I enjoy them anyway. Here are some horror films that scared me when I was younger, and still terrify me now. Maybe I should never watch another horror film again, but I can't help it! If you're a horror movie lover, you will understand what I mean. Fair warning: This article may contain small spoilers, but nothing too huge. Everyone should watch a horror movie once in a while. It's just part of the film experience! We'll get through hard times, just like the characters in these movies do. Also, you should watch these horror movies while you still can because some of them have now been removed completely from Netflix. Here are eight horror movies that scared me in childhood, and still scare me today. Here are eight horror films that scared me in childhood, and still scare me today.

the whole thing. First of all the effects are terrible and that isn't saying much considering this is a zombie movie. The acting and storylines consisted of a terrible little kid, some bad acting pirates, fake native turtle and white umbrellas. There are a lot of unnecessary still shots of the docks when there is no action just bad wind blowing shit all over the place. This film was very annoying and after one viewing I will not touching it again. If you are listening to this and still want to see it you are crazy! Bring it on! I am ready to watch your nightmares come true on my tv. Good luck! Give 'me your best shot!/Late. Peace out! See telling people they are the cause of their own bad fortune seems to instill good feelings in me so I am going to tell this four leaf waitress at Kelsey's that no one likes her wait on the food is impossible and she should surround herself with people who feel the same way about her as I do. I'll bet Vance and Scott hear all about this in the next few days! Killer Cheese about you should listen to this film. It is so awful I think you'll enjoy it on some morbid level. Good night! Podcasting live from beautiful Connecticut. Warning may contain traces of nuts. Vandy! In thirty minutes I will be watching a terrible movie without her.
here. This movie, based off a popular children’s toy, is the product of Richard Gere and Sophia Loren, two real life partners. Horribly cute – but what should be awfully hard-to-swallow kitsch rather suddenly turns into uber, overly-kitsch, seemingly against their being, and emits one of the ugliest screen sunsets to-date since the Arizona desert. Lawrence Welk somehow figured prominently into the finished-product, despite poor departure. The premise is safe, but pummeling and the dialogue falls off. After costarring in the original film in 1997, Ed Hirsch holds the Todd close (Sigourney Weaver) – but isn’t terribly convincing. Both teddy-bears Todd beside ancillary adults come to life and that should bring comfort, yet the result of this forced-matchup exceedingly replies cringe-worthiness, offering little jouissance in teddy manner. In constant conjugation, now 76-year-old Gere and 75-year-old Loren look embarrassing; yet, performing as their adult counterparts, the pretend foreplay and lack thereof provide enough comedic dissonance to put a check in the hilarity column despite it being way over-the-top unpalatable. All in all, as cute it is (and it is cute),
boring video. You have my condolences if you ever see it. As you may have noticed it has a fade in so it fades from the TroC2 vid. I only did that because it was done by Corey Healy and he might kill me if I removed it. I did add a fade out since I thought it helped after the credits. Now I'm crying. Tell me to shut up. So yeah it's an homage to Mtallica and their St. Anger album and I tried to over analyze why it fux. Metallicc is no24 and they are no2 they are guys that put swear words in the title instead of things like van halen, Van romeo dotic and troamette bay crappa. Metallicss were not even around in 1986 and did not know what they where doing. I also decided to make the length 16 when the intro sucked and I decided it didn't need to show the intro at all. To Healy faders you at around 5:86 when it fades to blank. It's better that way. The video fades out and ends I hope and fade post credit. That's it. Oh with the exception of tons of extra edit s I snipped out. I also did the credits in Corey s edit s but they don t scroll like his except that he chose better color s
employers and spotted a beloved friend in the former babysitter's future. Gina's life is like some living social experiment - 'If you change your behavior will the public respond positively?' The same is true of her divorce in a long-term marriage - 'IF they know everything perhaps they will be more accepting because they know he's a cad.' However none of the characters are blameless for the sadness that comes into their lives. They choose whom to love and how to live life. This is a remarkable ride with delightful twists and fun characters. It's a sad story but it's still not tragic. Check it out for yourself...LOTS of interesting moments, conflicts and resolutions. Nice acting by Blythe Danner, Kristen Davis, Laura Linney, Cheryl Hines, Susan Sarandon and a host of others. This kind of independent film is very close to my heart. My rating: ***** 5 stars.

sex and drug culture of the 1970s in the fearless PUTNEY SWOPE (1969), which became one of America's favorite cult classics. Almost two decades later he followed with another masterpiece, CHAFED ELBOWS (1991). The comedy, which won the Audience Award for Best Feature at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival, offered an insider's account of the Downey clan. This 1994 interview by Craig Watson was conducted soon after the revelation that Downey's son, actor Robert Downey, Jr., had been arrested for narcotics possession. On the eve of Chafed Elbows' debut on DVD, this article finds new relevance as Downey, Jr., approaches release date for IRON MAN 3 with Marvel Comics. —Editor.

with Robert Redford's understated charm (he's so cute in his Swedish bachelor driver outfit! I would go for that any day!) The only reason why it loses a star for me, is because of a few things: In the end, from Lucinda's point of view, Sean's parting words about how much he regretted for not being a better husband made me all: "wait, what!?" He implies to his daughter that he is not going to divorce his wife (which obviously means that she cannot be with him) because her mother would be hurt, but ostensibly he cannot see that other people in his entourage, such as his former wife and his older daughter, would also be hurt (since he would be marrying another woman completely) When Sean shouts at Lucinda that he doesn't need her to make her ass a size 4 and look like a model, and she walks away angrily...that made me SO upset. Especially because he does so whilst kissing her foot! That scene made it seem like he was legitimately implying that he does not see Lucinda as someone worthy of his love because she cannot fit a kind of societal model of a perfect woman, and that essentially she's not good enough for him, she's an accident he does not have to deserve, and perhaps that's why he feels no need to divorce his wife...because he
would share my own opinion about this movie with you here: almost all the critics dissed this movie, calling it incoherent and pointless... but I don't believe it was so. I think it was very symbolic, using the incapability or incapacity of a person to express his ideas and concepts to represent the moment of the Italian nation life that Nanni Moretti had decided to put the spotlights on. However it touched some topics of our society nowadays: I am Italian as well, and I found myself in both Titta and the general public in the theatre in the moment when he realized the body of the politicians and, finally, the purely good actor, was "alien", foreign to him. An Italy where the "mask" is wearing, where the politicians borrow each other's faces to appear less bad in the eyes of common people... an Italy that has lost its identity. Those are exactly the aspects that influenced my feelings during the film. I appreciate N.Moretti's ability to transfer the "anger" coming from the Italians in too many aspects on screen in a very Italian way: sarcastic. I didn't see it as an existential crisis of the actor, or of the artist as Titta himself said, but rather as a breaking point, a break in the barrier, a crisis of a revolution in his mind. The movie may seem a bit "strange" but I think you may appreciate it anyway
I just finished seeing it and struggled to watch it all the way through. I had to pause every few minutes to see if I should turn it off, but gradually powered through it. It might honestly have another title that sounds slightly familiar and will perhaps prevent some other poor souls from going to see it. It's shameful really, that you can get a film like this into a distribution. The acting is beyond awful that it's actually sickening to watch. I'm pretty sure this wasn't even real - it could have been performed by cruise ship comedians on any average weekend. The only thing worse than the skit it's trying to convey is the fact that it could have romanticized an already out there relationship. The actors in this should immediately get expelled from the acting community. Seriously. This was one of those things that was so bad, you can see immediately how it's perhaps even PG-13. It is an unfortunate film. Oh and...thankfully I didn't have to hear a laugh track as I did the screening. That is nothing short of a miracle!!! So, do you go with no or yes stars rated? I'm going with one star because a man holding his children leads to intrigue. And yes, that makes complete sense. Yes stars, but one star, according to Archetype subscribers You HAVE to watch this film and tell me your response. And I won't
Stamp, a rich, old, retired businessman, has just finished reading Goethe's Faust. He stumbles upon a young man walking with a girl at dusk on a Belgravia street near Stratford Gardens. Unable to imagine what a girl in the 19th century could be, he offers them a lift home in his well-worn, bright red, late-model, American, chauffeur-driven car. Jean and her boyfriend accept. Outside 11 Brook Street, just as Sir Aubrey is about to drop them off, the young man who is a composer and a mentor to Jean thanks Sir Aubrey for his courtesy and the lift. He gives him a recording of a new popular song, written by Candida Clay, with the working title 'Fine', calling himself Finny. Jean tells him it is beautiful. As they walk slowly away just a little way, she falls over and Finny stops to help her. Assuming she has fainted, Aubrey rushes to Jean who awakens and is now unsure what has happened. Sir Aubrey calls Finny a dandy, a cad and an opportunist who's only into Jean for her 'sex'. Aubrey takes Jean home to 11 Brook Street, Sydney St, Stratford Gardens, demanding that Jean tells him her parents, telling him she's staying there. As he leaves, Fin
rate it as high as I do, especially since I’ve only watched it a total of three times. The performances by everyone from Johnny Lee Miller and Liv Tyler to Ian Hart and Alan Rickman are spot on, the historical aspects seem fairly accurate, the costumes well-done, and the sets suitably realistic. The action is intense and exciting while Rachel Portman’s score compliments it so well. Together they create a wonderfully stylised world for it’s mostly comedic time, the battlefield scenes used to bring up humor being just one example. There’s really nothing I can say bad about it and I suppose that’s the highest praise one can give to it. From the very first moment to the last Plunkett & Macleane delights and I’m certainly glad there was never a second one to dampen it’s shine. Don’t miss it. 10/10- Full Satisfaction!

sick one day, I had come home from school early and my mom was making me soup. This movie helped mend a lonely soul that’s what it did, forever a wonderful movie if you’re watching it when you’re down. I remember skimming through the paper trying to find something to watch and this guy’s face just stopped me and I said “wow”, and finally finding the movie playing at the right time I decided to give it a try. The movie had no face, no smiles, no colors, it completely changed me; I was, am and always will be a fan of black and white movies it’s just so inspirational for me, the style itself, the black and white, everything. That’s why I will forever love Tim Burton. Since then, I’ve seen this over and over again, and don’t get me wrong, I still like it, but watching a guy jump down an elevator shaft three times in a row is kinda redundant. I’ll never ever forget this movie. It’s one of my favorite movies of all time. Now there is a 30 min version which I probably won’t watch, they’re always crappy… But if it’s not then it has my definite stamp of approval. So check this one out, sorry if it’s not for you, it is what it is; a movie of wonderful appearances, unexplain
, how did this movie take three years?? I also remember ONE scene in this movie VERY CLEARLY: Peter Gabriel’s retarded and stupid Looking for Europe band …but we’ll get to that in a moment. Overall, I figured I’d go with the hubby for old times sake (sleeping). Bad. Idea. #1. The only thing in this movie worth anything is the chemistry between Julie Christie (the old lady) and Judi Dench (the new lady). #2 If you want to see that one scene with Peter Gabriel, just watch the video on YouTube …it says THIS WHOLE MOVIE IS OUT THERE! How can you put OUT A MOVIE THIS IS OUT THERE …or is that a joke? It can’t be …you can’t tell that joke on today’s screen. Movie is forgettable and overdone. If you haven’t seen it, shrug it up as inciting dialogue for Hollywood remakes coming up in 20 year’s time-assuming you’re in a old people’s home and have nothing else to do (tho at that point, how will they decide who gets to watch that Julia Cruise/Jack Nicolson/Sir Peter Gabriel SHIT? Nursing homes are conducive …JUST SAYIN’). DON’T WASTE 3 YEARS OF YOUR DAM
what a surprise I was going to get and actually liked the new Wicker Man. Truth be told, it was at least as scary as the original and edgy too. Nicolas Cage played part Lionel from Pittsburgh with bizarre emotions. This film was "R" not "X" rated though and I liked the more psychological thriller feel to the remake. The "Green was not so Green" did not make my barf happy though and this may be a cause of my mild barf feeling, but it was more the first kiss was with the bee hairs, no thank you, and then when he kissed her again, damn, could he get a good kiss in? He felt like he was kissing pure poison from the hairs on her lips! OK, so one has to remember that this bee thing did not explain the "Own Nothing" chant that I heard. Anyhow, 7 out of 10 pretty good movie, but 8 out of 10 for cool music score throughout the film. So just to help This Wicker Man flick, if it was XXX rated, it could then bring out the real excitement of the original and would therefore get an Ahh style eight out of ten from me, but, since I am a hard to please uplifter, I will not be persuaded into a cheap barf rating. A quick note though, be prepared for lots of Hokey Pokey and skipping
on the poster at least, and we're not going to argue with somebody who designed her own poster--among a hundred other things. In reality, Visconti was just one of many directors who began using soundstages, minimal sets and untrained actors to give their films a more gritty and authentic look and feel, an approach on full display here--its stars being completly wiped out by the film credits at the end--though one that also basks in a luridly erotic tone. Stealing Gino whenever we could keep our eyes open, this was in many ways just as modern as what Scorsese and Tarantino had been doing over in the States, though just as we remain perplexed about what would possess anybody to do such a thing either. Watching what appears to be very early inspiration for the German Expressionism of Fritz Lang and G.W. Pabst, D. Harlan Wilson could only muster an expression of blank disbelief when asked how he felt about watching it. A film that is far more histrionic and hysterical than you would ever have imagined, we can only counter with an indignant, Quién diable pudiera dispreciarla? <p>   <i><b>Director:</b> Luchino Visconti</i>   <i><b>Stars:</b
. Then I failed to watch it but that didn't stop me from judging the book by the cover, if you like. It looked very old fashioned and twee which normally bothers me. The front cover image also looks like it could be an old painting - gone digital - and, given the book club theme in the background, I suspect they're being a bit cute with the anachronism. Alert the mod squad. Still, if you don't like dresses with realistic prints, you can watch the jealous whippets in the background going bark mad. Try to stay calm. Actually, now that I've linked to the book on Amazon there's a huge amount of taster quotes and reviews. Suspect I may have under-egged the pudding. Amelia Quirk -- the heroine -- is presented as a manipulative, thorny individual. Maybe the cover's dappled gaze flows from the main action in the novel. The book's published by Century, home of Ian McEwan. Time-hop to that war audiobook, if you've not read any... Though it looks like this sibling interest needs unravelling a bit further. Reckon a Kiwi review of it's due online this summer. PS: Before I took this rasher click I fancied cheeky tidy-up. Maybe that's also a trait drivers weave
ever seen. The D-Day scene is most definitely one of the most emotional and epic parts of the film, and the leading characters such as Captain Miller (Tom Hanks' character) were all brilliantly portrayed by the actors. The film leaves you with different emotions, as if you've just been in that film, which is a great effect. If you really love amazing films, I highly recommend this film. It's not for kids, and they will not appreciate this film anyway. Rating: A+ wins hearts and minds over. "Because we are Americans! We're mavericks and top guns! We're bigger than the Corleone family! We can kick ass all by ourselves!" 129/100 This is not on IMDB for what reason is beyond me. As of 4-1-2017, there are currently 32 votes here. This movie is a classic for my generation. Most popular war films are about winning. This isn't. There's an unsettling defeat about it and maybe that's why it's not more legendary than it should be. But it's visually gorgeous and the performances beautifully understated. And the ending is a stunner... in more ways than one. Another aspect I haven't seen mentioned is the camera angles and shots, particularly after the paratroopers land. It's creative and gives this film
a good trailer and I thought I would share. It seems like a typical Korean film, but Chris Palmer over at Koreanfilm.org says it’s different from all of the Confucianist melodrams. My guess is it’s closer to Kim Jee-woon’s A Bittersweet Life than your typical Korean kitchen sink drama. It’s got suspense and suspense, when it all falls apart. In a way, it reminds me of Nicolas Cage’s Leaving. Like most of the films recommended by Kinch on Kvideo, the trailer and concept seem funny. I may wait to see this on the plane to Korea, but then again, this is Kristen Scott-Thomas! Do we really need a clear concept or skin-deep emotions to enjoy a good movie? Say it ain’t so! I like the movie as is since it is great example of a director staying close to the source. No fake feelings or generous time-spent to build up tension, just cheap and quality English production that sells tickets. Kristen Scott-Thomas as a Korean national? It doesn’t seem to far-fetched, no? Check out the essay on JKS in GQ. For me, it’s the umpteenth time he is referred to as a ‘heartthrob’. He has certainly gotten famous fast. But as they say, God was smiling on him when he j
indeed a great shame that it has been neglected so long. The fact that Kelly is black, seems so basic to me. Nevertheless, this can barely be compared with modern stage adaptations of historical works, such as District Six and The Wiz, because Kelly already gets to call the shots. The tempo of the individual dance numbers is perfect, the film images have aged very well and one gets the impression that everything was carefully thought through. This musical clearly set a standard in its time. It is one of the best musical films that I know. There is really no reason why it should not be more widely known. The basic story is very sappy and simple, by modern standards. So how does a man without ambition become the CEO of a large company? By marrying a woman who would like to, so it’s based on a big lie. The man who is not very successful is changed by his wife. This is followed by an affair with an elegant woman who acts because she wants to be (so to speak). Here on a scale in the blu-ray . Excellent picture quality, good extras. The image quality is very good for the time.

the interviewed citizens are about nature but then flashbacks to the bombing raids are shown. There is only one photo after a short while showing the destruction, the other are photos of nature (some of which remind of the scene in "Rabbit's Chances" after I painted that woods a red-hot grey). There are helicopter videos from 1979 and 1984 but  only between 10-20 seconds and then the other 10 minutes and 30 seconds are shown after 2008!!! The entire footage!!! The background photos show summer as my memories of Nuremberg are of summer (or autumn) time. But trees don't look like that in autumn. They are bare branches, twigs. No leaves at all.

He has no money and knows there will be no cure , he only wants to keep the company and the research going , but as it goes on in the movie it all comes out and reveals his true psychotic son of satantrys behind his experiments , exploiting the subjects and only performing the experiments for himself.

life etc. But unfortunately it fails to deliver the "message" in such a weak way that its hard to exactly pin it down.It keeps jumping from subject to subject for entire running time so that only the venerable Frances McDormand remains constant. The preacher could care less about his flock,the wife could care less about her family and son,the FBI gal not interested in the case,the friend-driver does nothing. McDormand help one young african american woman make her life better but thats all we get to see of this movie. Even if this can be considered a slice of life type of film it remains a slice that cuts at the wrong places of the table so not much to take in. 2/10 bis.

long film, at around three hours. Very long. It could do with a good edit, and the length sort of kills any tension that there might have been in this twisty thriller. However there is an interesting premise involving the US' response to the beheading of the war photographer James Foley. Foley is an actual person, this film is not an accurate representation of anything that might have happened in real life, just a kind of fantastical version of events as fact versus imagination. In this case the worldwide anger, and outrage, at seeing the horrific decapitation. This fictionalisation could have happened in place of anything, it's the usual 'England and American cultures' one and done. The rest are familiar tropes like the tetchy new leader, and the land man. The wife and mother of the war photographer who chooses to make contact with his captors, in an attempt to get him to hold yellow cards with AmericanNews in the middle so everyone will know he's state TV, and not ISIS. This is a long film with a cast and very familiar names. This film didn't quite 'do it' for me. Yes the story was good, for a while, and it's not overlong in terms of running time, but it does outstay it's welcome, it outlines what could have been a lot shorter. All in all, not bad. .DT
and scams and deception ultimately lead to Mac and Janet’s wedding. But that setup doesn’t give you a clue that what unfolds in the next hour and a half is a send-up of several genres taking on a wide cross section of the madness in American society at this time. (I feel the urge to repeat, at the beginning of each paragraph, how mind-bendingly amazing this movie is — because, wow, this movie is amazing.) “Stay Hungry” is a story about America, this country, for good and for the most part, badly bad. That darkness, yes, that is very unnerving in its own right. Is it satire or parody, or just honest rants from the heart? The protagonist is unreliable. The antagonist is lovable. But that’s the strength of Portis’s writing — he paints with all colors. A rich palette. Finally, the ending is unexpected but it is also fulfilling. The themes of frustrated ambition and heartbreak with their hope and despair, Peckinpah’s masterful visual depictions, the cast (every single character, in its own down-trodden way) is dazzling. It reads now like the vision of the end of the golden dream of America, the burning towers, trying to grab a life in all ways flavors of opportunity, never
terrific Danish comedy-drama from film-maker Ole Christian Madsen with the interesting title: ‘Transmitter and Receiver’ … which, for some reason, the film distributor chose to slap the English title ‘In Your Hands’ on! Perhaps they wanted a stupidly obvious title, and perhaps this flavour of the film is not the most competent one, if this French-looking-title gets changed to something dumb! Or perhaps the distributor have many other films to release and its best to make a presumption and print a boring signpost indicating this film’s spot in the multitude of releases? – I get it, that’s also a stretch, going for a ‘sign posting’ approach. Buy stickers that affix a moustache on your bonnet, and simply go for a ‘normally human-cat’ if they’re to cut corners – or perhaps use that obnoxious small-dog emoji to signal cat on a telephone app??! The inhumanity of it all will tire an amateur’s patience – indeed – all who have any interest at all in cuteness. Just as anyone who has ears, a face, or an appealing ‘discomfort controversy appreciation’ for watching ‘idiosyncratic’ people being viewed on screen. My patience has run thin on my brittle, anal, cat-article tolerance: all be it the reasons are simple: I have thorough
. With the proven virtues of the James Bond films, production manager Albert R. Broccoli took on the project. And his co-producers were acclimated to and comfortable with horror films: writer Richard Maibaum also wrote the screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock’s Frenzy and own uproars such as the From Russia with Love and Thunderball novels, which he adapted for Cubby Broccoli-produced films. For a foray into the dark world of James Bond, The Man with the Golden Gun was crafted. Make sure to check out light reviews. The fact that it lacks a lot of attention and the notion that it is one of the least favorite Bond films ever is particularly unwarranted, given what The Man with the Golden Gun really offers: an engaging film. The non-verbal witty humor that is such an integral part of the stories of Fleming Hagandal and Le Carré continues. Bond goes to Thailand on assignment, slips into various high-class hotels, and is accompanied by a circus of endemic extravagances on his way from Phuket to Bangkok; it jerk.

to a character’s corpse up close, only inches from the viewer’s face. As if we are somehow being groomed and sculpted by director Alejandro Jodorowsky (who himself has passed away) before this tale of a family is revealed. I’m struck by a quote somewhere about films being born within the first five minutes and I feel that this is indeed the case here with PTU. The title is from a card game that is incredibly popular in Hong Kong and cannot be translated directly to another language. Yet, the main, male protagonists of this tale, like many iconoclastic heroes, change into card players multiple times during the course of the film. Why is this so? Why is their card game life, when they are not wearing that disappointing imitation tuxedo look like they wear so often for their job, with the cardboard medal of a policeman hanging heavily from their necks, preferable? A constant search to escape the doldrums of the everyday for a position of burgeoning fortitude. With that bond of formation behind the man, the wrestling, wringing the truth, the struggle of manhood. A never-ending song sung for centuries, generations, the trap of earthly existence, the limits of our mortal reality now come under scrutiny in PTU. We struggle to break free from data collectors and data stalkers and the ever-present toad

The embattled politician then attempts to drown himself — leaving the second key amid the debris as she coughs up green goo. You can easily change and tell if its negative or positive. She reaches into the water to grab the key as she fights to stay alive, clutching it as a representation of hope. Woman’s attempt to commit suicide but she reaches out to grab the key. I agree that it’s not the most exciting song, but the visual is intriguing and the colors are beautiful. As she lies there, the Congress president’s message in various languages (projecting your thoughts or motivations) comes up against a backdrop of various degrees of green Goo. Hero Kumar is wearing a white Kanda Vastra that is part of a trend in Indian cinema today — usually worn by the true good guy in our films, adding to Kumar’s kudos in this role. Through a musical montage, we see Congress leaders against a backdrop of green goo, as they state China’s political will to support North Korea, and try to

the band creating a sound so now, so pure and so intoxicating that listeners still try to make sense of the band after a half century after their break up. Even director Ron Howard was concerned with trying to make a documentary as apposing of “making facts” from memories and saying “it’s just not that kind of movie.”  Though Howard to his credit doesn’t treat Yesterday’s English Breakfast as an attempt to  make hundreds of new Beatles fans, but serves as an examination of how the music of these four Liverpool lads impacted the lives of his friends as teenagers, in the style of the talking head documentary with long time music journalist Steve Turner, as a prelude to the main event the interview Howard had with McCartney and Starr’s explained. Turner and other contributors like Charles Shaar Murry and George Martin discus the impact the band music having, on the conversation of race and civil rights, how they integrated harmonies since World War II have made a new American rock sound since the British Invasion. Howard’s attempt to humanize the two remains a classy one, as he see the two men as not God like figures, but equals in everyone else here as a pair of aged musicians who twenty years after they split up that people still want to engaged with the music. When the film has lengthy discussions of Martin’s role in creating unique sound and Starr’s initial drumming style,

I am not exactly sure what detracted from it but it certainly had the makings to be a sleeper but it ended up becoming a Drowser ( a movie that has a very interesting premise that ends up never achieving its goal due to lack of vision or script errors, such as Syriana or A Mighty Heart, two great examples) . Mad at the world, Mac McKendrick was once the most savage columnist and cringe-inducing TV-animal, but achieved this by unfair use of the obvious stiffing and threating his controversial, he’s now about to be indicted over damaging-fantasy-allegations-of-sexual-influence that he allegedly collected from his fellow executive and former lovers by a destructive prestigious figure in search for information at aspiration – Chief Editor Ed Jaynes.

or- 15 years ago, this film should bring back lots of memories. It's a genuine, down to earth and realistic film. Unlike the NY4LC film (Donnachie and Slipcue's film) which is more cheesy, unsure and dumbed-downed for 'the public' this film is about the UK fashion-fuelled street punk movement and the discovery that a lot of kids coming at it in a more relaxed manner. The clash between those who had been around a while exuding more 'authenticity' and anarchy culture and those new to the street punk scene trying to have some fun with it was very real; and made for an interesting few years of development, change and growth. So, we did grow-up, we moved on and moved forward. From SXPP to places (and outfits) a fair bit more luxurious, modern and complicated....not surprising - that's what it does - everything becomes mainstream and loses its' rawness. There's no going back. Everyone I know from punk and street punk either stopped doing it or just grew-up and got on with being working class; those who are still at it are a bit stuck like a deer caught-in-the-head-lights and watch their peers moving on without them. Watch this film and you get caught in-between and will understand better. Remember Kids All Over The Place
forgive that is so, but they had the lead characters speak with an English accents, yet you here words that just don't fit the accent. The movie is supposedly a Disney production, yet there are vulgar situations and behaviours throughout the movie. It seems that Disney started pre-judging the viewing audience, as if they think all kids should be old enough to deal with such behaviour. I don't think so. Disney, I am proud of you otherwise, but you are getting it wrong on this one. No need to include bad behavioural examples. They are out there, we all know that anyways. The other thing I am wondering about is why they are characterizing the monks as "beings of magic"? Magic is not right for monks, chanting and worship of their God is. I don't get it. I think this movie would have been better even as a serious movie! Kids need to see what the world is like, not get sugarcoated ideas about it. Even Little Z can hang the sides of his mouth in disapproval with this one! Now, I will assume it might be better than I have said, and I will take my toddler to see it to make myself sure, but I think I know I will be disappointed despite his agreement to come along. I will let you know, but I will leave this review up anyhow. People need to make their own ideas! So, Read
character based approach does slow the pacing, and may leave viewers wondering if this really RAIMING Tony Montage's famous Ultimate Fighting Angels buster. Nice item of classic Lone Star production, in which producer Larry Levinson seems still to be feeling his way. In the first show he unveils his trendy open-set, chroma-keyed underground holding-cell. Many of the actors have gone on to other series, including Levinson's NAKED CITY, though Channing Ward may be the pick of the litter. Gays insinuate themselves in civil supportive roles. Your Big Brother is William Conrad. Interesting to observe Lone Star's cold-water musical style: romping drunken hootenannies on a'squared" Manhattan street piano, passages of city street noise heightened by volume, distorted, and suddenly given electronic embellishments. Also in your rolodex: Jonathan Harris and the theme from DC CORNMEAL DENTISTORONTO (B+). Its such a cozy romp that one feels its a Dev Ison show just waiting to be made. Money: Although he does not accept help from the Martians, Adam has many monetary conflicts, even after his marriage to Lindsay.

The Ring (Gore Verbinski, 2002) thrown in for good measure. They really need to come up with a new storyline. Adds a clever ending, at least. Danish apocalyptic horror film, continuing the trend of popular Asian horror in North America (the first wave being The Grudge (Takashi Shimizu, 2004), The Grudge 2 (Takashi Shimizu, 2006), Pulse (Kiyoshi Kurosawa, 2006)). The car journey with Jasper and the zombies is terrific. Not enough scenes with zombie cheerleader. Soundtrack borrowed from The Ring, too. Really would have liked to have seen more of the eerie black-haired twins. Another example of a mediocre copy trying to imitate something original and sublime. Highlighted in Suicide Girls Vol. 1 (Rhett Green, 2004). Ruby's television comment on her dead father is jaw-dropping. Otto's insistence in not burying his ex-wife's body in the first place gives cause for argument, as does his dismissal of his ex-wife's mental state. But what really stands out is their initial course of action when they are adamant that they're 'not running'
as worthless as some would have you think. It's a pretty solid slasher. I enjoyed it, even though it's really not very good. Though the movie is undeniably dumb, it's still has its fun moments. It's not a massive gamble, there's no blatant art direction other than some effects, but it does have the look of a low budget horror movie from the 90s. This is a pretty tidy slasher movie. There's some funny dialogue, and some good visuals. Again, it's not uncanny in any way, but it's not awful. There are some really good scenes, like the guy on the toilet, and the scene with the girl on the motorcycle. There scenes are pretty misogynistic, but that's what the movie is about, so that's okay. I don't think there's anything particularly offensive about the whole thing. I enjoyed it. But this is one of those movies that doesn't really have anything going on. You don't really know what's going on. It's a mystery, and it's a mystery that you don't have to try very hard to figure out. It's just there. I don't think that's a bad thing. This is a slasher movie that doesn't require you to put any thought into it.
I’ve absolutely adored many of their films, especially Three Men in a Boat from the late 1930s. George Robey is delightful to watch, doing the rounds of the British comedy stars I’ve already gotten to know. He, Leslie Fuller, and Tommy Trinder are tourists who rent a boat at Paddington Station to go down the Thames… somehow, they end up boat-hopping, doing a variety show with the Captain and the crew, drinking lots of gin at their destination, etc. Very funny. Lovely to rent (Mariachi!) also with the star quartet. (It’s the first of their films; the second is Remember? which is almost as funny.) They get there in the end. Connors’ film was also funny, and the Cockney twins seem to have perfected the “inhabited sore tooth” bit. It sounds kind of gross if you’ve never seen it! Connors story (in a small Irish town with hapless Constables) is hilarious. The Dutch cheerleaders in rehearsal were hilarious too. What a fun film to watch. William Bendix is in this one. I look forward to watching Three Men in a Boat extra-especially now … the Crazy Gang deserves to be famous. It’s a shame that none of their songs became standards the way some of the Hollywood
coming and keep on changing. I’m finally coming around though. After watching the boring modern version of Dickens with Jim Carrey, I need something real. By real, I mean no historical inaccuracies. My version of a good Christmas Carol has to have the Dickens flavor. I was starting to think I had watched Charleston Heston’s version,  but then I woke up and realized it was not historical. A sign from God for sure… I can’t believe we’ve gone this far without a good Christmas Carol movie. Now, anything less than Masterpiece casting is going to be trash. Combining Masterpiece Theater actors and ghost’s never shown in the Dickens version is how to do it. I had high hopes though, because Gary Oldman in a movie is always good. Missing from the cast was Liam Neeson though. It was more of a movie traveling production than anything else. Rest of the cast looked more like television has than a movie. They made a bold choice with the director. The Graver’s Playbook. Oh boy. It was not a bad performance by Charles Dickens (Lawrence Gillardki Jr.), but it was not quite what I was hoping for. They played him like a scoundrel in a George R.R. Martin novel. That was Dawson’s Creek. Dickens moped around the whole time, Gerard Butler as Scrooge didn’t

and his brothers Sean and Daniel, they are also the three robbers that made the eastern part looking back at the Little Rock police station, and their favorite people, their families. They came from a past of a fairly poor life, a single mother of James was still in prison this time. They grew up in a world where nobody cares about human, where what is done is cheated brutally, where it is easier to strive for your goals with scissors and a knife in your hands than without them. The success they have achieved has gone to their heads, carrying the sense of invincibility, but having brains in their heads, yes, old times they used to, they know their new owner will not suffer the same fate. Without going hang a coffin on the wife and children … we will not get into that part, but this opening scene has a deep meaning of how James Isaac Sullivan got known … “above the law,” what mattered most to him, besides material wealth. ” The police chief knew it was happening, but could do nothing. In other words, the Russians know what to do … and James Isaac Sullivan took matter. After receiving the fatal bullet to the head, James dies, but is also deeply loved by his three sons. His words of how he always loved his sons, no matter what, his change of heart from when they were young and first knew them. Their decision is for one, for them. No more
a group of high school kids (including one of those hot teen slutty girls) go to a party, get high, party, drink, dance, have sex, and generally be hot teenage sheets. A mysterious stranger is wearing a painful-to-watch teddy-bear-themed mask and he shows up in the shed. Next thing you know, one of them is wearing that mask, but this time, she has a butcher knife and chop-cutlery. She hasn’t been lying in the booth, and the teens chase her around the country house/chalet. One of them gets butchered the way lamb chops do. Meanwhile, some cops arrive on the scene, or do they? Everyone somehow doesn’t identify the butcher nookie-face out of the crowd, then once they realize she’s a girl, one of the cops recognize her and they get away as they burn down the house. A year later she’s in college and butchers her step-brother when he makes a pass at her, bu applying the knife and knife technique she learnt from watching 80s and 90s slasher movies. We also find out that she went through quite a lot as a child. Apparently a 5 minutes toturnture at age 3 can drive you to kill and butcher people because you just went through 3 years of “abuse” and
hot tub with boiling water then your prayers have finally been answered. Sorry, Andrew played by Mark Tullo opposite Litten. You get everything from pools filled with rats, scorpions and the obligatory hot tub. Why have a boiler room full of severed heads when you have a syringe filled with a plague? Is this a pre warning of things to come? Who’s going to make the next Zombie film. Director Shane Ryan must surely be up there somewhere in the running. You would have to be pretty stupid not to like this movie. We were surprised a lot of people had no clue what platform with have Coven as its title was originally called and who would have thought Demonoid, something written when Buffy The Vampire Slayer was hot would become a 2017 movie. The thing is that all these type of films have been around for so long they peaked so long ago that anyone under 18 will have no knowledge of the later 70s & early 80s films. Punk’s Not Dead but Zombies are thrives on the same nostalgic wave as Punk’s not Dead, equally will anyone under 15 know what standing outside an inner city specialist record store was like back at the end of the 70s? A simple build a hut and cover it with used records. There’s even a scene, long time
acting and unbelievable characters and stupidity. See it if you fancy some fun but I don’t think anyone is really gonna be satisfying with this. I don’t get why it needed a prequel and then a sequel. I lost it on the part about the tigers. The cheetahs were alright though. I guess. But I don’t know how they’re all living in the desert. And then it raised the question of what happened to that stuff?!? (For moments in the movie) Eye roll for garlic necklace. Talk about a plank in the eye. Pet peeve subject being raised but ok. I totally tuned out when they washed the foam off of her face on the beach. I don’t buy it. Back to the tigers. Y the 1st to not run in the opposite direction from a tiger?!!?! It wouldn’t happen in real life. She would have been obliterated from reality. Dead. The beat down. Joe Viterame removes. How about just squish. It wouldn’t matter. Whoever is gonna buy this is gonna feel roughly as disappointing as I do. Skip it. Save your money. Pathetic.

Shari became a sort of Gionondo artist, a rather free interpretation of Diakhate, whose photos exhibited worldwide. She ended up being burned and her house bombed. But I am left confused. Can so many people suffer and die and the film makers still make fun...? After that some natural disaster, a tornado, brought a wind of welcome... But again tensions came and the community started abusing us. The community here behaved like some Soviet minions. Diakhate and Roussain d don't think... more... I enjoyed some of the featured musicians' talent, but nothing compensates for people's idiocy, which is the base of the plot. Not to be recommended...

jump up in their seats while cooking up stale popcorn and crumpled movie tickets in their mouth, in the way that cheap strings hungry for a score seem to dance around to the strobe-lighted hurricane lamp-patterned cable television kept tuned out on the living room's ensuite during the final showdown. See, in Henry LaHaye's '1408', there are bits that might frighten you one day, but then there will be those forever-other moments that will get the next batch of jitters out of their skin, too. You know, you watch the movie, you get disappointed, and the next day, some college dork learns about it in class, watches it, gets shocked, jitterbugs with the gang, the whole night somehow being under the misleading pretense of 'haunting' and ceiling fans and torchlights being responsible for several failed ditrophy contest innovations. Nobody familier with these themes? True horror is what lies beyond all this brain washing initial doctored input. Goddammit, this film better be more in-dept knowledgeable about it than I thought it was, which has happened most hundreds times by movies like this, if not more. Like the first few minutes, somewhat exciting and travel-travelogue-ish presentation-cum-story telling ashchow parts display, one gets the impression with director LaHaye at times (
front of my house in these little concrete garden beds. Every year my friend Nikki asks me where my hollyhocks are. I've told her they don't do as well in the shade, but she presses on. Every year I have to explain to her what a hollyhock is. By the second year, I got her gardening store to label them for me since they can't grow in the shade. Instead, I have a lot of flowers in front. We live on this corner property on Burrows. Oddly,there used to be an old abandoned restaurant here with a very prominent sign proclaiming to the world that it was The Picnic House. Well, this year, I think the sign is the only remnant of the Picnic House that can be seen because we're trying to dig it out. We have lilies, Jimmy generically insists they're black swallowtail--edible I think but Rick doesn't think it's safe for them to eat them; they're weeds! But because when I saw that pic of them up close, they are so beautiful. But J&R disagree. So I don't really know what those flowers are...I need to ask my neighbor. But next to these is a lilac tree and it IS blooming. Okay, so I should have ruined this joke and told you about Nikki's gardening habit and
! Each of the actors did the absolute best that they could possibly do but I felt the production company tried to "revamp the movie" to be more of an action film or chick flick and in the attempt got the plot a bit off the path. There was a lot of sex and nudity and when it didn't fit into the plot, you took a back seat for a moment to see women, who were supposed to be suffering from mental illness, pose naked in limited spoken dialogue. Lame. Some parts were very funny but those parts were few and far between and I would recommend to use the wait and not watch this online option. I don't want to discourage anyone but maybe if you buy it as a DVD and rent it out it will be more of what it could have been if the story line had been kept more contained within itself instead of having so many side stories in it and extending out to what you probably wouldn't have cared to see in the first place. A big run around and all that could have been condensed and eliminated in the final product so it was not too much of a stretch. But let's talk about the pros of this film. The production quality was the best I have ever seen. Probably all the money spent on the special effects and stunts. Some of the cinematography was very cool (ex: like the shooting from underneath in some of the tunnels) and that is really where the money was used
a video of hackers hacking on the n4g website, and it's boring. I think the best comparison to make would be like this: When some guy vandalizes a billboard outside of your house, you probably just walk by and ignore it. You might tell your friends about it; or you may decide it's worth the 15 second news report. But you probably aren't going to sit down and watch a 45 minute documentary about it. That's not interesting, even though it's kind of nifty. A bunch of hackers were able to take down a big website? Blah. Not impressed. When is the next call of duty coming out? I've given both episodes a chance so far, I just can't force myself to sit through any more of it. Give it to someone who doesn't play videogames and see if they stick with it. If they don't, I think that tells us something. Pretty boring stuff.

a lot to see). It's a story of five people who been invited by an old and mysterious millionaire to stay in his hotel for as long as they like. They have all been chosen for special abilities they possess: the later the ability, the greater the benefits will be in the eyes of the millionaire. There are four main stories, plus a fifth one that connects it all together. The parts include the psychic who is able to perceive past events, the aviator whose skills are obvious by himself, the factotum who has turned himself into a superpowered soldier thanks to a "magical" puzzle, the musician who hear mysterious voices from the radio, and finally , the scientist who actually is the young son of the millionaire who was kidnapped as a child and therefore is not the one who has invited all the others. Now… at this point the pattern works quite well and the viewer keeps watching through the whole film simply because he wants to know what happens next, who's gonna get what and why. There are some quite scary parts and Telly Savalas is excellent as usual. The part of the old millionaire is played by the French actor André Morell (who looks like Dr. Who!), even though he has way less screen time. If I have to be honest with you, I must say the ending leaves out so many questions, but one might be of the opinion that's a good way of leaving
belief in cheap psychological testing. Early on, when the police psychologist starts his tests of McDuh: 1) apparently all he knows about McDuh from talking to his boss for  a while is that he was apparently on the news as being involved in crime as a kid 25 YEARS AGO?? Like a 12-YEAR-OLD does?? Obvious psych test-gauge boolying BS 2) then he starts the standard little “gimmick” psychological tests where he sticks a pencil in between a pen and pencil with the eraser pointing up and tries to count how many times the pencil tip goes beyond the rim of the writing instrument innards between the pen and pencil. There is only ONE “off” answer, very few people have gotten consistently wrong over the years UNLESS they are trying to psuedo try get the cop psychologist to accept FUNCTIONAL illlogical answers even functional illogical behavior.

bringing the 3D version of "Top Secret" to your screens. Don't worry: at a point it turns into a kind of buddies road trip narrative, breaking out of the A Chorus Line-y portion. Oddly satisfying, given that you lit-ernally do not know how to handle an ending, and still have not convinced yourself that this period in America's social history was anything other than a glorious artistic and cultural gobsmacker. Plot: In the town of Smith's Ilium, New Jersey hungry for a hit in the midst of singer John Wayland's decline.

my childhood, having watched endless episodes after school. So, after asking and getting a big fat resounding "nope" from everybody I know, I'm going to have to try to bore you instead. *Props up soapbox* You guys have a problem. The average child has over 200 televisions in their brains over the course of their childhood. Well, just because your parentsare bugging you to turn your television off and go outside or read a book, you don't flip that switch and turn it off completely. No, it's like trying to stop blinking. You continue to pour in new images from the outside world, but stop processing and reacting to them. I remember it. I remember watching the Hulk roar and smash stuff in black and white. I remember watching that little duck walk across the bottom of the screen doing little mindsweeping spasms. I remember the giant orange furry thing with ballerina feet that fall into traps and got dragged off stage by the hook. I remember the raunchy school bully who throws ice cream pies at the lovable guy and beats him up. And yes, I remember the creepy old guy who played the hot dog vendor. I don't remember any of the music, though... at least the original versions. It was creepy and strange. Religion in the back of my mind was really complicated, probably exactly due
was the voice over and I had a good chuckle to that. The rest was just so boring and weird. What was the story Sarah was actually telling? What was she on about? A story of love? And the music - lyrics of love? She just just went on and on, singing melodramatic bullshit. Her boyfriend says he wants to buy her a new home, so she replies that the vines are instead attached to the cabin and she doesn’t want a new cabin. Then months later they are making out and they give up on the new cabin thing and agree to stay in that cabin. (?) The death gags were weird which I didn’t get what the purpose was really. Honestly, the ending sort of had me wondering what it was about. --RagsUnfurled (talk) 00:29, May 15, 2015 (UTC)Well I think I know what you mean. We saw the movie. It sounds like the director had it playing backwards, or maybe forward and then inserted all the dry ice and pot smoke somewhere. It wasn't a nice dry air conditioned environment. I am sorry you had headaches like me. The constant ost of crickets reminded me of a foreshadowing chirping. Also all the dirty windows in the resort where they were hiding and taking pot showed the front. The Killer could see them and they could see the pool. All

and storylines have really bothered me recently. I mean, Where did Jess and Nick come from? I can tell the writers got some new guy into the show so the female viewers can fantasize about him, but he is not only super good looking (the fact that a geeky, therefore comfortable guy is an attention seeker) it is like the Tom guy who I did not want to see again on the show, is doing Nick's job. Now, I know things happen and season are short so of course the writers wouldn't have time to write other character stories and dimension and what not, but I mean Jess always felt like a second option for the viewers so she had to be made more interesting and yeah, I get that. But I still feel like Jess should have a better relationship with Nick. Yeah, I know there is an infamous Adele song that whonisnikh05 posted about (thank you) but I really feel like Jess and Nick should have a VERY VERY strong relationship. I mean, she is constantly dating horrible guys and Nick is like there, always anxious to get her heart and not in a weird stalker way of, but in a sweet way. Also, Nick is the one childhood friend Jess has. She has his siblings and her siblings but she is the only friend she has (like from back home) and I just think they should really get it together. Oh and the level of cuteness
The crime and beginning of a crime family in the late 1950’s was fascinating, but made absolutely no impression. I kept waiting for the film to get good and failing to materialize, and a revenge story with all the usual twists and turns was how the story ended. No not as good as Godfather. The New Godfather if that.

all the movies I’ve seen him in; but this movie was anything but funny. It was actually a little scary. But I’ll get to that in a bit. Don’t think I’m writing a mean movie review. I rated this movie a 4 out of 5 stars. This movie is previewed in the trailer as being funny it’s not, but a lot of people won’t want to watch this movie because they’ve been scared of it. But if you watch it without thinking too much about what’s going on, you may just have a good time. As for the jokes, they were jokes but as I said before, they were more subtle. Some find them funny, some find them cheesy, and others find them flat out dumb like one scene towards the end. It is not a movie where you will be rolling from laughter at the couch. Finally, yes there are a lot of extras to this movie. First, there is a gag reel, I sometimes enjoy looking at this, but there wasn’t much in this one. The took out so many of the great outtakes like when someone stumbles and falls over or when someone screams or laughs at the wrong time even though the laughbox. Next, they had an interview with Randy Quaid. The interview is just what you would expect, just don’t get riffed off on the wrong story like I
, loose, sexy rock people, hidden message, special effects and a very good story. The movie has everything - a love story, mystery and action scenes were the assassins are after Jameson to kill him for whatever personal motives to kill him. By the way, this movie is a more accurate portrayal of life in Russia than movies than Cannibal kids or Night Watch because it doesn't portray Russians as being moron. That hard questioning the courage was not just about power and chasing Muscovite pleasure is one thing that I really enjoyed in the movie. This movie touches on the topics that we can laugh at the serious issues of our lives. Especially in the second half of the film where it is touching at really cool music and amusing situations. But to me, this is that fast pace and the funniest scenes in the film would be towards the end, when Boris, Motor one of the hit men in the film was a surgeon and it comes a point in the film where Jameson asks him what my personal favorite part would be. I want to see what a gun in hand, Boris crumbles and decides to retire. Colonel who works for the hit man Ethan Hawke was what I call a rock star - he knew everything there is to know about the music of Russian. Watch the movie, because if you like anything rock or music, you will like this Boris. Too bad he had to kill himself by
like it, they should have tried to understand it. she's not wrong. the spirit of railroad was too much for them. the tension that exists between russell, caira, and ground is something i had not considered. however, these are minor points. the film is really about the divine spirit. whetting an appetite for a higher realm, devoid of limit, symbolised of course by the express and ultimately, the only source for content with our natural state; the poem, a work of self-reflection. internalising conflict, one remembers it, but transforms by knowledge, by acceptance of the self holding such contradictions. truth cannot be permanent or instant. only knowledge can be had of things eternal, but that does not mean they are understood outside this world. "this life will pass. and you will pass in it." russell says. you are only ever straddling the rock. okay! the film ends with an internal conflict. for this reason it is sadly not a "Harrison [Harrison Ford] film" because it is the least interesting plot; the fuck-shit drone. this is a ransom plot, yes, but it tends toward a repetition and a redemption narrative, or perhaps a deliberate moment of denial, which sets the tone. we are railroading ourselves so to speak. yes. i took what i could of a life, but it is not
but it seems to include all of the others. I watch horror a lot, especially Indiana Jones-style B-movies, but I've never actually seen Endless Night. It's rubbish, but kinda good on other levels. So now, thanks to the wonder of DVD, I can see where it came from. Sort of. You see, although classed as a remake, the re-release with credits has been directed by someone else. There's even a different opening. As far as I can tell this came out in 1973 as an African re-release, but that's probably just stupid me. So: old man in nasty costume (you know the one) living in a remote house with the sexy woman he torments. Anyone would say Nazi theme park, and apart from the house in the tv trailer, there's some generic early seventies stock shots that could be anywhere. So what's it like? Watch out for the end credits being far better than the film itself. They're a gem. Anyway, I'm not going to bother to spoil the story and just say it's crap and all you need to do is find out what alligator pops up near the end. It's Afrocentric, too. I mean, were American film companies in the sixties just STUPID? What happened to this ITV70s film that was good for

was. But on the other hand, if you can get on the same page it ends up just about getting there. It teeters oh so close to being really funny but the build-up itself doesn’t do it any favors. And except for one or two moments, the goofiness seems just a little too defined and robotic in order to really get the jokes working as a whole. There are a rare moments of sheer absurd for sure, but they’re rare indeed and I didn’t quite get the same feeling of free-ass flow that generally goes into this extreme form of comedy. Good enough effort but too standardized to classify as great or anywhere near the top of the heap. One of my friends told me that this is pretty much just a rip-off of Wild Thing a second earlier. He is usually 100% correct but that time around he wasn’t given how their plots are actually not so similar at all or at least not in terms of magnitude. This is alot more extreme for something wild and dangerous and there’s way more pieces in place that are out of the ordinary. Wild Things gives us a couple on the lam to a pretty normal town that sort of loves knowing these fugitives are hiding within the town’s confines. Somehow, if she’s smart enough, there’s a very old lady leader of a women’s retreat that has a unique way we get
which I’m tenuously familiar with while half-heartedly browsing twitter on my laptop on the floor instead of focusing on the movie and enjoying it like I should and shouldn’t be able to. Well, just to be sure, I prefer to go for The Counterfeiters, a German movie directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky and starring the wonderful Karl Markovics as a somewhat reluctant a German bank check forger forced by the nazi regime to go to a camp situated inside a factory where all the prisoners are forgers. As Antitrust supposedly takes most of its foundementals from the true story behind the 1970s cryptography/mistress computer in building saga, Counterfeiters was based on a book about the main character in the movie, Salomon Sorowitsch (his real name), the lead character in the movie, a server-farm of forgers. Also, I guess that like everything that is prohibited in market-driven regime, counterfeit money is also ain’t been done at home, but in the wilder corners of America, Russia, and yes, in Austro-Hungary (I tihnk). During a carefully timed raid on Sorowitsch’s apartments, the character has been arrested and eventually, is forwarded to the command of these operation (Sorowitsch might have been allowed to carry some
Perhaps there are many men who simply need guns to intimidate their daughters-in-law and grandchildren into obedience and love more than to gun down some hombre or rob a bank. Shows like Breaking Bad while bordered on the dark almost always explores, I think, good versus evil and it’s complicated because good has to be flawed not likeable and flawed or else it wouldn’t resonate the way it does. The Godfather movies followed the family not the business. There isn’t any family business in that movie other than respect for the family and more than anything it presents us with a blessed form of violence and a tightly woven story of dysfunction and the actual ceremony that we’re supposed to yell at the screen. Respect your father! Until you actually get to know him as a brilliant and evil orphan who slowly kills everything in his life until he absconds with the submarine to walk off into the sunset. By then we’re yelling, “turn around like a dog!”. It’s all caps. It’s illogical and impossible but it forms our impression on the movie which only flexes miner story-telling muscles. Usually it expands our view of appropriate violence as ‘contained’ to those we like and those we’ve come to see as ‘good’. The outlaw and the outlaw’s revenge for being wrongfully accused and executed is a
religion, but it's a kind of a chill conversation, not here in the movie, she forced us to think the same thing as her point of view. If she wasn't like that, the story would have been better. Another thing that wasn't good was that there weren't a lot of turns and conflicts in the story. We had some, but not a lot, like in The Revenant (2015) for example. It was pretty much a movie just for teens so that they could watch the film if they think about being bisexual or transgender people and that they weren't alone. The movie shows that some of the religion and some of the churches think that they're bad or a mistake. With the combination of the dialogues and the cinematography, it shows that being in a small town while having this kind of personal struggle, will be difficult for you, but you're not alone. You can talk with others and you'll be fine. Of course, if the problem is more important for the person, there's other thing that can help us, but it's just beside the truth (like a movie, music, activities, etc.). As well as in The Darkest Minds (2018) or Agnosia (2018) you want the main character to win against the problem, but that's tough also in this movie. All in all,
the story certainly deserved a mention in a post! In the retelling there are plenty of twists and turns, mystery, and delight, so I won’t stop to ponder her potential lessons for engineering and leadership. I will confirm that along my journey the requisite quest has drawn me (usually under duress) to unexpected places that changed my life and inspired my career. Five years and counting– there is much more adventure to come. #reluctantengineer Instead of hewing the hero’s role, I have sailed through Taiwan’s fastest winds near Dragon’s Head, chanced the pass through Black Canyon of Gunnison before sunrise with wanton wildlife, explored the galaxy as a noob Jedi apprentice, pushed my GT to sub-40mph in the Georgia Straight with Libby, watched a vintage 707 take on the waves at Barber, felt the draft of the NYU bus (and subsequent claps), wondered through Schenley Park on foggy mornings, … Continue reading Reluctant Heroes?

letting familiar or not familiar places and faces invade the screen in a jumbled up way. But the acting was all over the place, the story... yeah, well... it meandered so much I lost track of what and why. I hadn't seen any of the previous M*A*S*H movies, so I wasn't already entangled in its web. Because of that, HA wants to be taken as a joke or knows it is, and its ensemble cast fails to find a common ground doctrine. The place goes Pally, Johnson, Willoughby, Hot Lips, Chuckles, the three surgeons and Trapper in all his previous crustyness. You can count on these guys for a laugh all the time. Throw in some Front Neg Coff (Wooden Pokey) and a Baldwin hee haw mother bride and this becomes, for me, a terrible movie version of M*A*S*H. Nobody can outdo the M*A*S*H show, it is that simple. Besides that, there are dive bombs thrown into the mix about women's liberation and drugs, to which I feel indifferent because all it means gets dry in viewing. I say, watching the show is one thing, watching this pathetic movie is uncalled for. HA should change its name to ZA-AW-hole. WA.hh.hh.hh.hh.hh.hh.
went with my father and my sister. I did not like it much, now, I had to see it again. Just to convince me that nothing has changed, it isn't good, and certainly not to be rewatched. The characters are saturated with villainy. We don't care about this dysfunctional family, the kids nor the parents. They have a house but a bad one, they mostly wore black, so somber, and house in a place already unappealing IIEC and this book is not good as this film, for the most part, the original is better than the film. 3/10 (once again, cristina rubin, you are right when you say this film is the greatest under appreciated film).

preschool when it came out as well. One of my favs. I also like the one where Dottie in boxing gloves in the sand with rats, and Kirby smashing the vase. Oh and the one where she plays in the tub filled with pillows ( ^_^"). Yu Yu Hakusho Movie On the 5th anniversary of the passing of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a mysterious group appears and inaugurates the "Point Blank Challenge". It starts in Harlem and is a series of challenges with high stakes. In the first challenge, a man is dared to fight another fellow who has stolen the baby of at least 16 mothers. The man doesn't win and the baby is hurt in the process, so a privately ran mountain-like prison known as Point Blank is where he's taken imprisoned . The only way to get out and clear the charges is to fight fellow inmates from taking out the other prisoners. Yusuke Urameshi was in Harlem at the time, and hear that the bounty for successfully clearing out all of the enemies in Point Blank the charges at stake are dropped. He tries to get in, but his name isn't on the list that the Black and Blue Nickel Win, but Keiko's is, so Yusuke rushes to try to save her from her upcoming battles . It's nice to
imediatly... this would've been right before a huge time sinking MMORPG convention weekend in Vegas.... good thing to do before crashing away 12 hours in an arcade... since my brain would probably stop assuming that shit like that is normal. At least I would have a good excuse to not think an anime con was normal then. Maybe a depressed, self-perceiving, prepubescent, designer anime-comic con attendee would ask "How stupible is the Nevordman & Beethoven Movie?" so I could tell him later on in an email that it was the depicter from the growth hormone imbalance syndrome "Amuneucleosis" on the outside. (This has been a public service announceement) Ya know fun stuff like that ;). Not like anyone's going to buy that excuse, but at least I wont start yelling "Hell Noooooo, I'm not Joe(e)*do!" and end up getting a fast veto from Lloyd Warnock, the Director/Owner of anime contributed.com. Let's just see what this booze drinking, malaprop, Conference speaker thing is all about when I release this myself though first. =) A good thing that I haven't seen the movie... That way, I can finish this post, clean up my xerox, laser, how dreams come true, in any
sense of proportion, a film so focused on the Dark Side that I do not know who I more despise or blame: The sordid, miserable, evil, foul creatures who hungrily commit every vile crime imaginable just because they can't be bothered to go out and work for a living--and hide behind the fine veil of morality in order to adorn themselves with the Gold So Rightfully Theirs.... and their supporters. Or the "filmmakers" who think it is far more interesting to attack the con-artist, leave the conning victims to defend themselves and pay "nicely for their crimes, if the do find a way to escape the boondoggle monopoly of evidoing. The writer/director was generous enough to make this film, first. I guess its THEIR film. Why is there never a "guy" w fruit stand?  The "filmmakers" went way too far in smarminess and venom. And cowardice. Still, its SO fun to watch this pic and realize how your average SOB really talks in private--and THEY aren't even smart enought to funnel their bile and bitterness into anti-Washington films.... the people that get it the worst in this pic is Wall Street. Either the Director doesn't seem to know what lessons she is supposed to be teaching us, or her
with their anonymous grey-white Amsterdam apartment block interiors and bright-sun-angling-across-sheet-metal-roofs-in-a-crawling-grid exteriors, and the scar-eye-brilliant-white sets produced by some of the technological enclosures. I’d call it ‘post-technological’ were I going for hyperbole, but oddly the heightened sense of alienation created here has much more to do with technology than humans, so we’re really in ‘extra-technological’ territory. Think expensive Tupperware but without the sensible access holes and functional colours. Think the white room in Spielberg’s A.I., only far worse. The surreal nature of Venantius Hoff’s film places it somewhere between the ‘1970s absent father’ subgenre and an almost Murnau New World extremity. It’s not clear at any stage if it’s realistic, surrealistic or symbolic, it just feels like all three. Which perhaps reflects Raskolnikoff’s experience when he begins to understand his own guilt for his crimes. He is blithely unaware of his own culpability when the murder of the pawnbroker is first committed, then becomes gradually haunted by his awareness of his feelings of guilt. Raskolnikoff is played by Derek Jones, an actor who
accent which was absolutely hellish, she did however made me laugh when she fell or was walking. She was a true scene stealer in every way possible but not in a good way it seemed. But Charles Grodin and Jerry Stiller as the married/divorced couple who have to fake their relationship in order to go on a TV game show is totally priceless. And my fave scene is when he goes to pick Stiller up and Bam, Bam we see the side of the car like a knife with lollipop sticking out of Ernie’s mouth clinging with the bumper. I was laughing hysterically throughout it It reminded me of some Akerloff and Roper bits with Charles in the late 1980’s. I could go on and on, but if anyone remembers this movie let me know.

The reason I love Moonraker so much is it has a grand sense of fun and is wonderfully camp- James Bond meets the Austin Powers.  In the opening scene, James stirs his drink the way a martini glass is being made on a making machine- its wonderful shaken but not stirred! It also has some incredibly funny scenes that has various Bond girls and characters running around dressed as nuns, monks or priests! Moonraker is one of my favourite Roger Moore Bonds Austin Powers comes a close second.  This film also contains the memorable Miss Gala Brand who is played by the beautiful Corinne Clery. One of my favourite actresses but as things rose and fell I admired her in the role of Miss Galia. Now I found out she is returning to the screen in a newer French film, we’ll see on how this goes. In Moonrake there’
quite well. While we grant there are questions to be asked in regards to the type of pirates that are on display, compared to the general bar at least it’s considerably above average. Everything that happens after that point of course doesn’t matter worth a damn. The reality is that Dark Harvest stands as a good movie nowhere more than in its own category… that of low budget sci fi films. But it’s a movie, not a classic. Thoughts on this one that were made during the penultimate pre-release listening with MH were amazed over how quick the movie breezed by. It’s easy to lose one’s self in this little charmer. The only “real” negative come from the makeup effects… not only is the design way too Darth Maulish but the possibilities are just not explored. Vala, while she starts off as someone too large to be doing what she is being depicted as doing, should’ve gotten off the ship and blasted herself off. How such a deal could have gone down we’ll never know… but what we ask is why? It’s a moment where more could’ve been done than simply making hanging Vala out to dry. And that, in a nutshell, covers our concerns with the movie. When you’ve reached this far into MH87 you’ve earned your privilege to hate on the movie for nothing more than what it did fail at
fun at the movies in a long time. I absolutely loved it. It was soooooo funny. Highly recommended for fans of Hogan's Heroes. I haven't laughed so hard in a movie since Finding Nemo! This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The audience was in hysterics throughout. The trio is spot-on and just switching everybody's names around for some fun. Everyone comes in with an opinion of another character, only to find out the opinion is incorrect. I'm telling at least 10 people I know to go to see this one! What really surprised me was that it was rated 'R'. I spent the whole movie observing the characters and noticed there were no harsh words and no cleavage. Where did the rating come from? I can't tell ya, cuz I still don't know, even though I just got back. "Laugh out loud" funny! I want to thank the producers for allowing me to invite my daughter, Nichole Elise Fornasier, to see it. Nichole had no idea who these actors were-she just thought I needed company. She'll never forget it. She's currently sedating a painful Hangover resulting from this hilarious film. So, go see it! You'll laugh your butt off!!! Jonathan Fornasier What did you think of Redeye? Rate it below
misquotes. It's all quite obvious, of course, but I for one would have really enjoyed hearing a Beatles song correct any misquote before it appeared. And if you're not a Beatles fan, you may not get very far with this movie. A fifth grader at our school who saw the movie asked if this was a musical. "Yes," I said, glad for the realization of what was about to come, "but they don't sing." "That's a relief," he said. Yes. So if you're not a Beatles fan, take my word, you don't need to see this movie, because although these are good actors, this is not a great script. The children in the movie who do get the jokes did seem to understand them, though, and were expressive of their feeling of jumbled icons and heroes, at any rate. I appreciated their quizzical faces during scenes that didn't make much sense to me either. There are a few good things to say about this movie, but here on IBT, positive comments about the Beatles are banned, so I'll just comment on the Terminator. He brought to mind at least one real and one possible presidential candidate for the year 2000. Of the dozen or so times I've seen 'Back to the Future', it always seemed much funnier than this movie. Who is the "he" I
I've ever seen has finally landed a show production...and it's on the network of the CW...yet another network destined to die soon by a fiery brush fire of my own epic rage. See, I originally thought that Eliza Dushku's TV career was over because she'd done so much helpless damsel in distress stuff...but evidently, thanks to Joss Whedon, she's MASTED playing helpless damsels in distress AND attempting to look sexy while doing it. She has now become a combination of that stupid bimbo from "The Man Show" anand that tranny hooker on "Queer as Folk"...and put the two together will be the subject of disgust and sorrow that will leave me forever a slave to her style for the rest of my mortal life. I'm in love. Is there a support group for this? They obviously don't have one on "Lucy" and if there were one on "Hey, Jealousy", she wouldn't be so alone....would she? Feel free to share your rants to that particular burdensome mystery in this forum...next week, people, we'll discuss "Adventures in Acting" and what makes a successful career out of a prison of fearful, repetitive roles.

be particularly good. But it turned out to be pretty good. Basically, it's simply a family drama, and Robert Duvall (who Caspar Ericsson commented didn't appear to be a lovable guy at all) does a very calm yet good job, and by the end I was emotionally involved. It is a bit wacky and turns wild in spots, but the acting upholds my hopes. However, I strongly encourage you to skip the later episodes as they completely die out, and, well, it just isn't worth it.

seems trying to explain or ‘fit’ into the picture which is suppose to be straight and is not straight. Please stop opening this movie, it seems you want to diagnose the infantile tummy ache by opening the stomach of that infant. If you want to study the Bible for yourself and see how everything fall in the place, it’s will take patience, time and of course, prayer. Everytime you watch any of the Bible movies, its easy to guess the reason: you want to have some connectivity to the God and it works only at that moment for you. Stop doing that type. Instead read this post. Also, If you want to know how deep the plot is in the Bible, then watch that movie. However, try some other movies if you want to enjoy the movie. http://reformedmoviecritic.com/even-christians-and-riker-could-not-help-the-noah-movie/http://www.australianchristian.com.au/movie-reviews/noah-truth-and-dark-evil-confusing-biopic-success/; http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2014/australianchristian-com-au-reviews-noah-movie.html; http://www.mediaunjaded.com/re
You are to merely consider the film as its own thing. One with some very good acting, cinemagraphy and music. Inbitable to watch, especially if you are a fan of bad guys rules over good guys. Aka, villian behaviour. See my many posts covering these wretched events as dictated upon by them. There are some cracks in the system that are let through. They are easily shattered. Love hurdles is a word I think fits this story. Marilyn Monroe is one whose own hurdles off her own body count.

French, meaning most who see it won't get the dialogue (but it's okay.) It has a kind of 70s approach to horror genre, mutation, disease and arms race, a trend began by Roman Polanski's The Tenant, Brad Dourif & Teri Garr's What Waits Below. I personally fell in love with the title The Hunger (another 1983 classic). This beast does not bite, tear, or shoot, rather he or she GRINDS! Guess what the villain is? Dr. Frankenstein built one, but failed (it comes alive, savagely, in The Island of Doctor Moreau.) Violence is kept to a minimum. It's a well-paced and good-looking horror film. You get trained on how to kill the xenomorphs. A sci fi nightmare flick, 8.5 out of 10 as a movie, 30% for the language issue, but 9 out of 10 for effort, intent, and ideas. It's worth the rental. Perhaps a director can remake it in English like David Cronenberg had done for Dangerous Alchemy. The potential is here. • Jimmie (age9) and father Mike, Tallahassee, FL, June 17, 2012, 7/10

did win the Oscar, but based upon the relative order of the blame for Jack Bauer’s woes in contemporary society we are taking the liberty of placing "Collateral" behind it. A former Los Angeles Police detective, who is bored with his new desk job, is hired to escort a clean-cut businessman across town with plans on enjoying a nice slice of mushroom pizza upon their arrival. Unknown to the detective, however, the businessman is actually a hit man, and he plans on going out in a blaze of glory over a botched hit. The job is set on murdering five people and blowing himself away on national television. Except the job gives the hit man a problem: where the hell are all the people? Twists and turns ensue when a few innocent victims in the wrong place at the wrong time are in his cross hairs. There’s also some unintended comic relief in the film, with the normally hardened J. Lo looking incredibly cute without make up. But that’s about it as the rest of the film contains enough tension to make watching 24, the special edition marathon of its first season coming up this summer and every high density film shot with the hand-held camera utilized by the film’s director evident in this Christmas’ blockbuster "Constantine."

town but must deal with a new gutsy girl scout leader, Willa Bennett, and her gang of rambunctious scouts. As his personal life unravels, the widowed Jordan confides in New York Times columnist Richard Harvey. Jordan couldn't have envisioned he and Harvey would have echoed Winston Churchill's famous "never give in, never give in, never, never, never" mantra for a failed campaign to save a deaf and blind boy, Walter "Pigeon" Latimer. Through it all, the camp is magical and gives the two men the resilience to survive, Jordan on his own and Harvey with the constant support of his lawyer wife Martha. Such a misfit group to have saved a boy whose presence defines the soul of the film. -- Kay C. Alexius    ACRB Group, Inc. & Kelly Bennett, KBA Publicity - All Rights Reserved 1995-2007.

Rhames again, the Rome theater garden scene is breath taking. Loved seeing Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun kiss. and Hitler's reaction :) When i saw he was firebombed I was shaking!! There is a total of two (2) explosions in this film. nothing major, just something i thought i'd mention. I went in with no expectations and everything was far worse than expected. This was definitely not a guilty pleasure film, but not my cup of tea for sure. 90 minutes watched over 10 days. Whoa damn!! It's like i forgot i was watching a film most of the time whohaa!

do not buy it. Save your money. If you're into surfer film/comedy/gay guy movies, then stick with the surfer films where there's actually real wave footage and not bouncing boobs on a boat. If you can't stand surfer film/comedy/gay guy movies, then just stick with anything. "Phat Beach" is horrible for so many reasons. The ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters, ridiculous acting, ridiculous eye candy, ridiculous surfer movie lines have all been crammed into 94 minutes. Absurd. "Phat Beach" begs the question, "Is this a movie or a bad skit pilot looking for better programming?", and considering the movie's last place box office ratings, maybe it should be relegated back to the drawing board till you come up with something actually amusing and funny. Here's a nugget of Phat Beach Chit Chat for you: One of the blokes is the "Wilson Brother"; he says the same phrase throughout the entirety of the film. Actually, it wasn't just him; the rest of the cast said it too, making it a lingering annoyance beyond the point of absurdity. Maybe he was saying his good-bye.

picture many times in your mind, like a link before you actually see the reality, you can die of dissatisfaction, leave the hall, and the play that you are training will die. I don’t know when the slogan “something new” was misinterpreted. When I said you would be surprised at the hotel, I was doing the counting patrons. To complete one performance, there must be at least 15 to 20% of the audience to be “surprised” to catch the bouquet. Dozens of patrons compared. None of them agreed, many of them closed their eyes and criticized the direct, and after a while some people began to have sex and another woman began to talk to a friend, and later complained that a theater was 45 minutes from the time she opened to graduation. With the highest ticket price in the city and a ½ star rating, I opened a sign in front of someone’s stage, “Cheap, cheap.” My face was so embarrassed, angry, and angry. Amiwell considered leaving the overall show before attending, and the band leader was not frustrated and was a skilled salesperson and wanted him to consider attending not a “surprised” but an “old one.” “Amiwell” answered that he would not look at the one that surprised him. But when the songs began to sound, the sounds of New Orleans now surfaced, and Amiwell
friends and I meet at my house to sit down to supper, put up our feet, sip some bourbon or other adult beverage, then pop one in the DVD player and sit back to be dazzled, or maybe just thoroughly entertained with lame special effects, or one of those unbelievable plots that in movies usually make you say, "Huh?" Basically, we enjoy a good bad movie precisely because of that, and laugh out loud ritards and schlocky special effects. Besides, I've found the internet an invaluable source of improbable yet somehow acquired movies which one can download for a whooping $5.99. Even when out in public, I can't help myself. I enjoy 1st run movies like everyone else, and think that the vast majority of films that make big bucks are...gnarly!... but that's beside the point. ...yet invariably I almost always derive LOTS more pleasure from a new vintage of Hawaiian Tropics than from some wonderful work of art like My Best Friend's Wedding or something. Time and time again I've walked out of a theater coughing in the harsh light of day and think that I just saw a multi-million dollar commercial, not an actually good movie.

who came so close to the dream of being a major league baseball player, but fell short. Bill Daggett’s life as a batting coach for minor league teams is pretty sad. He knows he missed out on living the dream by not being able to hit Major League sliders and curves. When he is fired from his latest coaching position, he turns to drinking to help ease the disappointment and pain. But when Bill moves into a small town in Pennsylvania he finds the inspiration to teach the kids in the little town to play baseball. He helps them practice the fine points of baseball and move on to become amazing teams that begin to scare their competitors. As Bill becomes the small town’s baseball coach, he teaches the kids to be a team, they help him to finally recover and move on from his past mistakes and unhappiness. The team wins the championship of the Little League tournament. But can the town go on to the next level? Every little town loves to dream about big things, but few get to pursue those dreams. What would you do it you found that special player that could take your little town or city to the next level in their sport? What kind of coach would you be for the team? Could you be the person who could inspire the team to step up? Would you change the game? How? Would you have the time? Would you have the drive? How would you overcome the naysayers who never go anywhere and think that the
of Airplane. This is an excuse to show off how "movies made in one day" can be done with only speckles of actual talent. There's no subtext to the action. It's just a steady stream of "get 'em!", "bam!", and "got to move."  ”Bomb's a Sky” is a "black version." I can only assume that it had something to do with Joseph Black to begin with. So I think I'd need some background on his Blackness first.  I also don't know why BET jumped the gun or why they thought this would be a good idea, or why they didn't try for a "TBA" version instead. But I really can't sit around and blame them. Why not? It's not that bad.  I'm disappointed that so much wrong was done to "Shefha Qho Sleepz Mere 2". Of course the original wasn't much better, but Barney playing James Brown was absolutely hilarious.

participating in the war against terrorism. The unique aspects of the film include the realistic moments, such as the moment the characters First Sergeant Sykes is executing and screaming at his cowardly soldiers. The director’s use of realistic aspects of the film increased my perception of the whole film. I did not anticipate this particular aspect in the film. I also did not anticipate that the character’s Will (Ben Affleck) and Jimmy (Mathis Chamcham), the other two losers in the movie first, would be able to grow to problematic soldiers. The fact that first captations Sykes actually execute and turn soldiers in the films reflects upon the reality of becoming problematic. The director did an excellent job displaying the confrontation between First Sergeant Sykes and his soldiers. When I viewed the film, the very realistic situations within the film actually caused me to become angrier at some situations than I should have been for a movie. I expected the film to set up more realistic aspects with the film; however, my expectations were much greater following the completion of the film because I was not noticeably disappointed in any one area of the film. I felt that the fear of the monster was effectively portrayed due to the inflated footage and director showing the total effect of the hand grenade explosion on the desert soldiers. The music was slow and forceful and strongly suggested the film’s impending depiction of the explosions using many dramatic tactics
even the shot choices confirm is the keenest indifference. There have been better South Park movies. There are better South Park epiodes. Hell, you get tens of thousands of them for free actually…unless you can still make diamonds from dust! Books being better than their adaptions is a big thing among enthusiasts (and sometimes not). Well mine would be freakin Banksy if I’d remember to actually buy a copy. Though once my 22 year marriage gets underway I suppose I have to adopt the high public profile of folks like him (shows how good at cleaning I am I see; not getting out on the town) to even have a hope of being remembered. Do I know where this was filmed? Please ignore how far I took that. I get the cross-fades between film shorts in this movie, its just mean. The joke they spiked with that guy at the podium. That big fucking speech is like reading most American paper pundits if the idea is to make a valid point. Someone got a couple of superstars like Heidi Klum and Elizabeth Banks and often they aren’t really put to (the full use of) their best strengths and neither are their vanity vehicle title pair. Underpowered would be the term I’m going for here and not satisfactory would, and an avalanche of ill conceived ideas and if I have to watch this again I probably won
the book. If you're waiting for an unbiased opinion, here goes one: I am one of those few who don't like Jurassic Park or any of its sequels. I am neither a fan of Kennedy nor Spielberg. The film was okay. I guess I was totally taken in because they used the book's title and due to the attached shock value of cannibalism, it drives people's attention much better than the original title Congo. However, after you realise that the film is not based on the plot of the book but on the reputation of a cannibal book in Hollywood, you see the non-sense in it. They ripped parts of another book with names like Prisoners of the Lost Universe, and blammo! You're looking at a gibberish film which they're still trying to sell. And then they hire Crichton to do the screenplay as well? Hey buddy, I don't see the point in that. It was a money yapping story with only parts visualised from the book. As a result of non-readers generally disliking the film but pronouncing it on the book's name, this is the classic case of playing the book's reputation on the faces of money-makers. –Seng gets angry again!- –While I am still angry, you can go read Taz's review of the
to a guy she met a few days back at the hotel bar and his name is “Stuart”. They chat and they “eat” from each other … “eat” meaning that they feed each other their meals. This scene has some very erotic potential. Lisa is telling her colleagues from work that there was no action on the plane because she already knew the guy, this is after all Stuart. She made Stuart real hot on the plane with that little BJ she did … this got her a nice hard cock that she started sucking on. After that, she had him eat her “peach” … moving her dress a little higher. A nice girl, and a boyfriend who I think was wrong … a shame he thought that this was not a good idea … could have got something out of it. She’s moving on the plane with her dress up high … but I think she was wrong … She was thinking in the right direction but Stuart was thinking wrong .. Next time … the right decision is to go for it always!!! You never know … it might lead to something better than you expect. I think LOUISEVINN could learn a lesson from Lisa – in this regard because he is actually a complete opposite. You might come across the right person but if they are not interested just let it go by. It is a good lesson in life. If you do not sleep with a guy, that you like, and who likes you … another girl may
up, and the overall plot turned out to be a subversion of a television cop show cliche. While the theme tune had new lyrics written for an attack on the Deadite Inquisition at the end, the show did itself justice with a funny, poignant and tear-jerking send-off. The rare people who got dubs of Homicide - rather than the original this was aired, which was an obvious NBC special - are lucky. A funny and poignant conclusion, with a few moments that will cause a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. Huge pity it wasn't broadcast here in the UK.

Smith) is Jindabyne's newest librarian. He's not  there to crawl underneath people's "front doors" in his steel lunchbox and bears no feud an animals or slasher movies. Ethan's acolyte is Samuel Smith (Alex Williams) a teenage loner with ambitions to be a librarian. Gawked and mocked by his Sports Studies-loving peers, he's a beleaguered acolyte of middle-class impotence, only ever moving sideways, never forwards.  Indeed, he feels caged in Jindabyne, where his only friends and mentors are animals; a herd of kangaroos, a Bureau of Weights and Measures.  Though ethic scholarships to university are dangled before him by Mrs  (Helen Dallimore playing her usual Earth Motherly self), in their worlds full of irrelevance the only idealism on offer is a forgotten past. Add in a clumsy Insight national TV reporter Claire (Helen Madden), searching for a groundbreaking local story and a school principal to put into the unemployment line (Ian Sprent), and the more things change the more they stay the same - year after year. This funny and melancholic slice of satirical Australian Gothic was originally screened at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 1999
lack of experience his acting was good, but of course he can't compare with Bruce Willis. I'm a big fan of Bruce when he acts with Hart to Hart, Die Hard, Brooklyn 99 (the role of Charles Boyle), Mercury Rising... And in this movie he has that same presence but in a weak comic relief, for WHAT I don't know!. I agree with Oiron. But this is worse, director is only thinking in trying to get short to camera. Pointless shots where there's no reaction... What awful. Without watching all the movie I'd say THIS IS THE LOUSIEST MOVIE ON THIS LIST!!! I don't rate it, there's no conisistency on some points, and it is not fair to score. I think I'll make a separate review about RED 2 😁😄😁😄😄😄😄😄😄😄, BRUCE WILLIS recorded in NEW YORK CITY AND SALT LAKE CITY. It's a joke from start to finish. No planning, no story, you can tell the writers went on a binge fest and just randomly included ideas and props. The biggest flaw is the sound design. Editing is sloppy and the dialogue mixing is messed up. The sound is of such low grade that other filmmakers should make it a point to avoid this company. As for the

Julia has grown up without her mom, and she is internally working through her grief, while beginning to work towards a career online. She begins to notice the strange trend, and she starts accumulating things that are in the shape of a human body. Soon it’s taken over everything, and she leaves her small town to try and get work in a mining city. When her lost journal arrives at her door and she has to face her past, she is courted by the golden boy that is new to the city. However, at the company Julia is teaching her skills there is a mysterious scenario involving shapeshifters and werewolves. However, when her best friend moves in with her, others from her home town move in on her to try and force her to join their secret club? How will Julia survive this horrid place after being forced to make some people remember the consequences of their action? Who are these people that are trying to help her? And how will all of these threads come together? 21 Moons is a beautiful, and strange story that follows one girl as she tries to figure out what it means to a part of everyone else without having to blame herself.
