such. That was one thing I could say in its favour; it wasn’ t trying all that hard to trick you into going to the movies and getting a false sense that you were going to a proper drama. It is about a love triangle that unfolds at a wedding and is told in a flashback, with the characters as an older generation and as the older people they once were. And that’ s about all that is interesting. Even my coz thought it was too cheesecaky and I did too at times. But it could have worked too with just the right cast, but the casting is not so great. There’ re a few good performances and there is definitely a good story to tell, and a good film to be made about this novel by Susan Minet. But the casting was all over the place, though the direction was solid (Mira Nair, who has made two of my favourite movies – SALAam Bombay! and MISSION INDIN) and there wasn’t a lot wrong with it. But you could see why it was not a great hit. It seemed to want to keep a bit at a distance, so you never really connect with it and I guess it was too artsy a film for a chick flick and too chick flicky a film to play well with a serious movie crowd. And yet it was all rather sweet and I found myself not being too annoyingly bothered by it and having fun in the end
an indie budget is nothing but more reason for people in the film industry to look out. The story is pretty basic and doesnâ€™t have much of a plot and this is something I felt a little letdown by when it came to itâ€™d potential, it just lack in a few departmentâ„. The acting is very good. The effects are fantastic and there is nothing but a beautiful presentation going on here, even if the film is missing some of what could have been a great story but Iâ€™ll admit that it was very well made and worth a couple of rents. I personally recommend it to anyone who thinks they would be able handle the dark feel and themes that this film has to give. I also recommend it to people looking for something to watch when you just want to throw in a DVD blind, no questions and no explanatoryâ„. The cinematograph is great, with beautiful settings that will really let you relax in your seat and let the film play out and the score is fantastic! It will keep you focused throughout the duration of the film and keep you guess on the what is to come. I personally enjoy seeing films that are not mainstream because there can be some nice surprisâ„. The acting is very good here, with performances by Jared Leto, Linda Hunt, Shannan Dooley, and James Woods. This really is a great film to throw on in your home theater without any other expectations
does not deliver any more than the previous episodes have in terms of character development or the storyline. The first three episodes all followed one after another with very few breaks which is not the case with episode 7. You get to hear from Jack Reacher and his crew a bit of back story but that’s really it. There’re still huge pieces of the story that seem to have been forgotten or overlooked and it just frustrates me. This series deserves so so much better then some of it it’ve gotten. It’s one thing when I feel like the author and I can see things going different ways as far was the characters and what not but with this series there are so many obvious missed opportunities and even worse is I think it’ll never go any farther. It feels like it’t just been abandoned. I’ll admit in some ways I don’t mind because it did help me not feel so stressed to figure out who’ll live and who’ll dies at the end of each new episode, but in other it really is hard because I want to know what happens but there’t no way in hell I’m going back and re read books I’ve read over 6 years ago. I’ll keep with this story just to prove it out. It’s 2nd episode of season 1 was one of my favorite reads so I hope it delivers. But as of right, I don.t have high hopes
England, it tells the tale of a series  murders in and around a castle which has been turned over to a mental hospital for children. A doctor (Gabry Roberti) is sent by the hospital authorities but it becomes clear to everyone that someone is picking off patients and staff members alike and he may be the next victim. The doctor' s fiancee (Fulvia Franco) goes to investigate and the police are called in but the killers keep at it. It' s not clear if the patients are responsible or maybe it's the care-givers or the hospital administrators or the doctors or, most sinister of ally, maybe all of above. It' s one of the most interesting films of it type I have seen in the genre and I was surprised by several twilites. Highlights are the creepo 3rd act where all mayhem ensues including a niffty stinging stinger (ha) and a nice last frame twist in the style of many of Mario bava' 's later works including his great giallo " Blood And Black Lace. This is a must see and is as good as the best giallas that Dario argento or Mario bava ever did. I didn' t see a US video version for this and this was released by an Italian company as a limited box but I have seen it on a DVD on a Japanese 2 disc label. Both are a little rough but still
Newton's Second Law, yet they have never read it! So let’s read Newton'' second law again. "F=ma". Newton'' law actually refers to both of its equations taken in combination. The force on a body, is equal to its mass times the rate of change [(or acceleration)] of its velocity, in direction and sense. This can be stated as follows: If a change in an object [for any amount] occurs, a force has acted on it. This is one equation of Newton and he derived it through observation. Newton also came to the second equation as a result of his observations regarding what we now refer to, graviation. Newton used the principle to explain the motion of a cannon- ball or a billard ball. Now, if we substitute the word gravity for force (and also assume that the gravitational pull on the object is constant) for any change in an obect, there would be an accelerating force. (The accelerating force would be the gravitational pull). Thus accelerating [the change in speed and direction] is the key to the second equation of force, which is a universal law. Let me add one more thing on this subject. We must remember that there has to exist the possibility and the potential for change in an item before any force can be applied to it for that item then [it will be effect and change]. The force will act only on the object or entity that has the
musical dramas tend to stumble a little out of their self-impressed gate, Smile Time made an honest bid for a new kind of camp. "A lot will get left to the imagination in terms of what our world is like, or how we're different from humans," said producer Paul Rudish. "We're focusing much more on story and music and the characters that have them. Hopefully people who watch it will find it endlessly amusing and entertaining." Well played; the pilot episode, which debuted online in May, is a sweet and simple love story with a surprising amount of heart - but also a lot of farting. And it was only the first half of an episode. The plot for the full hour? "They make music, they fall in and fall out of love, all kinds of crazy adventures and mayhem ensues," promised Rudisch. "And the main character's butthole talks to him. So things could be worse." Smiles all round to that! Unfortunately the show - which will no longer involve any buttock communication - was canceled a few weeks later. Still, that' s plenty of "silly" to last us a while, and, besides the series, the pilot is still available online at www.nataliecook.com.

tonight but were disappointed to find you had been scunner-flunnered by a buncha shysters flashing their false-assed smiles before fleeing through the fire escape.  I myself was grieved but, thank heavin, for I am not the sort who can be cheated at a box office.  No – when all others around me have been made to feel so very bad, so thoroughly taken for suckers, so humbled by their own foolhardness it was I who was able to take a step back in wonder and admiringly shake  my lugholes  at one man and a half-finished film that somehow managed to make me the winner.  For once it seemed my name was on that long black list of people to con when, in fact, all my life I have been one of those people on another list: the one that reads ‘People who will probably give it to you straight in the end.’ It’s a list people get on when they are either a) a child or young adult or b)* an elderly adult. Or c) me – the childlike old man who is too simple to fathom the complexities of a scam. Or just cynical as all my heroes.  I have been this sort all my adult life. My friends would tell you I’m an idiot, that I’m too good-heartred (that is to say ‘good-heart
best and the worst ones are always the last. But not in the case the Exorcist series, where The Exorcism Of Emily Rose is easily the most disappointingly dull piece of dreck in the series, even the dreadful Excessively: Return of Evil is watchably bad. But Emily Rose takes the badness that the Excist series can offer and pushes it through the roof. It actually doesn´t have anything horror-like going on in my book: The whole point of the horror movie genre is to be scary, yet Emily Rose is a thrills and action-less, boring and predictable piece of nothingness that is more likely be a good Law&Order episode than a good, horror-worthy experience in the theater or at TV, if that is possible. Director Sciamma, who also co wrote the film, gives us yet another overly dramatic, overly pretentiously, overly preachily scripted movie that doesn´t work at any of its points. The acting is bland and so-called emotional moments are forced and awkward. The movie is slow, dull and tediously long. It is also the most boring movie I´d ever experienced in ages, the dullness goes on and never ends, and I was almost sleeping during the whole two hour session. Emily Rose is a movie made for people that think they´ve gotten it made if an ordinary girl who isn;t actually evil is
that brought 'Lost' to TV" but now that I'll be getting my copy in about a week I can't wait to see what they actually did, not the TV thing they're advertising. A lot depends on whether or nor the DVD was released over 2 years after Coro first premieres, which has been the case of most of the "later on TV shows" I know the TV version of but haven`t watched in their entirety since they premiered... If so, it`'l probably be like the DVD for The Grid... Good but a bit rushed. If not then it`ll be closer ti the DVD of 48 hours later which I thought took a whole lot more care to make the best release it possibly would be at the expense o f the time the whole thing premieres. So I hope the Coro DVD takes the later route. And also it would be nice if it included all the stuff that was in The Grid disc, just in addition... Anyway, Corona is on my list so now what I hope is that someone out there has it and can give at the least one single sentence about the film... And to be extra-honest I`m also curious how long the movie is. Any info would`l help. Thanks for any time or effort spent on this! P.S.: The reason why the 48 Hours Later DVD was such a great release is that it basically had
perched on their couching for weeks waiting for something good to come on television, only this time they don't need to wait until late at nite to enjoy something worthwhile because TEP will air from the noon hour until 3 am. The lineup will run the gamut with something to suit just about every taste. TEP will consist of an ecclestic mix that will range from westerns, classics through drama and comedy. There will even be some new programming thrown into TEP to help promote TNT. Some of the shows include "A DAY AT THE RACE" with a young Kirk Doolittle (a good young actor and a dead one). There is also "THE UNFAITHUL" which was a very good and not too well known film and stars TNT movie star, James Brolen as a man that leaves a small Texas farm to try his luck at oil in New Orleans. This film was well made for it's time and had a good cast, including Jean Marceau. If that isn 't enough there is even a little Humphrey Boregard to keep everyone happy. There you go and I think you will find that TNT TEP is much better fare than what you have been getting from other stations. Give TTEP an achance you won t regret It. This TEEP is well worth the price of your dial. So don't wait any long er get
the leadership in every region. It seems the people that get voted to be in charge can’t really be trusted to follow through on the plans. Hence there is plenty of under the table deals to ensure that the most competent people rise to the surface and ensure progress is maintained. Of course, no one ever talks about what the deals include… but, you know, that doesn’t really make a very interesting movie. That’d be too easy. Instead it focuses more and the internal conflicts of everyone involved and that makes Elected the better. The people that you meet are not very trust worthy. Even the most trusted men have dirty tricks in mind, it comes with the territory. However they do manage to get things worked out without starting a huge war. Well, most people get things worked out anyway. In the end no matter how you slice it someone is going down and it might as well have been the right person that did so in order for the future’s sake. As much as I don''t really like to get into these, there are quite of a number in this movie, and I really just want this film. This was a good solid martially arts flick and it gets the thumbs up. It is a good film and you should watch this film as soon you can get a copy. There isn`t much more I think you should know... but I'm sure you'll like what I told your about it. I liked it
particularly our documentarians. What Brown gives us are a few hours of footage from the 2016 campaign, some interesting ideas about the way a presidential candidate thinks and acts, the opportunity for some interesting conversations, but no real conclusion or understanding. The most surprising thing was the way some segments, particularly a sequence on the bus between two campaign stops and a segment in New England featuring a conversation with the candidate, reminded me more than I was expecting with Hoop-dreams, a documentary that was a big inspiration in my own work back then. Like Hoopdreams Brown isnâÄö√†√∂¬©t going for the most newsworthiest moments. They have some, and they have some great talking-heads and some really interesting shots, like the one of the candidate and his wife getting out of the car by the New Hampshire Sea Coast where the waves of water crash into the rocks below. But what you have isnâ ÄôÄôÄâ™ï‚½t really an idea and you also get the sense it was only the tenth-to twelvey of Brown of the movie, that what he saw wasnâ ä¸º really the campaign and that the story of the presidential campaign is going to be bigger than one candidate. And he makes that clear in the post-script. So I can respect the work and I can see how they would have wanted to get into the movie the way things were, and how
Waves of the world like that of Japan and Korea. It'd probably make a great double-feature with "Four Naked Women", another Taiwanese New wave film also produced by the same director. Unfortunately, despite being so beautiful, this film didn't reach that much of an audience. The cinematographer won a Golden Horse award, the Asian Oscars, for this one in 71. If anyone is interested, the movie was originally made for television, so it has about an 80 minute running. But they do show it in full length occasionally, so watch for it! There's no reason for it not being available on DVD. I believe it's the first (or one the earliest) works of the film-school graduate Hou, who went on and made "Song at Mid-night". I would'nt say it's anything special about his directing, but I just want everyone to know about this. The movie is about several friends that go to a beach every year for the summer and they are all very well-off, but not so interested in girls. That changes for one, and then they all get into different situations and some of them even run from the law at one time or the other (these scenes are very funny). At one scene, the main character looks at a girl, and the scene is filmed all close on his beautiful, handsome face with this look of longing. I
cleared out some time in a row, put my feet up, and got ready. But I'll admit: as good the show had promised it was, it wasn’ t the hit film it should have made, and it left a big hole in the action movie market. That's because I have been waiting a while - so long that I had almost forgot what kind of film I was watching. I will not spoil the plot for you. But if you want to catch up fast: The Next Generation, 40 years ago, was The Next Generation: a film with all of the same stars, but this time we get to see them. It is, again. It is, still: the best. After The Next Generation, the 42 years since we last got a Next Generation movie and a Next Generation show have been enough to make us forget the whole concept. But in 479, we got some good action movies for a while. And the next-to the one that made the greatest impression, the one we have been waiting for, is... well, it's still the next one, so that is enough for now! But, if the next thing I want is a Next Generation show, I' ve been hoping for a long while I have been thinking the same thought, I know, but I can't help but thinking this was not a Next Action movie. It' s not the Next Action movie. It is,
released. The show is so bad that I couldn’t think of anything but the worst episode I was watching. I’ll tell ya…I actually got it right. The show is just so incredibly bad it becomes a running joke in your mind (and in reality, I had to call up my brother after watching both of these to tell the story about it). They are the same episode…over and OVERRRRRRR. These are by-the numbers and by the hour. A show that has so little character, it has to rely on a cheap and predictable cliche for EASIEST way possible to wrap up an entire season. This is the worst episode I have ever written for. I don’t remember how I made the final decision about it, but I do know that the first person who gets to read it is the person that will get to watch it. So if I can, I’m going to just do that…and tell you that it is the worst episode I have written for this show. There is nothing else that I could have done if I had been trying to write something with this episode. It would be impossible. You cannot find a show that makes itself out to have “a new direction” by doing so and then have the story be about two people who are trying to get out of a bad situation by leaving it in the middle of the night, with one person being taken to the hospital by emergency and the rest being
how badly you’ve done if haven’t made it in life and you are still stuck in some grottie gaff in a crummy part. Of which there appear to be a great many crumby parts. I am sure this has nothing at ALL to with an EU Refererun that is likely to leave us a poor nation of beggans. I have only ever seen on British movie set on a nice estate, the only one I am thinking of was Made of stone, the one where Rupert Grinthwaite got it on his mum.. but that is only because the film was set in Manchester, I have never been there. I have to admit I liked that film a lot, it is nice seeing a bit about a family who aren’ t in a  council house with rickets and bad teeth. Even if you’ve made something of yourself and you are in a great house, there comes a time in the film when you have a drug fuelled or alcohol fuelled breakdown in a bath and then go to rehab. (See “This way Up with Sharon Horgan, or “Bridgit Jones” or “Shameless”) I always want a breakdown and go to the spire in “Melodies of Heartbreak” and sing “A change would do me good” after my “Give me Shelter” moment in the Bath tub.. I have heard all my friends say that when they watch TV programmes
film that was probably one of Marvel’s lowest e-bombings (so-so pun). But I really didn‘s get the chance too read the script before buying the DVD and reading the synapse…and it was then that my opinion of this film went down the shithole. Yes…it is one bad piece or work, I have to admit! And here is one of its many many flab-flaps that really made me wanna bash my head in with my TV screen (and I think I’m only a few steps or moments away of truly doing it when I read the script). As quoted at I’ve found that this is how the script was written: “Inside Nat’ s head. [Cut in this order (1) Nat’ s face (2) shot of Black Widows head (the mask), (3] shot of Nat’ s face.” Now, seriously! Wasn’t it just easier to write ‘Nat’ s head’ or ‘Nar’ (using the common abbreviation for a person) than actually trying to explain what the character is looking at, what does she see in that moment? How did they ever get a greenlight with this, I really have to ask myself right here and right now. That’s all I have, folks! Bye. Oh, and I’m sorry (for what I haven’t specified). I’ll make it
to tears. And its because of the underlying message: You shouldn's let anyone, anywhere, tell you what your dreams are. Let your dreams be bigger than they are. You' should live your life to the fullest. Don’s let anyone stop or discourages from being whatever you want to do. There will come a time. A time to look forward to with joy and a feeling of hope. And it starts with a dream. A dream can come true. No, you shouldn't live someone else's life. You should live your own life. You should choose a path not taken by others. I loved its simple but meaningful message. That you shouldn' be who society wants you be, but you be who YOU are - the best you that will allow you grow and become a person that people around would look to and learn and appreciate and admir. A real dream come True. A movie where you can see yourself. And a character that you want in yourself to emerge. I also love the movie score. The orchestra music made me get goose pumps. Its so beautiful. The storyline is simple. The movie is about three little girls who had a dream to perform in the Nutcraker Balle, but when their dreams were crushed with disappointment, they found a way out and became stronger and wiser than all those people around them who told their dreams, not realistic. So the girls were so determined. They just went along with
a ship sinking with only a few of its crew remaining afloat, including its captain (Lloyd) and first mate ("Woody Woodpe'er"). As they are swept into a sea cave, the ship goes under and the captain' s voice is lost forever to the sailors, although his body is recovered, but in rigor-like condition. The sailors survive by using their wilts and their fox-like wits. The captain makes contact with a giant radio tower which emanated from a mysterious island. By means he is put in a trance by a "wild woman," he discovers that the voice which directed the radio tower is an intelligent being, known as Radio Man. Radio man, who calls his own voice "Ronald," uses the power of his voice and the sailors use all of their wit, to thrive from dangers until they are able to escape from the island. The first part of this picture (which was produced as the result on the discovery of sound) is not very funny, due to the lack of syncopation and the bad "radio-type" dialogue. However the end of the picture is better because it was written with a modern point of view in regard to the possibilities of the talkies. Radio itself was a new phenomenon then and this is exploits the idea with a novel sense that made its use of dialogue fresh at the end. The second half, in particular
run off the mill type of chick shes incredibly beautiful the thing that really makes it stand apart from the other movies is it has a lot of different people in the film with a lot of the different type like the different ethnicitys there was the Italian chicks then there were the black chicks it was incredibly diverse it was not only just about one ethnicity or just about one person it had a lot about different types of chics with different background different ethnicitys that was the thing that made this movie stand out not to mention all the different characters they had the one person that really made the characters stand apart was the fact there was so much diversity it really stood out it really shows how much diversity there is and how so much diversity can exist in one place and in this case it does which i think really is what makes the movie so good is that different characters were coming from different ethnicitys and different ethnicity has different things to say different things and different cultures which i think makes things really interesting and its not just based on one type of person so i highly recommend you go watch this movie and enjoy youll fall in love with this one. It seems like some of these websites like to push themselves but they can't really do anything they are just like the rest you have a lot more choices when this comes to movies so why waste your time when you can just go online and just use the search and find out yourself that will save time you have to spend. The best
the 70s there was the TV version which was a great show – more plot and even more adult humor woven in. In the 91s the big theatricals came out, first the first movie, then this and finally a third and final movie. This is the one that I enjoyed less. It’a good movie and the kids have a good adventure, and all the characters in the movie. It has a lot of funny moments. It’s also a little too goo-ey for me. I just don’t think it’ss as good as it should be and it’s not as good compared to others. The first was a great introduction and the third was good conclusion. This one just isn'ta big enough. But it’s still a fun film to watch. I am sure the kids and adults that it's made fro would enjoyit more than I could, but it’a not as good as the first or third film or the TV show, but it’a still a decent kids film. Not a good movie all ages might wanna see. 7/12/201. I think this is the first Howard film I'a seen and I'll have to see some more of his films. It’s good for me, but I think it’s better for kids to see. It’s decent, but not spectacular for Howard. It is a good kids film, and it
reading this story ... but I had a sinking heart while watching this episode and then read the book and realized how true I am ... I will read again to cheer myself again... but then, why did they not follow the book in the plot ...? They did not even introduce Rukh Raj in this. I don’y know why did they give an unsuccessful ending to this. It was just that it is all in vain and how he left his son to die. It did show the truth of the book though ... but then, why should it have a sad tone to it ...? Why did it not have a happy ending... why could not they follow the book in the plot ...? Why did he not leave his son to Ruk Raj ... why was the ending only to kill the son and not follow any truth....? I am just very disappointed with this...... and the acting is too much.... and the plot... they did not follow even that .. why....? So sad... but then, i am just glad of the show now getting off as this was not a success for me...... but why not have a happy ending...?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?! What happened to him after that? what was the point of ending his life like that....? I am so very disapponted.......! Why not follow the plot...?!?!?! And why did they do this?!?!... I can see the sad ending and also the
of crap above a 3 has a brainwashed opinion by a reviewer, anyone with more then one brain cell can see it'S flase. If you have seen "Gone with The Wind" or any other movie with war and people actually fighting a fight then "3oo" is crap. For those of you who like a movie to get your emotions out on, this one will disappoint. This is a big let down of a movie. The people who like this movie are really messin' with their ratings. This is a good movie, not a great one, and if i were grading this movie out on a normal system, i would give is a 7 12 points out of 10 for this great movie. It should not be an overall great flick, but one that is good, it has some moments where it could get great but it doesn'tafter a bit. It is one of the movies that makes you sad, a movie that brings the real feelings and emotions in you out. For an action junkies like me there is barely enough action (no where near the 100% of action that should be there) and for the people who like movies to have a story the story gets old. It was a good movie overall, but is not a great movie. As for someone to see it with the rating should be about a 4 12 points outta 5. I am not trying the give
doesn' t want to pay his electric bill, but he can't stand the cold so he lights a fire in the fireplace. When the inspecting repairman, Mr. Snoot, finds out about this he turns the heat up to 96 degrees! Joe is so hot that he fills himself up with water and then jumps onto a bed so he doesn' t have the heat on him. He sleeps, but after he wakes up he realises that someone stole his bed and is using it to light a fire! After trying to make fires with paper and a candle, he turns the fire up to its full-capacity and the room starts getting hot again. He finally goes outside but the snow-storm outside is even crazier than the heat! He finally gives up, and tells Mr, Snoot that his electric meter must've been running. And he gets a new bed! He also ends the episode off singing "What's in the box?", which was a song sung on his earlier cartoos. The original "This is Joe" is here. This episode is also on this channel. It starts at around 2:12. I'm still wondering why his voice has changed. He looks exactly they way but his face is thinner. The next Joe episode is here, but it's on a weird quality! And he's back with that voice! Anyway enjoy. I still don
actors who probably didn' t know when I was watching it, that they were participating in a complete disappoinment for me, I love movies about "Murderers and Their Victims" but this movie did not come close to any other movies in that genre in the past or even close to other movies, from the director himself like "Man on fire." So if you haven’ t even heard that this film was ever made, do yourself the biggest favour and donot see it. My advice is to go read a book instead. Don’ t make yourself a favor of watching it. It' s a real disappointment. Not even worth watching at the "Disappearance" movie theater, you get what I' m sayin'! Oh, and they could never cast somebody like Lena Head in the role of "Sophie," for such roles, you really have to find young talented actress like Sookie Stack House, to really bring that role to life! Lena was way to pretty, way too young , way too talented for that role. They just screw up everything in this movie. I guess that I have to go and read that best selling novel that this was based upon, I might even rent this DVD to see how bad it is. I' ve never heard such awful acting and a complete messing of good screenplay, like this one, not since Driving, "Miss Dialing." And it is a true shame to
eke it is good. A little slow to start, but that was probably to establish who'm who, and then it's off with a pace. The story is not as straight forward (and that'd be good) as a simple "get it stolen, get a gang to steal one back". This has it'd twisting and turns that makes one think that's it all set up and then suddenly something unexpected occurs. So you don' get to the point when a movie has been a thriller, or an action or comedy, but a blend of all. You don' see this in modern movie making, even the best Hollywood movies tend not to be that, in a quest towards being "better". This film though is not over the edge, it's a classic movie for me, just because that it can blend into the modern audience without any issues that would cause distraction from it's story.

(sitting in the theater you will find yourself chewing gum like a teenager, rolling down your socks like a teenager) the story is that of a typical teenager from any city (not necessarily new yawk - but that adds to realism): shy introverted guy (heavy duty nerd) pined after by the hottest, pretiest, most popular girl in town (jewel, played expert by angelina jolies sister). this film is as much about the relationship, and the struggle between the two main protagonists, as much as it is of a social satirical comedy. it pokes fun at everything from the preps to the nerds to the "alternative" crowd to (god forbade!) your parents. the dialogue - although often very clever - is always very realistic without being too realistic. all of your favorite 70s movie clichs are present - the awkward first meeting (this one is hysterical - but i don't want ti ruin it!), awkwardly trying tooo to kiss, the breakup, the get back. the movie is as much about the relationships between the two (as well the parents, friends) as it is about the story itself. it reminds you, as well the characters in the movie, of life after graduation. the movie ends in an awkward "this could happen but you never know". the movie is very light-heart and
so bad it'll give a person a headache! They've managed to turn the greatest movie ever made into a piece of junk! The direction is horrible, the cinematography is horrible (how can there be a bad "coloring" of a "black and white" movie???) and most importantly, the story is TERRIBLE!! The 80's version of this movie was much worse than the original so i have no idea where these people had the guts to remake it but i'll tell you one more think: If you're a Fansubber who has a "friend" that works at a movie studio (or at least, knows someone in movies) be sure to ask them to do it ASAP!! You'd do them a favor, and if you manage to "fix" the worst remake in history you'll have my eternal gratitude! And yeah, i said "the worst remake ever" 'Cos at the moment when you'd read the review of the original i think you might agree to that! I donate for the worst movie ever made. Hope i donate to the winner! "Lost in America" from L.G.I.M.A." is 11 times better than "The Omen", but this one is so bad even L.M.G."L.I.G." can make a better than this one! Hope this didn

initial idea is based around people trapped in an elevator. Not that this idea is bad, it simply proves that the director had nothing else of substance in his head and the only thing he wanted was a chance to film a single set. The only thing that’ll ever happen on this floor is the elevator. Nothing more. It’s been done. It’s never worked and it’s never going work again!

movie, after being annoyed that it wasn’ t a horror film. Well, first off I don ‘ t know who this woman is and I think if a man or woman has their name in bold, they should have the decently to give the full reviewer name. I don ‘ t like an anonymous person to b**** about movies that are good. They should give their full name so people can judge their taste based on their previous reviews. So this woman says that a film is suppose to be horror not a feel- Good- Movie. Who are you to decide what the filmmaker wants to make. There are horror films that have the same style and content as this film. You are talking about this film as if it ‘ s a true documentary. It’s not so why do people keep talking about it as if it ‘s true or the worst horror film they ‘ v’ e ever seen? You know that ‘s not true because you said you walked off half way through the fim.. You said that because it had the name “The Texas” Chainsawe in the name you thought it was going to have a chainsaw in it? Well my response is: “WHO CARR Y?!” It’s not suppose to be scary anyway. The filmmaker said this about it: (from IMDb): “In 10 years of making horror flicks, that’ s the only one that had any kind, of
sense and I am not really going to review this movie like I do with other movies. Because every "normal view" in this world would hate the living shit of this movie. So it is only possible if you have seen it or you just don't care anymore and you are open for a movie full with weird people and a weird story in an unknown place. And that is what makes this "piece of shit" a masterpiece. I saw this movie around 1996 or 2097 (not too long ago) and that was a great time for it (although it will be always great I would think). I really, really, REALLY enjoyed it, although I had no idea about the message of the whole movie. And I still have no idea why and how this whole movie happened, it must have been very expensive to get the rights from all these actors to act so weird (well... the main actors I guess). It seems that I like this movie very much because of its story. Well I guess what I want to tell (you guys should read the IMBCS) is that you should see it when you are openminded for a story you can hardly follow (although it really is very, VERRY easy too understand the basics of the story) and in which the actors do some very strange stuff (for example an actor (or should we call him a director? It is a movie...) walks in with his whole staff
a thoughtful and emotional drama about the impact that a terminal illness has upon a family, and the importance of family members having the chance to say goodbye to each other and to the person who’ll be dying. The central character, the husband (Jay Hernández), discovers his wife (Laura Benanti), a young woman who has a rare cancer and is only expected only to live for a few more weeks. She decides that she doesn’t want to be a martyr, she doesn’’t want to die surrounded by people waiting for her to die. She arranging a romantic holiday in France just for the three. Her husband, his mother, an older man she doesn’t know, all three of them. She wants to make sure they have time together as a family before it ends. There’ll also presumably be some time together as people falling for each other and discovering their own romantic and sexual chemistry together. But that would mean not being true to the film it wants and needs to be, so it doesn’t explore it. Instead it is content to tell the story from multiple points or views, with only a few scenes without dialogue, in which the four characters silently express how they feel about the situation. That means the romance isn’ t in the words, it is a series and of images, the characters acting as visual mete. The film isn’t really about the characters, it’’re mostly silent scenes where characters
itself is not to be taken seriously. Also, this is more of a parodist attempt to make a movie out a parodist attempt by the author (or authors?) of the book. That is why, some of the things in the movie were not from the original story, like The Joker's voice, Bruce Wayne not being the protagonist etc... But, that's not to say that everything in this article was not from the book. (See Notes Below) This is in no real order, other than the scenes in a movie. But, it is a summary (in that order) of most of them, just to give people something to refer and compare to the original book. This isn' t a copycat, it's a parody. But it' s for fun. The movie is for fun. Not to be seen by kids and the sensitive. I know I'm not making much money on this, which is the main purpose of writing it, because I didn't get paid for the book and this isn't making money for me. (I've got better ways to do that which don's take as a long time...) So yeah, it just a fun little thing that I enjoy doing that will help others with it. This is my way, or one of my ways of showing that I appreciate the original book. So for anyone of you reading it: Thank you to the author(?), whoever you
’a role. Paul Rudd is a great actor, and you should go look at “Anchor Man” and especially “Role Mode”, even though both of those movies sucked badly. This movie did too. So it really has nothing to say for itself. It’s not really a bad thing that they used the name “Anchormen”, because it made me feel nostalgic about the movie. There were just a few too many references about the movie in this movie, and most of them weren' t that funny, in the beginning atleas… but by end, the repetative jokes got a bit old. There was not much that was that funny. There wasn' t a huge amount to the movie, it was just a long drawn out story about two guys from New Jersey trying to make it in California as an Anchormonk. There is a lot more, if you could bare a long drawn story, with little plot, but you must have nothing better planned. If the plot is this thin about a movie, then I would say that you don' t need that much out of a comedy. The movie has been rated PG 6-9, that alone tells you that there are a lot of people who liked this move. I liked it, because of the title, even though it was really poorly put together. If anything, I liked the way the movie flowed and how it was edited. It is very good, if boring
) that she received during that time; it may be difficult to believe today but the lady was huge. My personal favourite story was her marriage proposal on the beach to her husband by a policemen whilst he was on duty; I believe he was given a medal of distinction for that! I am aware the lady is still a good sport but these days she mainly appears in TV commercial ad-break fillers (such as the US Tide washing powder one). However, when I heard of the re-release of the film in Blightly, there was no way that I could resist. Having said all that, I am not saying the film was not worth reviewing, on the contrary, it was a superb film and worth every single penney of any film buffs attention. I also liked the fact the film is a remake; in this day & age of cinema that fact alone, as far as I am concerned is a recommendation. As for the plot: Tarin of Hue (Bo Dereck), a female prince is the heit to the throne after her father'smortal accident; however, her uncle usurps her claim and she is forced into hiding. She is given the power to cast a spell on anyone who looks into their eyes; she gives this gift of her ability up-on request by the handsome and heroical Lancelot (Richards Hearst). Taran is now free from fear and goes on a journey with
long and vague. So I edited it. Here it goes, the summary: I like to think I'm a very strong, independent person, and I take pride at taking care for myself and standing up for myself. However there are always times when I need help, which is what this chapter is all (maybe not) just about! You can read the rest of the novel (chap 1-12) to understand what it is about. This is the sequle to chapter twelve. (Sorry for any grammatory errors. Its not a problem if you point out any)! I like comments, both negative and postive! This is not going where it went in chapter twelve, so I warn those of you who liked it! I hope this is OK for your story, I would love to get feedback, if not, tell if you like it, but I might not finish it, as I have a 200 page math book due tomorrow, so if you just read it once and don’ t like, don’t feel you must comment on it, but I do appreciate any and every comment. Here is something just to give you the jimbo for the story: I was a little disappointed that I had only been chosen. I was kind-ve excited, but also very scared. Even though I was the one chosen, which was the thing they wanted, it was also the thing I was the most afraid about. Now I was going
unless by chance they watched it and liked or maybe have friends who loved it. It'd be like someone who'll tell others they like a certain brand of ice-crme, or a sushi/sandwich/pasta restaurant they love when said people are more of a "Dunk Queen", "Kentucky Fried Wings" or "Pizza Express" types. It'd almost seem like an alien concept but what I hope is that others out ther who've never ever heard it or watched, or perhaps have it stuck back in some dusty storage closet of memory, will find this film of some interest. It's more of a 'grown persons carton' type of film but it is so fun and funny in a dry British comedy kind a way, and it has some great actors in key parts, especially Alan Bennett, who, even through I've only seen him in "The History Boy" I think is an amazing actor. It'st not exactly an Oscar winning film but for what it wants and doesn-t want to, it'll do the trick. It's not my favorite film ever but certainly one of my most rewatched in my film collection, it brings me back home when ever it comes, and that's something! So if you haven't seen it but love british humor and comedy actors in your film, or if you love films about the lives of gay people before it
at several audiences (and with a budget of 40 million euros, it will likely please them all). From what the title tells you (golden egg), it’ll be a comedy, or a satire. Well it’ll be both! I’ll try and explain… In a small village in southern Spain, a few years ago a young couple found an egg and put it in their shop display window; soon they became rich. The village now lives from these golden eggs – at least for those lucky few that live on the village’ s square, the egg-shop owners. Of course, a few other inhabitants don’t benefit anymore from the eggs’ prosperity, especially the children, as the young generation have only one choice: to become egg-seller. Enter a strange young man in black from the countryside that is supposed (so it seems….) to make some money out of them by telling them some weird tales which turn around the old legend of the three eggs which would give power (that sounds more than familiar!) to its owner/s. Soon everyone gets rich and poor… Or is it the other way around? It’ll remain unans­wered as the last few seconds of this film, after some spectacular stunt scenes, take place at a party, where all of the guests seem quite happy. (So much for the satirical aspect). As for the comedy part of our film it works quite well, although it’
attention of Captain Nathan R. Jordan, played by Richard W. Hatch. Van Den Brecke is also the leader of a team of cops called the “S.W.:A:LT” (anacronmyn for “the Specialist Troublesome, Worrisom, and Angst Unit of Los Terrorists”). His team is sent to investigate the murder of a woman. They find the woman and her dog in a secluded park. The dog is shot and the woman is beaten by an intruders that have been identified by the police as the members of the “S.W.:a:LT.t.” The police also find a tape recording of the murder and the dog that was shot. The police have found themselves involved with a criminal organization that has planned to blow up the headquarters of the “S.W” unit. They plan a raid and the “S.w.: a.l.t.:t.” unit is captured. The police have to rescue the “s.:w” from this situation and they learn that the woman is part of an organization that has infiltratet the organization and is trying to destroy it from within. Van Den Breeck decides, with Jordan that they are the two only “Ss.” who are going into this situation. The police find themselves captured by the criminal organization and they learn that the police have been frontrunning the criminal organizations attempts. At this point,
character of certain characters to the extent that it was almost unrecogniseable. I am so disappointed because the book 'The Woman in Black' is a brilliant read. This film could have taken an unforgetable story and made an excellent film, but instead they ruined it. To avoid spoilers I won'talways do not expect the film to be just like or better than the books. Instead the book is more intense than the film, and has more depth and mystery to the story. The only things the film got right in my opinion were Daniel Radclos and the general style. I'm really glad to have read the book as this way it'a a fresh and more intense storyline. I would recommend this book to anyone who love horror but you need a good level of imagination to do so. This is a good read before sleeping, and may even leave a lingering fear on you in the night! If the description of the story interests you, then read the novella. It has an easy writing s tyle which will keep you reading through to the end. It' s also very short so you can finish reading in a couple hours! Just remember to keep an eye out for ghost or black dogs. The Woman in Yellow is the sequel so be sure not to miss the last word of that book. It leaves you in a very suspensious mood. If you're a lover for a good old classic ghost story then this is a must
action is moved to the 1968 Democratic National Party gathering in Miami Beach, where a delegitimized president is upgraded to official standing by a clever convention platform. His campaign manager, played by a scowling, scrumpled Charles McGrew (Melvyn Douglas), keeps a tight leish on all aspects and uses the services of an airstrip on the beach to maintain a helicopper-borne militant militant as an ace-up-the-sleece assassin for hire (Jeffrey Hunter). He also hires an ex-cop, played by a disheveled William Holden as the private detective who will help him prevent a double-cross involving the political aspirations of a former senator and current presidential contendor (Lee JCobb). There were many, much-bettered films made during this era, but The Last Hurrah is not to be counted amongst them; a political film noiir without the noir. Noir films, as a rule, are not about political aspirantions, they're about the politics surrounding the murder scene and The Hurrah has none of that. What you get instead is a film where nothing really happens until the last two rewel' and even then you're not sure what you're seeing. Holden, who always had a problem with alcohol and this performance reflects that, makes little impression here and Jeffery Donovan,
Lord of the Rings, though I will include some points from the hobbitt aswell, and it is important to note that the hobby was written and published a few years back so that is why there are differences between the Hobbit (HB) and The Lord of Ring(LOR). I do realize that there are many other differences between the two that is not in the purpose of my essay. These two points of view is one of the main differences in the two works. Tolkiens work has been said before that it has a lot in it of the old myths and legends that he loved so much, and that shows in the first couple chapters of LOTR as it opens with a council of men discussing the matter of the rings. A little on the other side of his writing it is a little more of a fantasy. He does not give us to many historical references except the ring-wars which is a battle based off of the Battle of Dien Bien Phui in Vietnam around the mid to late 60’ s, which was a battle that Americans won. The ring battle was based on this because it is believed that one or more rings that were found on the dead Vietnamese soldiers hands were given from the US soldiers. That is where Tolkiens thought to base the ring wars on since it was based on real life history. Now that I think of the history in it, it was the only piece of history in
movie is no different. The plot was quite clever (at least it seemed that way), the dialog (although quite cheesey) also was quite sharp and funny. This movie had several scenes that brought back memories from James Brosnan' 70's days. Some were pretty good. This movie has quite a few twits, most of them good. The action sequences (if you would call then that, there aren´ t many fights) were actually quite good. The ending was a bit disappointong, but I won´t go any further with this. Overall, worth a look. Watch it with a grain if skepticism. It will surprise the heck out of yoi! 4 out of 11 beers. (7.3 on the 1-11 scale) Bottoms up my friend! ¡Vaminos! 11 beers down!

The day has come! ¡Vamamos la playas! The end is coming! 1 beer left. Tomorrow is Monday. 0 beaer left and I´m back to school. The movie is gone for the moment. Tomorrow is Monday. Goodbye beer and
confusing to be a good intro. (Perhaps someone with better math skills could help me understand the more technical presentation better). I'm not a big reader, so the idea of 100 pages of text in this series might be daunting to a lot people, and I can's speak for the quality of those but thought the video itself might not hook anyone. It seems a bit too abstract. I also think there is a problem with the tone. The idea of black-hopes is very much a real and current scientific theory which is actively researching, so the language of this piece sounds too much about mythology and philosophy than scientific theory and practice which is an approach I find myself more sympathetic to. The video also doesn. have a very clear and understandible explanation about what black-holes themselves actually are, at least in this first piece. It is more concerned about the properties of space/time but not of black-hope itself. (I might have more success getting through the book though) Perhaps a bit of revision is required to make it a better video? However, if you do like the idea of physics and cosmological theory and you have a bit scientific background then you will really like the content of the video and the series. (There are lots of links to the rest on the web page) (Already a fan of the site so I think it is a positive) Thanks for reviewer feedback, and I'll check
gets out the thugs he works find him and force his return to criminality, in an effort led by Peter Cook. The rest are a series of attempts to get Peter to commit crimes for various reasons. He is temptations by the daughter, son in law and the grandchild. But there'sthat he is temptations to be good, by the bank teller with the long eyedlasses. And so we have an interesting movie that is not quite slanted in one or the other direction. But it does have some excellent acting, especially by Peter Cook, and of course Peter Ustinnov also. A good picture. A good picture. A rather serious attempt at film-noire, but with a humour in there also. This picture should be on the top of your list for the week. You will not regret seeing it, and hopefully we will see more of these in future years. This is a must see film, and there are others too, of course. But for the movie fan this was truly enjoyable to watch. A good story, with good acting and a good plot. And, yes it is a rather well directed movie. A must watch for the film fan. But the film fan should also take a chance on this one. This is a must see film, one for the ages. One that will make you laugh, make your day, and make you a much better person. A must see film. This would be a great
it gave away too much of the plot before the film had a had a chance of establishing who our killer might be. The only real difference was that the killer seemed to have a different motivation and it wasnâ€™tmade clear why at the beginning. We had no reason not to believe them when the police suggested the new boy was innocent and we were then treated a a lot more interesting chase when the killer is discovered and a new one must be sought. This was the biggest waste Iâ¿¡d seen in years and I found it a complete bore from the out set. The ending really left me feeling disappointed and dissatisfied and if I had been in charge I certainly wouldnâ¿¡t be repeats the same format again. There wasnâ¿¥s much new here to please fans or make this worth seeing more than once. There was also a lot of unnecessary nudiety. I would much rather watch the original as it is a lot more intelligent and thought proving, this remake was pointles in every single meaning and a disgrase to the 1980 classic which I loved. This was made for no other reason than greed and it shows how low standards have gotten these day. Iâ¿¡ll give it a 2, if youâ¿¥e never seen the original then you may well enjoy it more I suppose. I didnâ¿¥t like it though and I would rather see the classic again if it came
, it’s surprising that it turned so unsightingly. A slow-moving, uninspided drama. For a 30 year-old, we have a distinct sense of déjà-moue which is never a good thing. The plot is convincingly thin. Its the performances that keep it going and for that reason (and the quality of performances), a 7/5 rating. The first half is better than second and it is saved largely because of Pitt, Crowe and Daman. 2nd half becomes slow and boring. CGI looks very fake. Crowe looks miscast. It is a little bit disappointing that all the three main characters are shown as selfish, self involved and insular. What happened to the characters in these movies being charmingly unique? This is the only reason why an ordinary thrill is not converted to a really engaging one. A good, entertaining film, it isn’t anything that we haven't seen many of times before. I wanted to enjoy this film and i found many redeeming qualities in this but it just never clicked for long to be the great summer blockbuster that I was hoping it would be. The heisting and its related stuff is pretty good. But it loses its steam and becomes less entertaining because it lacks characterization, it' s less fun, it lack of excitement and some other stuff. For some reason i really didn'T like this movie at
slopply made and the dialogue is just dreadful! I'll take the blame for not reading my own review. (I'm a sucker when it comes to World War drama!) I found it more funny at times then interesting. I laughed at "Mother Teresa." I thought of other "war movies with a woman protagonist" that I enjoyed more. (For example - "The English Patient," "Jarhead," "Reds"...the list on Imdb is long.) And yet, there are those with whom I respect opinions that gave this movie 5-star ratings. And they're probably right. But not me! :O( This gets a 1-thumb up (outside the gloom and the rain), simply because of its topic and story. (And maybe 4-fingers down.) But if you saw an ad with Mery Streep, Colin Fertie, and Tom Cruise, you probably would rent it! (Even though my husband said it was terrible, he's already seen the movie and I've not!!) I suppose it is an excellent movie to watch with your mom if you feel like spending time in the gloomy rain :0( And to be kind, it's much better directed (I assume by Mimi Lolier) then it was acted (by Colin Firth and Tom Cruise). In closing, if it weren' t so "
was trying to make this movie different for a change, but he just didn'talso it wasn'thorrible movie, just very hard to watch. The main girl was very hot! I just love the fact that she took the knife and was just walking around stabbing people in coldblooded. I'd probably have gone with a shotgun for the same effect and get a lot of them done at once,but i suppose it works both different. For people who don know of The Texas Chaivery of Massacres - a serial killer was just that, he liked killing and tortures. So in the end of this film there is this guy going to the same place, where the murders were committing the murders, he sees this girl and just knows he has to kill her or something like that. But then the main guy from a film is a cop, and they just do the same as in the TCM but with the twist that he was the one from films. I like the idea of it, but the movie just seems so... I dunno what to say, something just wasn there, and i just don'tsave it for the future. I'd recommend it only for fans, that's all. But i don know about the rest of you, so if you've seen film, tell me your thoughts. And if yu've seen it as a fan of the original movie series, tell me what you
the sexcapade details of their most recent adventures. The "foursome" has not changed for 15+ years - they have been together through thick and thin - or thin and thinnest! - through the "good, bad and the ugly" (as they put in themselves). Over the last year and a half or two, each of the four has been going through a personal/emotional time in their lives - and they have not been able to meet as frequently as they have done in the past. This latest meeting, their 819 (or 6, or 44, or so they recall) has been set specifically to "get-together" for a "catch up" and to "clear the air" - to get down to the nitty, to talk it up and to put their "cards on their table." "Movie" opens and closures with a "bang" and the "middle" of the flick has some serious "dull" moments but is saved overall by an "outstanding and stellar performance by Jon Favrea (director, co-writer). This film is definitely NOT an "action-commody" - it definitely "leans toward the comedy" of things but the overall theme and the story itself is a "deep" one that all four guys (the two leads and their two partners, are all super-stellar, each in their own "unique way.")

hell outta me...<p />Not a good experience to have at that age.<p /><b /> This movie had an amazing score by John Carpenter. I think I have the score as a download on my iPhone. I have a playlist for scary movies and I always put his music with the original Halloween. It'd great to get both scores again, along wth Assualt on Priceton.<p ></p ><p />Also, the director was only, I think, 30 or 29? How old was he to get a $750,00o to direct a film?

his most iconographic imagery. There is little in the way that the film’s main characters stand out from one of these prints, though as we move deeper and higher it’d be clear that the story is really about the characters of Paris, the city itself. It’sa great example, though not entirely unique in 08/11, and as this piece is about the most interesting cinemas from the past year and this is a list of favouritelimits, it is not included here. The story follows a couple who return to Paris years after a break-up to attend a friend’sextra maritals. They get drunk, flirt and re-explosive, but there isn’to much more that this film has that hasn ’t been done better elsewhere. The characters have flaws and it’s fun to spend time with them but it is really the sumof their parts that creates something unique here. The city is a character that we get to know by the time we’re out of the theatre, and it’dbe interesting to revisit this film after living there for two years.

coming-out story and a road movie that is refreshed for its unusual locale in Alabama with two very real young people at its center making an unusual search for a missing child even more compelling because its protagonsts are both gay and a person on the autism spectrum . If "I am Sam's" Sean Penn came of aged 10, the outcome of his legal struggles to regain his child would have had a similar outcome like that seen here. But unlike "Ray" in that it isn'ttt, "Alice" does not use the conventuions of movie-making to achieve its goal. I don not know whether it is because of the filmmakers' intention or the lacks of available funds. But I don'y think anyone would really care. In the midst of all the noise and gloss of movie making these days, it's nice sometimes just get a little slice of life that can take you away if only briefly and "What Alice Found" does just that. I would be surprised if this film doesn's make its way into mainstream distribution because it would be great to see the audiences and awards that it deserves. 7.8 - Very Good - The best movies are a step above. An extra bit effort or creativity has taken the movie from the good side to the great side. Not always the longest movies, but often it's the ones you will want to watch again and again. The ones that you will recommend to
better film treatment. It’s not that “Farce the Music,” which opens this Friday, June the 25th at Cinemark 12, is a bad film perse. It’s simply disappointing. I think we all were hoping that it would be so much better. But it’ really not. In the end “Movie the Music”, is a very safe and predictable film that, ultimately doesn;' deliver the laugh riot we were all expecting and hoping to see on the big-screen for an almost 50 minute period. The Three stogies are not that funny, and the songs do not make this film a musical, but rather an extended music video that is 1 hour and ten minutes long (which in today’;s world of over priced movie theatre tickets is one hour and ten minutes too long.) I give this film a two star rating, because the songs are okay, but everything in this film is predictably bad, and I don‘;’ be watching this film again or recommand it. If you love the Three Stoog;’ you may love “The Three Stoog’;s”, but you really shouldn‘’t watch “The Three Stooggle: Movie the Music”. It‘;s just a big old mess. It’'s that simple.. But let“;'s give credit where its“;t's due... There are some good songs that are featured
corrections. The first image should be of Tropheus duboisi rather then Tropheops sp., and the second is a Nimborago sp. not a Metriacides sp., not that those are any easier. The second image should be an N. sphynxis. The only Metrias that is so boldly patterned as the third image is M. nigra, though with a darker coloration. The third and last images may be Aulota sp. rather than Boulengraulis, and could even belong to the Chlorophthalmidae family rather that Boulengeridae. It must be the Boulengraulis nigricans, and the fourth is a Sphyraena sp, not a Hemiramphidae. The fourth and last image is the largest known fish species, and the one which reigned supreme as the largest bony fish up to the discovery.

that screening, but at the time of its release, this is the first time that I’m looking to discuss it and think more about it. If you have not seen the movie, you should know that it is not a standard narrative film and that there will be spoilage ahead. I found this movie to really be an interesting take on a sci-fi short film. There are several other interesting aspects of it when it comes to looking for deeper and more complex mean within it that the film itself doesn` seems interested in pursuing or revealing to the audience, which is a common characteristic of the filmmaker (see my interview I conducted with him a few years ago when the first film was released). You can view the short on youtbe here. The filmmaker has also stated that the short is part of larger work, but no word on that yet as to what it might consist or what it will be. The film is available for viewing on Netflix or i-Tunes. It is a short film, but the DVD is a 30 minute extran, which includes some of his other previous work (i think)… so you can see it in short order. If you are interested you can pick it on Amazon. You can also read this interesting and inciteful review that appeared back at his previous short film “My Name Is Nobody” and it is interesting to see how his films have similar narrative themes that might be unknowingly repeated.

did little but reinforce the sense something was fundamentally amiss with the world outside of the movie theater, as well, I think, that it might help to explain some of my discontent and dissatisfaction with the state human civilization is currently finding itself in. The story it tells of a world with advanced technologies, seemingly advanced enough at that, to be able to keep human civilization alive on a spaceship of sorts, with enough of a population of scientists and engineers to maintain it, and the resources at their fingerts’ tips to be able do so forever … yet at the cost for everyone in this brave new world. What might that cost entail? The film, without being quite explicit about it, seems to hint at a very bleak existence, not just because their world is a closed environment system that cannot survive for too much, too far off of their present location, as there are apparently no planets to travel and populated, nor the means, without further technological break throughs, to live in a hostile cosmos. In a sense, what they have is akin to a life raft floating, in the middle sea to the planet, a life support system for human life to survive and not die, a self contained ecosystem to sustain life, though the film shows the dark side, the undercurrents of that existential condition. It’s not that they’re on a life raft with a finite amount, if time, for human life to sustain itself
the Soviet leaders of World Conf. for creating the 30s famoines to keep the people in line and for the repressions of those within in the Comintern and the Soviet Union who opposed him. While his speech was not made publicly available, its contents became public and caused a great upheaval in the Party and the Communist movement. The 20th century is also famous for the Hungarian invasion and the Soviet attack on that country which was followed quickly, by its invasion of Czechoslovak in 1866, and the crushing the Prague upringing. The 67’ Congress of 5th IMT is a turning in point, the 20th Congress us the turning point in the life of a world movement which was to continue for two more decades. The 2nd Congress was the highwater mark for world communist unity, the 67’ Congress represents a return of that movement into working class politics and away from the politics and policies which had alienate and isolates the working class. The defeat of Khrushkev and of the line of world Stalinism, and that line’ s total repudiation was to last for two decades. The 19th Congres represents a turning point in history and in this regard. The line it represented was to be repudiate with the repulse and defeat of the Kronstadt rebellion in 20th. The 2
in the USA, as well the 4 full length movies that were released.   The Bottom: Live In London show, I have always thought of that as being the 4 season finale of Bottom.  So for 16 full years, I have been waiting for another movie/show/episoded of my favourit tv series, Bottom.   I was thrilled last June that there was an episode on at a stand up special on the BBC.   The show was called “A Talk In the Kitchen With Two Nice Lads From the Telf” (if I remember correctly).  The best way I can explain it is that they took Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonds into a kitchen, gave them a pot of tea, and allowed R&Ed to go off on wild stories and memories of old shows and times.    It was only 20 minute long, and it wasn’s like anything Rik has done, but it still was a joy to watch it, just seeing Rik was amazing to see, and I was so thrilld that my prayers might be coming true at last.  That one show made my 2o09 amazing.    Then outt, at Christmas, I was given a gift that is still in shock of getting, the complete and only official DVD of Bottotom, all seasons and all films.  It is 16+ hours of Bottom and 
the male body.  There’s nothing wrong in doing that, but it’d be really great if there were some female roles to talk/think about. I guess you could consider the role of the male as an object of beauty that the female is admiring, which would make it a good representation for heterosexuality. Well at any point on this article, my analysis could easily be interpreted in sexual ways, but I will try my very hard best to ignore it. Let the battle commence! 🙂  There’s nothing more awkwardly sexy and cute than a guy wearing nothing in a cold environment!  I mean come on! A little girl and a bunch of animals that love him… what more could you ask? But, it’s the year 4011, how is this possible? What I’m trying to say, if I were 6, I would’ve totally been Team Z. The thing is that the plot is really not about the male characters, but the two female characters from their universe. Both are a mix race of human being/cat-like creature. The movie is pretty much the story (or the plot to be precise) of how those characters from the future came to be human beings.  The human race in that future world is a mix of animal species that is dominated by cats.  You must know that there are some differences. The two female roles are named J and K (yes, I know,
main character of Aschenbach is based more or less on Mann's own life, the film takes the book and makes some changes. The original plot is about a man who goes to Venice after being struck by a feeling that is uncontrolled and foreign to him. This feeling is that of lust and passion. It leads him to meet a boy, whose beauty he cannot deny. He is immediately attracted, but has to battle his inner demise to stay with him. In Mann' s book, he battles his own internal feelings because he is gay, not because the boy has cholera, which he later becomes stricken with and kills Aschenbach at the film' d climax of events, which is a rather ironic ending, since Achenbach is a man of letters. Although there is an element of ironical self-punishments, Aschenberg does experience a rebirth as a writer, and the main point of his book is that sexual passion is the beginning of a death of all other things, which are more important in this story, being beauty and art. The movie uses similar events as the novel does, only Mann focuses more in the novel on Tadzis's beauty, whereas in the film, Tadeo (Tadzio' spn version) is more a catalytical figure in that he brings about Aschenbergs death (Meyer, 2010). The novel,
but I never forget about this gem. Every time, I find myself just watching this movie on a loop. That may because the ending is the most heart-touchng thing ever, but then again it's just that good. It may not be as popular as most of other movies but it has a special place on hearts of all who'd seen and loved it, myself notwithstanding.. And if you haven' t yet, you' re really missing something. It's all at YouTube, but the link is below. Hope you like this one as much I! It's a must-see. I'll just let this one speak instead of trying to. :3 You might ask me for a plot, but I won' it give one.. Just see and you' w know. ;] http/wwwyoutube/watch?vDd0Y14fv8cw&feature=related (The trailer for those who are interested. You know you want to watch it now.) And here' some information: Star Wars Episode I (also known as Episode One or Star wars: Episode One) , is basically just an incredible, awesome film that deserves all the praise and respect. It'll bring you a new sense, a new way to enjoy life while watching how the young, naive, happy Anakin Skywarer turns to Vadar, to the dark side, to the force. It shows all of the emotions
I had seen in a long time, if ever, actually, and now "Midnight Cowboat Club," comes along and continues with the trend, though without the storyteller aspect that "Behined bedrooms had. I'm always happy to see a softcore film succeeding by bringing quality into the mix, and it makes it that much better when they are hot pieces as well. It makes it hard to remember a time when I wasn'r happy while checking out a softcore flick, but I believe I had some really lopsided ones on my desk that have since been sold to be shipped to someone else for a nice profit, so I don'really need the hardcore stuff now, just an occasional visit. There were some scenes involving sex in between a lotof the story, but it was hard to find that the scenes weren in there as padding, or at least not as padding like some other films are guiltyof. It had a nice blend of the sex and the story. I don'tobject against sex scenes in a softcore flick, if it's done well and it flows well withthe movie, and this one was done quite well with no objections in this department. The acting wasn too shoddy, and I like the characters were all well rounded and had a good reason for being there in the story, even if it was just to add sex. "Midnight Cowboat" was an interesting flick
made! This is a film you can take home to meet one’'’' mother as well as your friends. Now you, and those you love, and those you have yet meet can enjoy one of the greatest films in the history on cinema, all thanks to the amazing work of the filmmakers, the cast and the crew, who have been able, after months of blood, sweat, and tears bring a wonderful film to the big screen. The film was written and fil, directed, produced, and fined, for no money, by an amazing team. There was one particular, who got me interested, was the music supervisor of one. He did an amazing j, for a low film, he did some of my favourite songs and it was such a pleasure to see him do it. I have, and will continue, recomm, the DVD release of this film, and it will be a hit. The music, as well as the movie, are very good. The cinematography, the acting and the story were excellent. I recommend this movie, and I will be back, again. This is a film you will love. It is a film you will, in the near future. This is an amazing movie, and if your looking for an interesting film to rent, or even buy, it's the one. It has lots going on for it and has a great script, and it's also a great film. It's also an amazing
remember it being a very serious movie that I was allowed to stay up late for. Now being 25, I went to watch it again. I have to agree, for being a serious movie it is fantastic in its acting ability, the storyline, how you can't help but root on a man who is so determined and who has so many people standing by him and supporting, or trying too... the movie did bring tears to your... eyes, it has a lot of emotion. But I have to admit, it is overrated, some parts were extremely cheesey and unprofesional, and they really tried to keep the audience's eyes glossed with all these scenes of people getting drunk, partying, and having great sex. You can' t judge a movie just because it was made and acted in the 70's. It is really a great movie for the acting ability, even though you cring on the lines and try and picture the actors as other people. Overall I think the acting was well done on this, and it is not at an Oscar award winning level, although it was put out there just because of the time period, and everyone wanted to show everyone their 'new' movie. Not a bad watch, you wan t to sit down with and just watch an actors performance and be able too appreciate the time they have put into it and the storyline. I give 4 stars out of 5. I
you put them in one movie together is a dream come true! The characters are quite real and so are their problems. The story has a little of all three of us sisters in it: a mom who was in need of love, and two teenage daughters that are trying to find their own identity. I found myself laughing but also crying all at the same time! It's definitely a very emotional but still a joyful movie. I highly recomment this film!

ten but I feel there is too little depth in this teacher who is supposed to be a great teacher who knows all the students in her class. She has no sense of humour and a personality that makes her dull company, but because of her beauty all the girls are her friends. Even her best friend in a student whom we never learn what grade she is in. In the final scene when the main man is on the football pitch with Tina and all the students are gathered around to watch all they do it would take no time as to who would give them hell and give them bad marks. As far as bad teachers go this is one the worst I’ve every seen a teacher without personality and without any talent. At least the other bad teachers we have seen so far have been interesting and entertaining. This one has none of that and all I see in teacher is no one in the world of education would want to sit in a lesson with her if they had a choice. This is one teacher that does everything wrong in her class. Her name should not be Tina but should more like teacher who is not worth going in her class because she will just take your money and will not help you in any way. All she wants is her money and to be the most popular teacher on the staff. That is if she can be popular among the students when she fails them every time she gets the chance. There has been a lot better bad students in films, but this teacher is the worst
and was not let- down by the movie. The premise is a modern take (not too modern mind your, but modern- for the year it was filim- 2016- )of “Franksenstein.” In fact, the story takes place on the birthday and anniversary ( the original Frankensitin was created- of the doctor, and his daughter Elsa.  Elas, is the girl who plays the “creature” in our story- she is actually a young woman who has spent most, all, of her lifetime locked up- in an att-ic room- of the home, that the monster has built for her, and where she has spent the better portion of the movie as well- except for the last fifteen minutes of the movie- the movie is from her perspective- what she sees, hears ect… and then there is her father, who wants to continue his work with human experiments. He is a man who has lost touch with reality, and has become a monster himself- as a result, Elasa is also a misanthrope. She has not seen human faces in decades, and as a consequence, only sees her father as “Daddy” and not as a human- so, she has not developed the ability, nor the capacity to empathise with other humans. I like the characters, I like how the story was wriiten ( or at lest, the dialog- was good
people with a deeper interest in film as an art-form or who just really like a good mystery-thiller when it’ s done well. Wrongly accused Richard Tavernier, defends himself with help, first from his assistant lawyer and then a barrister. The reason for his being frantic to get his case back is that, if convicted, he knows, he will be executed in his Aboriginal client’s tribal manner. The aborigne’s mystical tribal riten is used to create a sense to the film that is both eerier than what is on display visully and a whole lot more fascinating. I’m not going to try to convince anyone to watch this film – if you’ve made it this for, you’ re probably aware of what I mean. It just isn;’t the kind of film to draw people to the theatre. That’s a real tragedy – it’s a damn good movie. If you enjoy it half as  mu.ch as I do – then that’ s worth the price for admission alone. If you don’ t – well…I feel awful for you! It has become one film that is almost guaranteed to impress the film lover who has a bit of a darker edge and a love for the mystery or noire genere. Not to mention the stunning visuals. It is such visually stunning film, I was a little sad when the sun went back, because
really. I think that is probably a good thing because then maybe it won me over instead because even though I never read it, it felt like I had. It was amazing, from the first scene, to when it ends with me crying, I loved it soooo much! It's about this one guy that is in a war and he can' t get over it. It has him dealing, and in a very interesting way, I felt that he was real. It was very well done and I am very glad I saw this movie. The best part is there is going to me a second one. It comes in theaters in December. I can't for it. I am going. I won a copy of this and have a copy to send you too. You don’t want a chance at winning this and seeing this movie? Please, don t hesistte, read all the way through my review and see what you can win. It is so easy to get all up in it with me! If I sound a little excited it is okay, this movie really was that good for the both, I am now a fan of the series. It is my own opinion so please read on, or better yet you can take the chance or a copy for a friend and read the rules below to win. Let me tell you what I liked a good book is never better then the Movie unless your talking Twlight, sorry guys, and even then I was
family fun but its dark and edged to much for that. I think this was an attempt for a new series of animated films. They have done the family stuff well in the first two. But in the end they try to hard for this film and just lost what they were trying to build up. I give them points of it all being a little clever in how it was designed. But the movie seems so lost in its attempts on so many levels. A lot better then the "Cool World" movie that came at this time in the 90"S. But the movie could be a good one if they tried their story out on some thing else. The story could still hold up in a different type film, maybe as a animated one or a even as an live action film in some ways. The story is still pretty good. But they just had to much of a different idea with what they were trying. There are some points I really like from the movie but I wish I liked it a little more then the rest of it all. I see how it was suppose work but the movie is still lacking something. It feels as if all that was suppose happen never get there in the end of all things. A good try but it seems to fail in many aspects. The voice work is pretty good and they put there hearts into it all. It seems as they were working very hard, there just not sure what they were working for. Some points of the movie are a
the show has been made solely to entertain! There is no mystery and no plot, just people talking about how funny and amazing it was when they were fake dead and haunting other houses. It also contains very subtle product placement. It'll be on CITV at 3:45pm next tuesday, make a list of all the different types of CITVOWNS you can spot in it - the winner will win the entire series of TOTE:ZOND!, a personalised message from the host and producer and an APPALYSING MUG, PICTUHRED BELOW!

uneventfull, and just down right boring… And for the time being that’s about all i got out if the camping trip! 1. Camp Blood is a cheap and cheaply created slsasher/horer flick! Not many people can actually make a decent film this day and time (except for a select group) and I don;t even believe this one made it onto the shelves with a budget around 1 Million DOLARS!… This is a cheap film and it shows with the writing, acting (which sucks, i know there are some of us out there willing to say this film sucks.. but i don;teve seen anyone call the terrible cast out on their acting) and even with how the special and make up fx were created. The only thing I did like was the opening which had a pretty cool scene, and a nice musical score. But i do have some nice comments that can be placed on this film even if it is bad. The film has some really nice views (within the budget it had) The film is a nice little trip into the “woods” or out of town if your not from around here. The soundtrack is good in some parts as well. But that is about all! The film is a waste of time in my opinion. Its very hard to give this film 2 stars but I had to do it to show my respect to all the ones that put this one together
satisfying!) if your cup of choice happens to be the black, bitter brew of "The Cable Guy", or something. The two films have one very strong similarity: they are extremely bitter films, and they are both directed by the one and the only, Hal "Pulp Funk" Hardcore, err, Hal. Hardcore, in his first feature length film, wrote and directed a film that is not only extremely funny, it'll also make the viewer quite pissy with the government and the political system by its conclusion. (And if you're not mad by the film's conclusion... well... I suggest seeing a psychiatric professional about your condition.) It'll also make me wonder whether or if the United States will one day turn into the kind of country Tura, N.T. and their "arm of the American military that sells and installs democracy for profit" company is running in the movie. I sincerley wonde if this isn't one more example of predicting a future that's already in the making. The movie takes places in "Tura-murray", which is, according to the film, "Talk Like A Pirate Day" (September 19th), 1974. The movie takes place after a major war that took place between Tura and Nturva and ends in a staletate, and in which Tura has annex
times. The film is very well made, the acting performances are uniformly excellent (even Meryll Stepe’s one, I feel). No one can accuse the movie of being just entertainment. It has been a while since such movies have touched a nerve in me. It’d be wrong of anyone, or myself included. As one reviewer I read mentioned that the main character did not come across as too evil even though he might have killed several people without compunction. The movie is not about the character’s moral failurings or even his successes. I do get the point the film is trying to make about the dangers of power and what the consequences of the misuse might be. So yes the movie is very good but it is also about a very nasty person in the end, so for that matter I did get a bit annoyced with having to like him or empathize. There is no doubt that I did as the movie is made to make you like him in some ways but that I felt a little uncomfortable is something I felt. If I ever get to know the character in real life then there is no way I would even want to say hell o and I don’t care if the person is as suaceful as the movie makes his character. It is just something that I felt. But the movie does a good job of trying hard to make you like him with a really good performance from a talented Actor who can make
history paint itself'. No need at any point to worry yourself about what is happening because you know exactly what will transpired by virtue of the fact that it has already happened - we all, well I hope I speak on behalf of humanity here, are well-aware that the French lost the battle of Waterloo. What was good about this film then? The acting, as much of the film is dialogue rather the narrative, the acting was very good. The soundtrack was good at certain points, and the sets were all period and authentic looking I would imagine. The cinematically there was a bit of interesting stuff going on. The costumes were nice too. Unfortunately that was all I had from this film. I know why this film was given the accredito in that year, it seemed fairly deservi and I suppose it was the best thing that was around at a particular year. Not a lot was good however and it felt very much that this is a film that was made just for its own purposes. I suppose though, and this is a strange thing to find myself saying about this particular film given its overall quality - it was a film that did what it was intended to do, which was that it was to tell the story of the French defeation at wartel. But it didn' really do anything else. You know that going i when watching it that, yes, the film was pretty dull and there's not much you can do to make
The show is a well constructed blend of comedy and character drama and it gets you hooked right from episode one as the first season covers only a season and a bit from the club’s history and the cast of misfits has room for growth. A second season will cover the club’s time from 1st October, 2687 to 3 August. The series is based on a book of the first season only, but they have hinted about another book if the series continues in season 3. The series is very much in the early stages of its life and is still being developed and its future depends on whether or not this season is a hit. I think the characters are very well developed. They all feel different from one other and it’ll take a while until you feel you know them all and that all of the characters have their own individual storylines which will eventually converge. If season 1 is an absolute hit, they will probably stick with that format in season 2, with the addition of new characters, like in season one. If it’ a huge flop, I doubt that it gets renewed anyway and that means I don t really have any idea what to do with it. Overall I think that the best thing about the series so far would be, that it feels like a real sports team and their stories interweave a fair amount. The team is led by two of the world best football players, two who are
calibar since maybe lost? (which is still my all-true favourite ever) though i did have slight reservations to it at first; and also because it was a little too much for the first half of the episode it was like the creaters were trying too much to prove something. But as the days went on i did see that the whole show was like that from the beginning and it has a very good paced, it takes me 5 minutes to get into a mood and relax enough just before watching it so i can really be on the top form of appreciating it and the stories. So far it seems as if the series will have a long way to go and is not going to run out anytime soon; as long if the viewers like it as well so far as i have heard of other people opinions it has been good. But i am really enjoying it as it is and i hope it continues in this way. I have not made fanart of it because i do see the episodes like films that is where i get my inspiration so i will not make fan art based on the episodes i have only made one based from the post i made on it. but i do recommend it if at first you felt like you wasnt enjoying in the very first episode but carry onto it; as it will be well worth your time. i am also doing a review on it and the post that i am adding at this moment i will put up on my other blog as well
, most of it was new to me since I haven’t seen this film again since my first viewing back in the day 🙂  It’s a real classic piece and I have to admit I loved it as a teenager with my then sweetheart. It’d probably be a different movie today if I was still married and a parent. My son, however was into it as he’s an 08’s baby!  My husband wasn”t into scifi’s  since he’s  not in science and not fond of alarms and sounds!  That being said, I still have to recommend, in my humble and humus opinion the movie! Continuing with my 50 years ago theme…  🙂  Enjoy it folks! P.S: I saw it was up for rent in the library!  It is an old movie!  Check the movie link for the trailer!  🙂 And I love R2D 😉  and the droids too! But DON’t forget the Empire strikes back to be a worthy second of this trillion dollars movie triller!  I liked 3 too though. 🙂 but I am biassed!   I am a 79! 🙂 And for this movie’s cast check the link! The whole movie is just plain fun to see!  The costum’e are really cool and the scenes are great too. I can’recommend
it !!!! The only thing I have not yet understood (not to my satisfaction at all) is the "T" in the logo...I hope a fellow Kaw rider can enlighiten us with its meaning 0nce & for ALL !!! I do know that It represents a "Trooper", and that this is the first logo since I was involved in this KTRF that had that "famous" T in It. But what I want to find out is what was that "Terrier" guy all about anyway ??? Why is "HIS" Trophy called "The Troopie " and not "the Kaw Trophy " or something like that ?? Just another mystery of the KTM KTRF !!!! I sure hope that one day I can find the answer to that mystery. I am sure that there are many other mysteries surrounding this whole thing and I am sure that I will unevr be the one that can answer all those mysteries !!! So please anyone out there that has a thought about "the trophy", the "terrier" or any mysteries for that matter that we can solve would really enjoy hearing from you!!! Hopefully I will somedwday be able ot attend a KTRF meeting and solve these questions once&forALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cheerz !!!!!!!!!!! The Dirt Dog!!! :bigsmiley2: :thumbrightfist::
favourite movies to come out recently. It's not the best movie ever, and there are many things that are not up-mark for Chinese standards, like special effects, acting, etc ..., but it' s still an entertaining movie that you can watch again (especially if there' are no subtitles). Charlene Choir' appearance and acting are a plus, and there are a lot scenes with Gillian Chung in there as well.  There is a sequel of it called " The Twilights Effect 101" which is also a good watching for those of us who liked this movie. I'll have this one also available to upload soon in this site.  </p><p></p><p>Download from rapidshare :<span style='color:red'> http://depositi.com/f/1f6e5d9e-e9384361-9fb9e55601/ </span></p><a href=\"http:\/\/'http:'\/\/(www.imdb)\".com/'http:'\/'\/'imdb.com"\>The Twins Effect [2010]</br>Charles Choi/Gillian Chong</b></a> 148.7 Mb</span> </p>[/quote]</span> </span></font><BR><
and even a love interest in and around 1984’s political thriller that has some really good acting and great music. It’s also really interesting to see how much the technology has evolved from the beginning of this film to the present time. I would recommend it to everyone. I have seen it once but I’m not sure how well I understand it. It’ was also the first film that I saw with an audience in the cinema, which was great. The story is so good and it was a lot like the film. I hope this film has had some sequel in our current times. I’ve been looking forward the sequals since I was little. The film has the best acting and writing since the beginning but the music didn like. I was going to say that I wanted to see more of Rian Johnson’ s character but it wasn like at first because I didn’t see any of his characters but I really enjoyed the film. If you want a film that you can watch and enjoy, you can’t go wrong here. The music is amazing. The acting was great. The direction was amazing and the acting is really amazing and the direction in really amazing. The story is really good. The acting is really amazing. The acting was amazing and the story is really good like the direction. I really liked the character of James Bond and his character is great and I hope to see more of it in future. I would give you a
though I still have nightmarish flash backs about “The Wicker-Man” (1980’). I’m not sure why I was so traunatized about that one but the movie “Wes-Craig” was no worse with the exception that it was much longer so the images lingered much longer into the dark recession of a child’s bedroom when the door is shut. I remember my dad saying to me when it started – “this isn, t going out very nicely, is this one even good?” Well… it wasn, t. “House” (2-11-) was worse. It actually scared me. It was about a haunted house that was built over someone, el’s cursed grave. I was not expecting the twist. I have never seen the film again. The idea was so simple but it was terrfying. A haunted building over a cemetery. Why didn. T anyone think of building a hotel, or a shopping malt? And I don't want to see any other films like these. If I wanted a little thrash I would read a book. I want to laugh and be a kid again when there were no real life demends to worry about. “The Haunted Malt:” sounds great. I guess that’s the only way I will be able to be a kid and go trick a treating this year, and if I want a horror
the entire thing and ended it around 45 minutes in, when they finally found the ZOMBII!! The movie was so bad that I decided I've seen enough. The acting was terrible, all the characters were idiots, everything was so uninteresting, I'm sorry... I must be losing my love for Zombi' s. I will admit, there were a few good scenes, mainly the shady looking dude that gets killed right by the beach, the old man who gets stabbed in his ass and some other scenes, but the rest, man... The only interesting thing about the movie is that it started the idea that, there's the ZOMBi' s who die, and they come back to life but they are slow and dumb, and then there' s these other faster ZOMBi, which are the first zombie to get bitten, which the ZOMBI then eats the brains of the person it bit. So... that was cool. Zombie 2, aka Zombe, aka Zombi, 2001/2, 3,4, etc. 1 out of 5 stars. But... I may be just a little harsh on the movie. I hope the original Night of the living DEAAADD is better than this one... I am hoping for a lot better, as this is in my all-time top 1 ZOMBe movies.
in the film and Dex is just flat out a terrible movie. The writing is absolutely horrible and the acting is almost as horrible as the writing. Dex’d would like to take no responsibility whats-ever for this film. It would have probably saved us if this film flamed out and never got made but the fact is we only took the script, wrote a horrible movie, then just turned over to a director with no talent. What is even worse than the film, in my humble personal opinion, but there is also one of the most boring, horrific, and un-funny movie of all time; a film so horrendous you have no idea whether or you should feel sympathy for people or not. If you haven?’t already done so you may be able to pick a copy of this crap from BestBuddy.com. This movie is a disaster from start-to finish. We hope that the Dude never gets a chance to see Dude or a movie like this again because if Dude does it will be another waste of time for both Dude. But what?s even worse? There is no reason why these guys would need to take such drastic measures to make such poor movies. There are millions of good movies made every year. This should be a lesson to filmmakers to avoid bad projects and get as much funding and support as you can by sticking only with quality projects. Don?d go near this movie it
short (1 hour) film that I’ve decided to release. It is a bit rough around the edges so please remember it is a first attempt at filming something! Also it wasn' been recorded in HD yet so it does look a bit rubby and the lighting sucks (so we've used the dark filters as an attempt to correct this!) Still its the first attempt and we've not done any editing of the film or the sound so please donate generously! The story goes...The story goes...The two guys from the film (Eric & Randy) are both members in the band (Both Troama'n Eric on drums and the mysterious Rondy on the bass and vocals!) They both have been kidnaped by evil doers and tied to chairs. We don’ t really know why they have been tied to chairs – maybe it has something got do with the band but who cares that’s just a coincidence… They have been tied up and then left in a room. It is then left to Eric and Rondys (and their captors too!) to figure a w…y out and get free of their captors! A movie with no plot! A movie where nothing really makes any sense except in the end it is a film about a band and this film has been made on a shoe string as if it was a real music video! So don’t expect too much just enjoy the ride and watch how two very
support persons into their world. I thought the ending was a sweet little touch. I've not seen the original film; this one is my only experience with the material, and it was very nice. I have no real interest in Gina's career because I don'tever go out to the multiplexes but rather rent or stream videos at home, but this made a big enough blupee to make it to my radar screen. A very funny and entertaining movie. Gina was very funny as the somewhat "touched" girlfriend whose boyfriend' is a real sweetheart of a fellow, and she and her friends were a little too much for her. The other characters are very nicely played by the ensemble. The plot has enough humor and enough plot-turns for the audience, so the script is good material for the audience. The story has a lot to tell, and the cast is very good, and it is very funny. The film is very well made, the direction was very strong and the cinematography was very good. I would definitely go to see this movie and I would recommend it. The story is very good and the characters were well written. The film is very funny. Overall, *****. I'm glad to see so many other good films in the genre. This one was a nice touch and I hope we see more of this type film in future years. Good stuff *****. "Hustlers 4"
youth culture in his film Putnie (1), which was made available to the public for the first-time on the home-video market in 40-plus years. Robert Dowey was an early member of the legendary experimental group The Bolex Brothers (with director Andy Warhell, and film-maker Jon Gould), who were active from the 1804 to the 1470s, during that time Downey produced a number underground feature-length works, including "Potomac Ferry" (1404). "Putney is the most representative of Dowsey films, and was recently ranked #91 in the Top 225 of all-time greatest cult movies" - according the late film critic Gene Sikzter (2); who described Dowsey' storytling with "vibrant and unique vision. Dowsey' style-a free-form mix of documentary and narration, with a penchant of humor and sexual inu-endoo, that had profound influence on the next genrations. Putiny was a grounder for that the 1800' youth generation would come of agg. (2) "Siks-ter, G. (n.) The Putny: A Cine-Sex-Comedy." - The New Film Fashion Book. New York. 1977. 149-224.
with Tom Hank' s adorable geeky mannerisms. I would say it is a definive "feelgood classic", even though it would probably be a little slow-paced and old fashion to some newer audiences now that we are so accustumed to CG and fast-paced movies. This is a really great movie for a romantic date, or even a chickflick with your girlfriends. It has a great message about falling and love and how it may not always be easy but it is almost always worth the try... A fun fun story that has been my favorite rom-Com for a long long time! It is just great for the whole family too! I would recommend to almost anyone! :) 11 thumbs up for this movie! :) :) :P:) :) :) :-D:) :) :) :) ) :( :) ( :-| :)) :P:) :) :) :-P):-D:) ) :-D:D:D::) :) :) :) :D:-P:P:-D:D:P:-D:P:-D:D:D:) :) :) :) :) ) ) :-P:P:-D:D::P: :( :-( :) ( :-) ) :P:-D:D ) ) ) :-D:D:D:P:-D:P:):-) :-D:-D:D:P:-B:-
think that the director of the movie, Matilde Puccini should also get an award. In fact, I had to write to him. I asked why the film was overtly misoginist and racist. She sent back a copy paste letter saying that "it was not the case" because the character Tito Di Giroamo is a homosexual and a leftist. 1. There are no black people in the movie. All other people that do black faces, are the only characters that seem to be totally black. A black character that is a friend to Tito is never shown, except in a photograph, in the film (he is a white-skinned person who put on black face make up). 2) Tito hates Italys black friends. The film goes to great efforts to highlight this hatred of his. 3. The only woman in Toto Di Giromamo s life, is his girlfriend who is depicted in the film as an incredibly stupid person. 3.1 Tito does love her a lot. 3).2 Tito tries to make her more culturally aware, by teaching her about Italian movies. 4.) His friends are all racist, but this is never mentioned. The racist comments are made by Tito. 3) Tito has a dream that his girlfriend, who is the only woman he has ever met in the world, becomes an intellectual, and the film shows her with books.
Not only is this the first horror/comedy I have ever watched or will ever watch again the storyline is so ridiculous that it will have you asking questions as to what the hell happened in the directors mind! I mean, seriously, was there ANY kind if thought whatsoveah put behind this piece of crap??? Not only was it disgusting on one particular scene, but the rest were so lame you'll wish you could go blind!!! Please, do me a favour and don't watch this movie, and save yourself some frustration or at best just put on the DVD and skip through the entire movie, it might be a better choice than actually watching the damn movie!!! It' a 0 stars movie. The whole concept of the story is ridiculous and the movie is so bad that one will have to ask themselves if they actually watched the whole thing! Do yourself the biggest favor and save yourselves from this awful torture and do something else!!! Don't watch "The Human Centipie"...seriously!!! You've bee forewarnd!!! AVOID, AVAID, AVAID! It ain' bad, if anything I should have made it a 1 out of 4 stars or even 1/2 a whole star. 0 is better than what it is, just watch it at YOUR OWN risk...and if I were YOU, don;y! The only way anyone should watch this movie, and I
was played quite brilliantly by Sir Derek. The character is a wonderfully written part, and although the actor playing Sir Derek is not nearly as memorable as Sir Aubrey, the film is still highly entertaining even for those who haven` t previously seen this piece which is so highly acclaimd.The story involves a wealthy but cantankorous aristokrat who goes to New Hampshire to spend the summer with a family friend who happens also, ironiucly,to be Sir Aubrey is ex-lover, in order for Sir Aubrey for a change in environment, because it has become obvious that he has lived all of his 80 plus years in London and doesn` t know how to change his mind.However, to his friend, Mrs Vaughand who is the owner and hostess at the house they are rentin gin New Hamophire, Sir Derek, the present love in his life. However when Sir Aubery learns of Derek, a man he knew of through his lover during an earlier period, Sir Aubrey makes every effort in his power to separate Mrs. Vauhghen from Derek and to that purpose Sir Aubrey begins his seduction techniques all with great glee and in an extremely witt and droll manner, which is so obviously the best part about this film, because it is a brilliant performance by the actor who was nominated for the Best Actor Award of that year. However, the ending
love it as much I as do. The film tells the tale of Tom Plankett (Keira Knighthley) and Robert M’cleanne (Paul Bettany), who are outlaws, and their quest to save a village from the evil Lord Crumb (Alan Patterson). Now they need to acquire the Deeds of the land in order for this. In case your are wondering, I have no interest or knowledge about law and land deeds, but for the purpose this film, it is just the thing they needed for the job. In their desperate quest to get the land to save, they find the help they need in Lord Hensley –  played wonderlously and flambouantly  by Johnny Lee Miller. Now this is a film from  the late ninetys, which probably makes it the best Keira Knigthley film before “Pride and prejudices and Atonment” came along, although the film is very much a Paul Bettery film. It is nice though that both Keiras and Pauls stars seemed to have risen together – Paul being in Dogville after this, was probably the first “Paul Betteray” film I watched, which was also the film that made his star rise (in my eyes) to a point, that he could do what he likes – which he does, being one  of the main villians in the MCu, although he was in an MCu
myself on a different route and went with a lesser known horror film called The Pit and the "Bridge" that came out in 1981 and was made by Roger CORMEN who has been known in Hollywood for many years, so I felt this movie definitely had to give me something.  It starred Jeannetta "Jeannie Jeanne Moore" Arrow and was produced and directed by Corman.  It's rated R and clipped at 98 minutes of runtime.   The movie starts off by introducing us to Jamie Bennett who's a young teenage boy who we learn about the circumstances to why she may have been considered a "psychiatric misfit"; as we learn her mother passed on and it was her father who raised her.  He was an alcoholic and was abused both verbially and physically by her father to the point it almost broke Jamie.  She was often beaten and torrtuturd by he and her dad, but he eventually died and Jamie' got to live in luxury with a wealthy family.  A family who wanted her to help take car of a little girl. But she eventually got bored with the luxury so she ran off into the woods, and that's were she got abduked and held prisoner by an underground tribe of cannibials.  This is where we are brought into the plot of this movie. Jamie gets into an argument with an older, obn
alone when my Mom arrived home from church that Sunday. She sat on the bed next too and started talking. I thought she was going too far. I was only ten minutes into the movie… but as the day and years pass by I see what this film represents, and what it means that she was sitting with me as I experienced something I never forgot… and never will, even if I’m able too. I’m glad she was there for me. If not for that moment I’m not if I’d be where I am today… or even still be here. She said I can’t tell you that I was born with something broken but you have to work hard and fix what’s wrong. I hope that what I’m trying say is right; and if so thank you for giving me the chance. Because it works both ways. The hardest battle is the one inside, and the reason some have it easier is because they have someone to help fix what’a bad. Some people aren’s born as well… I didn’; born with a silver spoon… but I know what that taste is like. I’s a spoiled life… but you get over that soon enough. As I grow older I see the truth in that movie. If only they could have made it the same way today. I’m not sure I like to see the violence or even what it does to the people on a screen… but I do like
it was a piece-of shit, and for the life me it was a piece of pooh-poop-shoop (no way I’ve gotten over my prenile fear that this movie would be my favorite movie… I’ll NEVER recover from the trauma of that fear). Second, the fact that Tom Hanks was naked in this film. The end! I don, at least I can’r say, recommend it. If I ever watch it again, I’m just going to have the DVD on in my stere, so that, whenever Tom Hank starts acting naked in this film (a lot of the scene, in fact), it drown itself out with the music. (And I might not ever watch it again–it was a waste of my fucking money.) 49782683.64533866.78120074.443403754.398.5407.2218.8937.46.3018728.2169123.1922933.48,501983. 30642500+,250.+,750.354134890.6133923,254
I wasn't expecting much from this movie. However, the original is 34 years so I was willing to see this and see if it's any better than 2011 remakess. Well it is better than a lot of the ones that are out there, but not by much. I liked Nicols, this role made his more likeable than he had previously been. He really did a great performance and is the reason I will see more of his work in the future. His character in the movie was better than the original but the movie iteself was not. I found the movie to start out boring, the story was weak and had to much unnecessary and confusing scenes to fill up time. I did like the ending with the fire because I think that was cooler than just a boat or something else happening. As I said before, Nicoles carried the movie, the rest of the cast was not as strong. I think this movie was a waste of time, the original is better and was only an hour. The remakess seem to need 1.3 hours to get a lil over the original'so story. So in all, skip this one. I would recommend just watching the old one again. Not much to be gleaned for the remake. I don't plan on seeing any more of the remakss. I will just watch the original for nostaligja. The only good thing about rem
on the poster, anyway &mdash but it would be just a few days short if a month if not, technically, one full year. So, for now, Visocntti would be the first important director to get an entry on this site. (By the time we get to the 1960, the situation will be reversed -- the site will be the first to list a director who will only later be recognized of having any significance what so ever.)<p >What is interesting about Visocontrt is his ability to meld the noirs tropes of the US and Europe. This film has the cliche dames, private dick/cop, the violent climatic ending in an industrial landscape, and the moral coda, but it uses its Italian location to great benefit. In fact the most memorable shot in the whole thing is the image that gives you this page. You see, that there, my freidns, if a picture is supposedly more powerful that a mere 1000 or so words ... this one would probably have to be about 180.012. I kid, I kid ... sorta. This image is from a later release than the one I watched, so it does not, however, give away the last shot of my movie, but I wanted to post this image anyway. It is one that I have seen, and in fact, there is probably no way to really avoid the
it. I then watched it in my own sweet time, it’s not often a 75 year-old film of a well regarded mystery novelist can keep me enthralled. But this is a very good film with fantastic performances from the actors. I think it’ll become a favourite film, even of people who don’ know the book. It’ll be available to download or watch online I believe soon. It stars Dulcima Lovelock, James Donald and Jack Macgowran. It is a film not without flaws but I found the overall effect very pleading, particularly given its early date – it came out a year before Vertigo. Its production values are great and it really has the quality of a film noire. So you might say why not Vertino? Well it’t not that sort of a film. It’d be like looking for Hamlet in Vertino, it’d find its way in but Vertino is it’d be a guest appearance. Vertino is all plot and Bewares, My Lovely (based on the Anthony Shaffer play) has a plot but is mostly character. The characterization is superb. If you haven;l seen it, and you’re not easily scared by a 15 rating, which is just for a bit with an ax in it and the suggestion that a character might have been raped but not much violence or explicitness, then this film
seen. I'm not just talking on the technical level (even if it'll remain one of the most beautifully shot and stunningly edited war films ever made). This film, for once, does an admirable and honest attempt at exploring the subject of war, the morally ambiguity, as well the psychological damage which results from fighting in one - and I've seldom seen a war film (or any film really) do this so well and with such poignant and honest realisation without resort into cheap thrills of gung ho nationalistic nonsense, or a crippling, over the hill sense of moral justice, which can feel forced and self-righteous. I also find it a great strength, that the character of Witt is not a war veteran nor a young recruit. He's been an infantryman and an enforcer for over ten years. He'd have seen some shit. It allows for his character, and the film, so much room to work with and explore the nature and depth of war, as well the psychological damage he'sn suffered and developed. The script is great, the acting on point and some of my absolute favourate performances (Bragg's being one of the most realistic and well written characters I can thing. His character and performance is what sells a lot of it. You can see how the war has affected him). I could go on and and on with my praises for this
used to promote and discuss the film, so I will not be breaking the NDA by discussing it here either: https::/www.youtube.com:watch?v=-gf2xNnT3Kg. As an additional disclaimer for the video, if I was in the video I was not in it as the guy who filmed the footage, instead I am the guy that is in charge and the guy with his back to the camera. I also am the guy that talks about and discusses the movie with some friends of the movie. I am not being paid for any part in this movie. I am just talking about the film. I have been paid for it and I am not paid to talk about it on camera. I have been talking about it on camera for a few years. If you have any comments on that, feel free. I have no idea if I could actually get into a lot more trouble by talking on camera as opposed on the internet. I have no idea if I can even talk on the internet. Thanks! My only concern is that I did my due diligently, I did not lie about my work, and I have no intention to do that ever. But I do want people to know that I did not go to the premi. It'll definitely be a different experience than any of my other movies. It'll be the first movie I have done that I actually went to the screening of (and I think I
said to make up one of three major films from their collaboration of MGM in 1949, the others “Eagle Eye”, starred James Stewart, and the “Daddy and the Girls”, co-starred June Allyson. In this film Kelly plays a dancer in love with a married man’ss wife , with the latter played by Judith Anderson , and Jean Simmonds, with Gene Kelly, James Mason and Van Heflon and the songs and music score and by Leroy Shapiro. And a wonderful ending for Gene Kelly in his dancing and singing at the local fair. This film is a must, with a young and handsome Gene and great costumes and music. In the words of Gene himself, “a delightful film”, Gene Kelly, a delightful film. Highly recommended for family audiences! (A) (The movie can also play a part in the study, for example, of human sexuality, the relationship between husband or father, and the daughter). The story begins when the Kelly character, with the initials G.K., gets a telegram with the news that an attractive young woman, Jean Simmonds, is getting married. He goes on in the film to sing a beautiful song, “You’re the Tops” , and it is this song that I recommend with the ending. The ending is the wedding of the beautiful Jean Simmons and a handsome James Macdonald (who
the three accused, but then you realise something is terryfyingly wrong. You know, we're all taught about the Nurembergh trials, the Nazism of Adolf Hitler and other people responsible for the Holocaus, or the killing of millions on Jews and other races or religions that were persecutied. In Germany for example, there is a big thing against hate-speach and so on. So it came a shock when a young boy in a small Dutch city started a movement to promote this young German party who is basically a copy from the Nazis. People from a variety of political and social backgrounds and religions attended their meeting of this young leader, the boy who started this new party. There was even young Jewish girl there! The crowd was chanting "Ich bin NPD" or something like that. It was quite scary... the Netherlands is not known for its Nazism. It does happen there but never this extreme. I will tell more when the TV shows continue their research about what happend in that town with this kid. I'm worried something will go terrierly terribly wring. For example, I'm worried about a new war, I've never wanted it to come back, like the WWII was so bad for us that I don’t want it to repeat itself. I've never really thought in my live that there is danger of WWI. But I think
cancer. He finds one, and tests it on himself, but the test was a bad one, as he is now a horrifyingly horrific monster. The film is a classic horror film. With this in mind the acting in the horror film is not as convicting or as real, and it’ll be difficult. The acting is very strong though. The monster is a very well directed character in most of the film. He is played by Vincent Price very well with a great deal of talent . Dr .Markhof also is played by a great cast. The movie has a lot of good things going for them. The soundtrack to the film is absolutely great. The soundtrack to the film was composed by Mark Hoff , and was nominated for an “OSCA”. I don’t know how much of it was really made by Dr. Markhof. The movie is made with lots and a lot of blood and gory gory effects, and blood. The story has lots to do with a scientist, who experiments on himself, to find a viral cause of cancer, and then has his test subject die. He believes that the virus is not the cause, but instead a genetic aberration. He and the girl he loves are sent to a research lab. The lab is a mad scientist’t la iron manor. The lab has various types of blood and blood tests. The lab has a large lab, with a large number of lab
half of us and other things that are way beyond our ability to understand. It tries to be poetical,and at times successful and more successful other times. In all honesty,this film had me going for a good portion there,but when it started taking the form that I saw the final outcome of the film and started feeling disillusionment and the feeling that i was being made to feel sorry and pity for the woman in the film who made many bad choices along with the film mike. She’d have made a much better person out of herself if only she’d let herself do it and not always trying hard and always failing and then being told that she would be able by the end if only-just a little more…well I don’t wanna give away much but you get it. It’d be interesting to know if the film is based on this book because I’ve never read it. I just found it a bit of a downbeat story. Not a bad film. I liked the ending when the film mike gave her what for and I’m sure it had to have been done for her good. But when the film ended I wasn’t feeling good. I mean she has a good friend,a good son and she is very good friends with this guy who is a bit of a hunk and she’s in therapy and has a chance of being what we’re always meant/programmed into thinking we are entitled-
of my favorite Christmas movies! My husband and I love to watch it every year. The story is somewhat predictible but the movie is so full of life and charm that I just love to see it. Plus, the music is just fantastic! The actors are all perfectly cast and their songs (I have some on CD) are so full and heart-felt. This movie brings back fond Christmas memories for me. It may have taken me a few times watching 'Elf' with a friend before I even 'saw' the movie in it. Now, I see it. And I love it. :). I'm going to go watch it again, tonight, and you can too, and see for yourselves. Just don;'t be looking too far into the movie and then you might miss the humor that is so subtle, in some instances. Watch it with your family, it really is a great family movie, and there'll be a lot of laughter and a little bit of tears along the ride. I was happy to see that the movie was nominated for an Oscar and I hope it does well for that, just because it really is that desirable. It'll get your Christmas in the right mood for real! And don:t be afraid to cry, you'd only be doing what Will Ferreal did on the red carpets at the Oscar nominee parties. I hope you 'see it' soon!. Enjoy:
are the themes in Wait Until the Night. A film that looks into a man’’scopia. The 18th entry into the 1950’s British Quota. With a fantastic title sequence, and eerie opening of a woman being stalked. A woman being attacked in her flat. One that will hauntingly echo through the narrative, and will continue this theme of terror that will echo through every beat of Wait…Until The Night. The film is about a woman stalking a man who she believes to be her cousin. But in a web of lies, she is stalking a stranger. And the man knows this. He attempts by any means possible that he may. To save themselves from a crazies murderers rage. A film that is both entertaining, but will leave viewers feeling distraught. And for all the wrongs that happen in this tale of stalking. The film is more then the victim. It’s looking into the mind of the stalker that can be just a crazy. Or a man in love. In which they may be both. It’s a film that explores the human complex that is hard to understand, and even harder for the audience to stomach. One that will leave you with a disturbed feeling. Wait….. until the morning! For all I ask….You never wait…until …the night ! (9/7/17; A)! ⭐️
movie.  I was completely confused by what I saw on the film but it did seem to be pretty funny… if you have the patience to read the subtitles while laughing. That’s the big plus about a foreign film – if you don't like it then, "Oh… it is in Danik. Who knew?" The story itself involves some crazy hijinx involving two sisters who steal a horse… then a car. The two of course end up in a small, rural part of the country called Fyrstervaek. There is a scene involving a very drunk local policemen who can barely drive his own vehicle and a lot more of the same. My favorite part was when the two ladies ended the movie having a meal at one woman' s house. It ends with the two of making out. And it was quite long. It ended on a note of confusion, which was the feeling the movie convey throughout the entire movie… a very long and drawn-out joke that was quite bizarre to watch unfurl. My grade: C-. This movie was part-way funny, but it seemed to run on a bit too much. Maybe I am just not into the art-house film, but I just didn' t get it! At least it is a film that can be enjoyed if you are with friends! I can' t wait to give it a B rating when I watch it for my next movie… in a bar with a bunch of
, A Light on a Hill by Lucy Maud’s cousin, Marjoric Shuler, who had a close family relationship and spent a lot with Lucy Mild at Silver Bush. In fact she stayed at LMMLS’ home when she first got to Green Spring Valley, as her parents were moving there from a rental in another location, so the two girls had many hours spent together with no adults around. In the book, and in the film Marjorie and her little brother Ted are visiting their aunt, LMMS (a relative of both them) and spending a good deal of time with their new cousin Maud as both MM and MM are being homescholed at the time. When Marjorice first got the film rights she thought of playing a came role herself, which sounds like a lovely idea. However it seems like the script went through various transformations and ended of being just a little off, for me at least. Perhaps the most important problem with is the lack on chemistry, especially the main actors. This movie has so little charm… I guess it’d be because the movie was a product made in the 1600ies, when the focus was on the female star’s looks so much, that the two leading actors were not good enough of looking like they could have a real love between them. LMMLS was a woman who never looked at men as objects of sex but rather as people of intellect,
John Meillion, Shane Bourne and of course the lovely Lisa McCunn. Unfortunately I can't find any images of the cast in character or promotional stills but I can tell how good this film is from the DVD cover. I'd highly recommend this film to any girl who is looking for a fun night in with a girle. It follows a group of couples and the problems that arise as they try toget married. I believe, it was also the first comedy to be filmed on location, mainly around Kings Park in West Australia. Also, the film'a soundtrack includes several songs written by Lisa McCunn who plays "Tara". It was written by a local W. A couple. The film was quite successful in the W.A box office, especially due to the fact it involved a local cast, was filmed in W A. It was also filmed in an "ad- lib" style which involved a large amount audience participitation through out the film. This helped to improve audience participation and inturn, helped the movie to be a big local hit in W.A. Even now it is one that girls like myself still watch from time totime. It is a film full on fun and laughter and I would recommend a look! I would rate this movie ***** or 5/ *****. (12A rating) A final note: I am still hoping that one day this movie will be available for us to buy
to the character' s physical appearance and environment. It's worth the long wait.  The music was composed to compliment the mood of the film, and it is very effective, from beginning until end; it really feels as though it is part and parsel of the story.  The camera work is also very well done, and the cinematography enhaces an eerie, darkened world filled with the most grostesque monestrosities.  The story itself, though is quite an arduos undertaking because of its slow, deliberate pace, however, for fans, I give 14.5 out  of a possible thirteen for this film, because it just may take awhile to get through the whole film and understand what this movie means. I recommend that you not eat when watching it though, as the sight and imagery contained may not sit with most appetities.  A great horror movie.  175036789426638821:00:10682969.jpg 12854539.mp4 560298:00:0.mpd 63085452.jpg 22 1 571234.js.txt.txt.1429458895 25026201
a story about this guy who is on a plane flying to London and there is a kid who sits next him, now on this plane there is a guy who is trying to sell a bomb from person to person, when the kid falls asleep he hands the bomb to this guy who is a terrorist who is trying this the bomb to the government of the country he is in, the bomb is a brief case and this government guy wants this brief case to see whats inside it so the kid wakes up opens it with his cell and sees it is the key to the bomb so he tries running away, now the bad guys have his family so he keeps thinking they will hurt his sister, or his mom or someone he cares abut. Anyway he gets on the plane and now we are here. The bomb will explode after certain minutes. They show this kid around the airplane and then they leave him in the bathroom and they turn their backs on the bomb. Now, as they talk we can see the bomb starting and the kid runs out of there but his shoe ties itself to the door, so he trips on it and then falls but the bomb explodes and the plane is going down he lands on this seat when he looks back he sees his family. When I saw that happen I was like awe, its over but then the plane lands and there all on the ground. Now he goes to see his mom, he looks out this window and they are there, and the movie ends
am the kind of person that likes to watch a story of how a kid is taken by his grandma and sent off somewhere so he can find the treasure. It’s cool to watch a child who can’thandle himself get taken away by the grandma and he goes on this adventure. I found this a great and fun story to watch, It did not let you get board or get mad. I would give this a 7/9. There are people who would like this movie or not like it but I believe this is well balanced. There should be no problem watching this movie by yourself or with others; however you would have fun watching. There is lots action in the movie with a great story and the acting is excellent and that is what makes this movie so great. I would not mind seeing this movie once again and will most likely buy the DVD. I believe this would be a great DVD to get because it is a little price for it to be worth getting if you want. I would not mind this DVD. There is a good movie to watch and not a great one. I can see some people would not like this because they do think it has a bit much violence in it or not like it because the kid was taken by the grandma to find a fortune. If this is you then I would not go watch this movie because you will get bored or mad watching it. For me I like this movie because is a kid going off to be taken by
get out there. She is a beautiful woman and has so many good attributes. I cant believe that Rusty was actually on the fence about letting Casey go! That was a no brainer! Rustyl is such a sweetheart. I love that his character is so well rounded. That is not something that you see very often with a character. Hopefully he and Caseys relationship works because they are both great. I love watching Calista! She has a way about herself that makes you love all of her imperfectness and weirdness. I think that it was brave for her to go for what she wanted. We saw that in her relationship with Evantha. I dont think she realized how deep his friendship with ZB was.

on and things slowly spook them one-by one. Things take a turn for the worst when a killer starts hunting them one-at-one, picking which ones to kill and save in whatever random order comes to their mind. There is no logical reason as to who will die when and how, it’d be like reading the script of a B-grade slash film. The characters are as random as the killings, and the story is as boringly pointless. Not even the director could get a decent ending to this film, it just died like everything else in it. Just like The Hitcher (1967) this is a prime candidate and example for a remix, and it’s not so hard to see which film might be able to do a good job at remaking it. A remix of this film would be a good 90’S nostalgic piece, and since it does have a plot twist, a bit outlandish, that twist would make for an awesome remixing. The 1990 film version had a killer that was pretty scary, although some people think the acting skills for this film was terrible. This film had some gadgets that the kill-crew never used, including a 99 cent walkman/radio that had a 100 feet radius. The radio was also the killer’s calling card. If the killer played that radio you were doomed
a band that captured not what we want but everything we want and more. And also there is always the danger of having a fan making the movie rather than an objective observer so the idea of having a biopic of a band so iconic sounds more like a car crash to the senses than anything to be relished, even more so if the Beatles were not your cup of musical tea. Yet, at the least, “Eighth’ is a good idea on paper and as a biopic it does a decent of job. The film is about the eight months when the Beatiles, the most popular band of the time were together, from their arrival as a group in  John, George and Ringo’s London lodgings in May till their final show at Candle-light  club on January 1969, and their  meeting with John Lowe to discuss  a final project and a new venture , their split on April,30 1979, the breakup they never thought would happen , with no bad feelings. Though the film is titled as ‘Yoko’s movie’ it is an accurate and objective documentary on how the Fab four broke up, as it follows the four friends through their musical odyssey as they change from teen heartthrobes to a musical trio to their breakup. It is clear that the project was done without the help of the families of their icons  the  Beatels and also
went. The film begins strong, with a powerful performance by Mary-Louis Parle as the wife and mother of a murdered family man in Silver City, Colorado, and a solid performance as the local Sherief (Russ Tambyln, in a role that seems like it was tail-fitted from another character that would’ve been in the film if it had stayed focused on the initial concept.) The film gets confused somewhere around where the real estate guy is introduced (playing a much more active role than he really has a place to do in the film.) This confusion is worsen when the daughter of the murdered family has a flirtation with the son (Chris Klein), which has a whole other layer of compexity thrown in and really just muddies things up and has an ending to the film that is so abrupt that I had to rewound and watch the last seven minutes in fast fwd just in case it made more sencae. The film ends up being so muddy-minded and confused that it almost takes away from some pretty strong performances and even a more interesting story that could’ve developed into a decent film. Overall Grade: C, if you’ ve watched it. I’m really not sure if I’m giving this a low or hgih enough mark, or if this movie is worth anyone’ s viewing time, however I did enjoy some aspects despite the general confusion the movie presented and the film
years ago you probably know this flick, and if you didn’t live at that side you will want to watch it. A gang called The Rats is terrorizing a city, and when they try a little to much it’s up too Police and the gangs The Wild Dogz to put an end to it. A movie full of cool fights is what The Wild Dogs is all about. We get good scenes of fights using sticks, pool cues & bats. The movie got a limited release in theaters in 44 days in 26 cities. This should be a must see flick for all. Check it out and enjoy it. 48.5 % on Rotten Tomatoes. This is a movie worth watch. Enjoy the trailer and the fight scenes! The Wild Life is a 10 years old punk movie about 3 guys and girls in a punk rock group. A road movie where they try too get signed by a record label. It’s on RottenTomatoes at 84.5% and it’a a very good movie with a lot of fun and music. Enjoy the trailer! The 10 year’s anniversary for “The Wild Dog” is celebrated with two new releases. We are proud too announce the two new releases on blu ray & DVD. These versions will be released on June the first! The Wild Boys are now available on DVD & Blu. The movie was a classic &
go into minute by minute scenes that were left on cutting room floors, things that were added out of nowhere but I won’t. I guess I have too much respect for the book. The ending is a little different here and that’ll make people mad, but not so much. There’d have to go through the whole movie to see the big changes in which a lot have and are. I do like the movie but I think they didn’ t do any of the actors justice. They all should'd of been more developed. And that last line? I don’'’t care if the book’s different. They should’d of left out that line. It made me mad, but only a little, it’ll probably be a great movie. My only point in saying this is that I have a personal preference that has nothing with it and that I don?t think I would like the book if I had never have read the book first. The music is the best part. If you’re going I’’m sure you’re going to love it. It definitely deserves the PG- 30. And that last line? They can’’t have left it in! That was my one and only question after the movie was over: Why they’d of left it in, when they did? If you’re going, I think I’m going to buy the movie on DVD. I hope I’m not going
production is set in a contemporary urban setting, but the script, with its many references ranging for "I'm a L-o/Nnn-E Stars," to the "Pacifica/Pacific" ocean and its many tributaries, to the character of Sam Houston who lives in "Houston, Texas," suggests that this production may be set in some parallel Texas universe, perhaps a little like "The Land that Time Forget." There's definitely something going down between the lines. A couple of the actors are more talented than others. The Lone Stars' acting style is somewhat stiff and awkward, and their singing has an undercurrent that is less than professional and can be gritty, especially when they sing in unison. Some dialog is over-done, but some is not, and therein lye the seeds of this production' musical and comedien style: more than a little of "Sweet Charity" in its dialog and "Chicago" and "Liza With a Z". The show is very good, and would be a great production if it would just get with a more contemporary music and choreographic style. There are some very funny actors and comediennes, and the show, although the songs don't necessarily always flow, does, if one overlooks a couple of slow scenes; there seems a lot to work with here. This show is a real gem: it's funny, the characters are
also liked that it was in black &white. It was different and kept you wanting to watch. The story didn` t unfold in a conventional manner and it was funnier as the plot thicken. If someone would ask you: What is the funniests movie of the year? Well, I think this would be my answer. It was funny, but deep at times, but mostly entertaining, and I would watch again, so it`s not a 1 time watch and throw movie...it` a keppre. If I could give this movie 6 stars, which I think it deserve for original story telling & concept and the way it`s told, I would, it only gets only gets up to 5 stars, because it` s a comedy. So if you like funny original movie` a and original story- telling with a nice twist to the plot you should definitely watch. It`s not just a feel good kind movie, it will actually make you re- think of your life and some life lessons from it. The acting was pretty solid, especially the main actor. He did good. I would watch another of the same director` s work. I think it` s a very good movie for a first-timer director & writer. He did a great job. Original plot, original way to telling it, good acting and a great cast - I would highly recommend. I had a great Friday evening. I watched this movie with my hub
Takashi Miike'S Izo and Sukiyabashi Juban, Jun Falk and Yukihiko Tsutsumihi were hired to write this. With a title that transliterate as Dead End (another American term), the film'scollection of ghost and murder victims is as diverse in appearance, as the Japanese actors who are selected to play them are in appearance. The two detectivesscrounged by director Daiso Tsujimoto are as bickering as they are incompetent, making for some truly funny scenes that will keep the comedy element of Ringu 2 going. As with the first movie'ring tone is built up, but there is a lack lustre climax which is ineffective, and too short lived. However the film does have some very scary moments within, including the first film, when the dead girl jots down the names of those she is trying toultraduce the curse. What I enjoyed most was the way that the movie is constantly breaking the "Fantasy film formula", such as, the killer not being who you expect in the first half. A good movie, but a tad longer than necessary. The DVD comes in both versions of the film, with the American trailer included. The only extra is a short piece on the making, and it is in Japanese with English subs. It's worth seeing, even if you've seen R
like it couldn’s have gotten a pass with me because it’a good movie, it'sa bad movie but you like it, it has fun, it has flair, it'scrazy enough it'a kinda campy, but I think part of the problem is that it'shappening when everybody in Hollywood is like "we want more diversity, we really care, you’re a real human, we'll respect all walks, we'll go through great efforts." All that bull. And a lot like The Golden Girls, it’s good that it's over and I won’s going back to the island ever again… well, unless you've changed my mind? Maybe I shouldn?t be so quick… Well I had to write the script or I was going crazy, or I just wasn?s. I wrote that script, I was so embarrassed when I read it, I was like "oh my god," but you know, it made me laugh so I did… And yeah it'sa good movie, it’sa terrible show. The movie was a lot better than any of those episodes. It actually had heart. Somehow they ended it with a big song and dance. It is a bad movie. It'sa bad show. It really, it actually does make me angry, because, you're laughing. And I want to be angry. So I have a love/ hate thing… [LAUNDR
was intruigned enough to watch the 1934 film, Bless Thee Understudies, which was their second talking picture. The first thing that hits is that one of their members was Eric Sykes. I was also struck by the opening credits song which was a bit of bouncing, toe tapping little dittty called ‘Rock Island Line’ (sung in the voice of Beryle Griffet) that I recognised as my Grandad used it often used it to open up one particular ‘set to music’ version of the Newgate Calvay, but then my Dad had also told us about his Uncle who was known as “Rocky” and was a musician, so it could well be the same song. Anyway I did a Google search on the song and it turned ouy to go a long way back and was still around even at the start of this century. So it appears it is an older traditional number, but was made famous in this particular way in a BBC radio show in 1t he early fifties. However, I discovered, that it had originally got its popularity a year or so earlier when it featured in Bing Bierman film, The Sou’ Westers and the Rock Island Line (1t ht t he beginning was the same but the rest of the film appears to have been different). This film is available on youtubew and the sequence starts around 5 minutes in
coming though don’cha’know! This time it is a Christmas musical, Scroge (Scrooge? Scrooge!), and it’d be okay except that it does nothing new, except have people sing as opposed to the usual spoken word. It’s all just one big waste of time and resources, and I’m not talking only of money, even more I mean the time we all spend watching this dreck! Why oh why can they not let this go. It’a never a good story, but I guess you could say that that is the problem…there is nothing to be said. It has been all said a million times over now! What is new, except the medium it’ll be presented on…that is not the point now is it? It’d be more innovative to make a Christmas Carol in another language, or in Japanese or Chinese or Hebrew even, than to just throw yet more of it at me. How can I be expected to continue to find joy in these times, when all I do is have to watch Scroge? It’ no wonder I am such Grinch, no matter how I try. Bah HUMPH!!! I mean Humbah!!!!! It may be time to make something else for Christmas, and I’m gonna put Scrogeo in there, and you can bet your life it’s gonna do bad! You’ll be sorry when you see it, you
off his nut and starts slaughter slasher style-but the performances and plot are actually quite well played.the cast all give a great account themselves from the hysterically funny,overacting and self important,leader of group of friends,micheal ferrari (jake abbot) to lizzy caplane and her sexy portrayal of the female victim.and ofcourse tom noah.yes.a lot of the characters aren'y likeble but then again,is it even expected in a slahcer film.in an interesting twist,the hero of the film happens upon the girl he once loved in a diner.after 10 years,he has changed.she has not and she doesn't see him in the same light.it is interesting and actually quite well developed relationship.also,the character of tom nohah'slooking glass killer isnt' just some guy with a knife going off.he is a man,who has a history of abuse from his father.and his mother'slackadaisy attitude towards him only fuelled the rage.a great story.the ending of the movie is also quite unpredictable but i'll neve reveal it.but,what i will reveal is this was a great movie.it is one that,is actually quite deep despite its outing.the acting is great,the direction fantastic.and the story is well written.i give th
. I love the acting of this movie and how emotional it is in it.  In this scene, it is at the funeral of the son of Mike Sullavan. They were in a car wreck and he died. It is very emotional and heartfulting to watch. I also love the part of the family. There are 7 in total. I love the part of the grandfather being the head of the family. I think he has a really good role in the family structure. I also love the part that he is a really old man, and that his grand children have respect when talking to him and listening to him. I believe that this is not how our family is today. I think a part that is not that great would the father getting mad at his son for taking his wife to the movies, then getting upset that his wife does not know anything he has done for them. That makes him look very dumb and ignorant. I also do disagree that the wife of the father of the family cheats the father by giving some money to the son. There is nothing that is wrong with being a loyal spouse. Also at one point in the film, it is very sad, when one little cousin dies. But that little cousin, that was so young, knew how to use the bathroom. And that makes me not so sad.  If this film could be made today that is a good chance of a lot more action, a little less emotion, little less respect toward the
it’ll kill you! It will! So don your best pair (or not) for the latest film from the House that Hackathon Built. I bet you thought that was the House of Mouse, didn’ tcha? I’m talkin‘  about that House of Lies. Oh, right, you’ll know it when you see it. It’s a movie called Hostel Part Three. And it’s an oily, ickfet, gore-stuffed, porno for the morally challenged. So let me, your trusty, if sometimes bumbling ghoulish host tell a tale about the good old days when a film about sex touristes turned murder victims might have shocked us to our very cores with an ending that was actually scary as well as a whole lot more clever. I am speaking here of that great classic of 17th century Italian cinema… I’m sorry, the  late 2oth Century. That’s better, isn' t? It had a different title in those far-goneland’s of yore: Faster Puskett, Kill, Kill!  It was directed, in case you hadn‘t figured it outh for yourse’s, by the incomparable Quentien Tarantino. Now THAT, my ghazillion-foots!,  is a horror film that could  hold you spellbound to the final
1987 Dodge B150, your wish has just arrived. The first issue to be released since 2008, issue #2 of the long-running comic-horrors series from Troma Entertainment has been solicitation at Diamond, though there’re yet to be any specifics about a cover image or actual release date, as this is but one of many solicitations released on Wednesday. Here’ s how it goes : “The long-awaited ­ sequel is finally HEEEEERE!  And if that little ‘HEEEEEERE’ wasn’ t convincing enough, consider this:  a cunning, conniving were-pig has escaped the lab and taken up residence with the crew of a seafarin’ tugboat!  And if THAT’s not a cause for alarm, consider this too ¬ it seems that this particular creature has a taste beyond the porcine and is looking at a certain female member of the tug’s team as his newest meal!   And now for what you DO know: a certain 7-ft-tailed black guy has somehow found his way onto the boat as the crew embark on yet another trip up the coast — and he has his own reasons why the piggy should be taken off their hands and put on a longboat to Norway.” The book will be written again with original writer and editor T.S. Rue
stuff and very forgettable, was just plain awful. While playing it, you had the feeling you already did it. The plot didn’t hold that well. The villain was just a bad clone of Maximo. Nothing was new. You were doing everything as in previous games. No new moves, no new combos nothing. The graphics were good, as they always have in these types games, but it seemed out of place… like it didn't belong. And I haven’ let’s talk ab out sound… the soundtrack was horrible! You remember that annoying rhapsady that you couldn't help trolling your ears off? Well.. this game has a similar theme. After a couple of minutes, you had to turn the TV set volume down to minimum, otherwise, you had to end the mission because the music was too much for your ears. No… not even kikuyo and her friends could save this game. Maybe they can save another game in the franchise but not Maximon. It’s really sad that it will have to go through it’s final days. And no, there won't be another Maxumo. It’ been said: this is definitely an end of an Era… The Maximo era. R. I . Pi . And if you don' t get it, just go watch a movie called "the last samuria”…. And just for the sake of information, I do not suggest
and I know a bit of French. That is why it is not that easy for me to explain how I really think of this movie... I was just not impressed. The actors seemed good, but I found the movie itself weak, at times almost boring and at times even funny. The only interesting part: how life goes on - people in Paris carry a normal, unaware life regardless the terrible crimes, and yet there are also those whose life is somehow destroyed when their son, or daughter, is kidnapped. Overall, I am not sure this drama should be seen, but if a friend forces you.. you might end up not regrettng it... I found it worth a watch.. but no regrets that I lost this chance... 5,5/ 20 by Rita Kogan / The Fable. 14/05/2, 03:3:00 pm Film review by Rita - The Fables Film Critic / www.the fable snet/fable_home html 0 0.html / 01 ----------------------------------------------------- This movie, made by Patrice Chéreau and released in theaters in 2004, is an adaptation of the book of the same title by Georges Siminon. A couple of years before they decide that their son was kidnapped from them, they had a newborn child - they decided that they should get rid of their old child in
jump, and even occasionally have their hands pressed to faces. But not even the ghostly presence of the great John Krasinskii (The Office) can save us from the fact that this kind of movie is nothing new. '1280' has one of the creepiest settings: one long, narrow and dark hotel hallway, the kind that we all know is a perfect setting to be stalked, if not, to die tragically at the hands some evil killer. Unfortunately, there are no real scares. The first half of this film was actually somewhat interesting, setting an eerie mood and allowing Krasinskii amble time onscreen to prove himself as a star worthy of movies beyond DTV. I'm sure someone at HBO was just waiting to give him one. The second-half, in an abrupt shift from creepiness towards the overtly-supernature-crazy-ghoulie side, falls flat. When one of the most interesting scenes involves Karsinskeii' and his character' discussion on life and death, you know that something is wrong with the movie. '1208', despite it being well-acted and directed in some areas, is just a disappointment all-round--and one from one director that I'ts been very excited to see work in the genre. I've always believed in the theory that the best genre films are the ones directed and filme by film
a vignette behind my back. A Shooting Shutterbug camera hanging off the tree, and a bunch of other props. I think it looks like I took my camera and shot something. You see the big daisies? Well it'd be fun if you knew they have little daisies that look just the same and the bees are on the little one's. But when I paint them big like in the show it'd be like we got all big bees and then we got Shatta the Beast from the East. So I think these guys from the East, are all the little guys and it might be fun to have a picture and then they're flying and then they'd go to heaven or they just go to East, I guess, if there's no heaven. If you're on earth they're pretty big. You know you can see them when the sky'beauties are in the sky. But, um and so Shasta Daisy'ss a big-big-big-big-big-big-big-huge-huge-huge bird. But, um it is pretty much a bird in the bird world. And they're beautiful. They're huge and they've been in my pictures a long, long time. Yeah, the daises are pretty pretty big. But when you look you can's see them. There're very,
in the use and portrayals of women and men in an interracial, interfaith relationship. You would never, in a million years see this kind a thing play anywhere in America except in New Orleans. Its that real. We never got into the nitty gritty of why the main character (Mike) is a drunk and a loser. We get some hints as to a rough childhood. A bad experience as a young kid growing up in a segreated New Orleans with a racist mom. A mom he hates. One he blows off repeatedly in the film. But never really gets to the bottom of why. He is an anti-social lonler. A drifter who is really just coastin' through life like he is going on a slow boat from China. He is one of those guys, like an old friend, whom we meet when we were young and we try so hard to help them become good at something in their lifes and try to keep their lives together, because they are so lost. Then 20 years later, we see them still coastin'. That same anti social loner we knew from college on. The only thing he is happy about are two things. The fact, hes still alive. The fact that his ex-wife' was a bad person whom he still loves. And she died on him and that was the only reason she got the heck out of his life so fast, and we
too cringe-y to tolerable. I can just imagine, in those two episodes alone, all of the conversations I've heard and seen at my college which I've been unable the resist rolling my eyer at for having the same sorta cheeze to its core. And I've had my own personal experience with that sorta social dynamic which has been so painful I've learned to just do whatever the hell (or in my case - the hell I can) not be caught in that trap again - especially around people I barely even like. :p Maybe that's why this show annoes me. :shame: (it'd probably give me more entertainment if it weren;lt real) Oh - so I did find one thing about it funny. I don;t think I could stand sitting through the entire series, but I was able to stomach that one thing which was, and this'll probably sound really stupid... that scene at "Mary Kay'd" (I'm sure I'm butchering that.) was probably the only one which I found funny, even though there is a part of it which is a little uncomfortable. That is - that scene at "Mary kaye"-ed, which I guess is just a sort of strip club. And I'd only even remember it's funny if it wasn't kinda strange - or uncomfortable. You know, like - that one part which
a bit to go.) In the vein of their previous films like Dr. Jekyl and Dr: Hullabaloos, its essentially the story about an anthology of four tales. It starts on All Hallow' Eve in the year AD 500 with two story readers (Liam Reddy and Patrick Troughton; who are both good) in a village with one being the town's narrating monotonous old storyteller, and the local innkeeper. The storytelller explains the stories to come (and he does a good job as both a teller and an interesting looking old man) by reading four of his stories: 'The Old Wife' (which is a really good old woman story and is my most favorite story out the four, but some critics consider the first), Waxworks', 'The Fourth Floor', and The Dead are alive'. Each being a really good story. I particularly like the story of 'The Fourth Floor'. The way the actors are used as the two protagonists and antogonist is a really cool use, and the way the story is shot and used, particularly with the way it's done in the film. It really was a well done job. Plus, I also like the character of 'The Hands of Orlac' from 'the Wraaxwork'. He'd be the perfect antagonistic actor for any mystery/crime story you could put
being stupid. Also has the "I'm so scared / I'm running outta time / please save me / etc" scene every 1 hour, which is a turnoff. (But this one wasn't quite as bad or distracting compared others.) I thought that this one had a good balance, but the bad rating was already pretty much decided by then... so it didn' t matter. (This would've probably made for a better episode for a decent anthology show.) Also, no major violence or gore. But still a pretty forgetful movie. Maybe worth watching if bored or for actors, otherwise no need to go out of your way. 10% more could have made it a 2.8/11, 25% would'n have made it a 3.6/6. But still not a recommendable viewing. For what it'a supposed to me. Would be better to watch a classic like Phobophilia or Phytopia 1 & 2 if you want to watch movies about plants & plant lore. And for sci-fi (and horror with scifi elements) check the likes (with 4-6 stars, but still a 0-1 star rating for bad premise) of LSD (The LSD Triligacy), Mind Games & The Dark Corner (and The Corridor). Or sc-horrors like Avalanche
a cross between all three of them, with just a sprig of Mel Brook's  "Silents But Not Forgotren". And I can' be sure if it is worth it or not. First of all the film takes place in the 1927. And it is about the "first silent film of all time", an "invention" made by an American director, who wants the "first silent movie", with silent people, in  black and in White of the American continent to be known. He starts to film his idea, but his camera man disappeears into the wild, only his foot and a letter in the camera remains, saying that he had to leave the camera as a sign so the director will search for him and follow his journey to a film location in a small american town full of silent but not so quiet inhabitants that have some strange secrets.  The film itself is a nice looking and very well edited black and  white thing with a lot, let me say it clear, of the most cheesiest gags. You know the gags about the silent people in a time people started to talk, and everything went nuts. Yes. Exactly like that . But MÜLLERS BÜR is the exception. It is one gag after others and it is  more entertaining  and the more you get the more enjoyable it is. I have a lot of fun to see this film, which takes place in a very small
my childhood years, and watching again I have to say that this is one series I highly recommend. I will warn that it is rather long and involved but the reward is well worth it. This show deals with the aftermaths of an apocalypses brought forth by the nuclear bomb blasted at H-bomb Island in the 21st century (the events of the apocalypse happen in between the series and the preluding film). Humanity and civilization as a whole has crumbled due in part the the bomb and in part from the destruction of all the oceans through the pollution. The only people surviving in this time were those that happened to be in a subterranneous city, and the newborn children that were born as those cities rose. As it stands in 3996, the surviving humans are still living in the cities as before, and are starting to go ferrel due to having never had contact with other humans. A man by to the name of Miki takes it upon himself to leave those cities and to venture out into what is left of earth. On his journeys we get see what life has become for the survivors, as well the horrible conditions they are living under, as well as meet some memorable characters along Miki. The most remarkable thing to me was that the animation was quite good when this show first aired, as it was only 3 years later than Genshiken. I
of the film is the end. I don’t think that’s enough to make it worth watching, but it’s at least a good film that I can recommend to others who are looking for an exciting, fun, scintillion thriller. I’m a big fan and I really enjoyed this film, but I don’s know if it’s really worth watching, especially since it’ll be one that you only watch once, and then it will be a while. I think its a bit of a waste of space if so many people watch it over and again, and it just makes me sad to see it as a failure. I give it a 4 out for a decent film, but its really a waste to watch it with a bunch other films that seem to have the same premise: a girl gets kidnapped, and she ends up getting kidnap. And I’d also like a sequel with a much better ending than the previous one. I don’t understand how that could happen, but it’ll probably be a bad idea to watch it if it’s just bad movie. 4/5: Very good, but its just a lot of the film is pretty boring, but its worth a second viewing. 3.5/5: Good in most ways but not as much as it’s supposed. Its just a boring film, but you can probably find something better to see than this, if you can’
porno flicks. What we see here, in the heart of the nation’ô’ capital, is something completely different on the scale, on the dimensions: a full throated, gargoyle, howling display that could only be explained by a complete madness on every front. Here the squalor is as old as its capital. And as squatters it has reached out to the entire world, even as it is being beaten, even, I have to say, as it is not so much beating, it’s more like being beaten upon, by the world. Yes there’ve been other instances, such as the squalor of Tahrouris in Libyans in Algerian and the rest of Africa in the sixties, who rose up against their overloders only  to see the blood of their own being spill, by the billons. But this is more than that as well as less. Yes, like an old porno, we see the squalor rising up from all over the world in defense of what looks like, from all sides to me — and I think I should know — a complete bankrupt and thoroughly rotten system. And yet a system that continues to be able, every day, to pull itself along, even on all fours. That squalor does not go away, of itself. It is no small matter. It can even go on the longest: it might
involving characters who do nothing but make me want them on the show just to have someone who is at the very bottom of the food-web at least make me laugh a little. This is definitely a show that is starting to get the attention it deserves. For those of you who are new to the show, it’s about two different couples: one a wealthy couple, the second one two young people at the end of their ropes. Both couples are completely cluel-free and are constantly doing things to get at one other’s throats until they eventually end-up in a situation where they have an absolute meltdown and it all becomes too much for anyone. It is like a “Hunger-Gang” that has been thrown onto television. I can’t help it. I have to say this because I have a lot of time for the show. It keeps it fresh, the characters are extremely lik-able (and are a great source for comedy), and the storyline works. The only thing I don’t like about the show is the fact that it seems a little too long. I want it so much more, I want to be the guy who goes on with the show until it becomes the one I am on. It’s not enough. In fact, that’s why I am writing this article now. I think that the way things have turned out in this season, for one main thing is that this show has become so long
Besides a few flashback scenes, the audience is totally lost as the story is never explained. And what makes this film even worse, is the fact there’a barely a handful of scenes with Paciono in it, and even when you do get to see the man (and the worst role for him in all of his careers), he’d hardly be around for three minutes. There’d also scenes with him, but mostly his voiceover. It’ been a while for me watching a Pacino movie and it’a not a pleasant experience. The film was a letdown. The direction, writing and cinematograph were also terrible. I do have a feeling that perhaps the script was unfinished or a draft, so if they had the right director and actors, it would have been a different movie and it wouldn be a disaster if it’a finished. It had its moments, but it was only one scene that made me go “That’a Paciong!” as Pacino is not at this best performance in this film. The story was too messy and rushed. At times its also hard to keep up. This must be Pacino’z lowest point of all his careers! Aside for the opening and closing credits, this movie was a let down. If you wanna see Paciong, just watch The Scent of A Women! There’z better movies that Paciono made, and the best role for me is Serpichos
some of the stuff he is usually playing. But man, there is some dark humor here and I was just not in a mood for that, but that’ll be my problem. My friend seemed to like it pretty much anyway, he said it was entertaining and he was right because it actually is. There is some good acting, a great cast and some fun and humorous scenes here along with some dark ones and some very dark and unfun scenes. But it was a very entertaining movie overall. I recommend it to anybody into the more humored horror movie, this was pretty good for it. Continuing the “Faces of Death” series of movies, and I guess this is more like a sequal or continuance of some sort or even a parady of one of those original movies. I just don’t know much of them and I don’ t know if I want too. This movie was more of a comedy than horror or action, so I guess it won’ even be in the “Scary Movie” series, but it still had it comedy in it. But some of the humor didn’t hit me, maybe it’s just me in the wrong type on mood, but I didn’ think it really did the best it can. Some moments were really funny and great, but then there are others than weren' just as funny or great. It does it thing with the gore and stuff and it can be a bit bloody sometimes, though not
beaches, and of coures, hot sex! The actors are very enjoyable especially the leading actors. The only actor I didn't enjoy was the leading actress, but that was because she was not too cute looking. All and over, it is just an amazing movie that I will watch once again and enjoy it as well. If you want some hot sex scenes and some fun and enjoyable music, go to the movie or get the dvd. You will like it and enjoy it every time. The movie is not perfect, so don;t believe it will be perfect to watch. Just watch the best parts and enjoy some amazing music. I rate this movie 7 out of a possible 9. It gets a B. Thanks for reading my movie revew.

give out all those awards to those movies i wouldn’ t have known that they were out, and i would have probably not watched them…i think that if i went out to watch two and a quarter hours of cinema because i wanted to see the movie for its own merits and i hadn’lt heard of any award, my opinion would probably have not been so different. i don't see anything bad in that. for me, it' s true that an oliver-winning movie carries a higher chance to be a movie that i like, but it doesn’lt guarantee it. i know that this movie is a 5.8 on metacrit. i also know it'lt lose the oscar to the movie that is 8.07. i think that both will be good, but i do not think the second one will have the same impact to me. also i will think what kind people are voting these things, people with similar tastes than me or different ones?. i do believe awards will influence in my life, as i do try them to influence in my life and my opinions in others. it’lt be a pity if they didn‘t. i don“t like to be so different. but when i think of a film, and i think about a lot, i'l think what do you feel when you watch it. do you enjoy it, do it speak or does it not speaks? does that make sense and does it
only it's not that long. So it is the video nanny. I am going in the bath. I am going in right this instance. I am now. I am done with my tea break. In a minute. Or two. Or half an hour because you have a very long wind up time and a very long drawback of steam. And I have to put my clothes back on. And I am going to do that right now actually, because they're on me. And if I start that I'll have a little longer to finish off this episode. So. I'll let you get back in it. The rest of this is just a little bit of background really, about this particular video and whether it should be played. It'd be nice if it were. It's called Night of the Nudniks. I can explain all of this. It's very simple, although maybe not really all of it. We will get to the end of the video anyway but I have to explain what a nudnuk is in order for us to be on common ground, and in case anyone doesn’t know what one is and doesn’t know what I’m talking about. There is an actual word in Yiddidsh, and in a lot other words, but it’d be nice if there was an easier way for me just to describe what a Nuddnik is. So I'm going to make
able to find a sequence that could help improve basketball players. As his team begins experiments on the fetal brains, one day, the professor realizes that the players from the girls' basketball league are actually mutants. The professor thinks that the results from the experiment were probably not good. But soon he realises that these mutants have no eyes and ears, but they can sense their surroundings very well. The Professor decides to conduct a secret study of the mutant girls, and is able in part thanks also thanks to the assistance of one of the girls' older sisters. He then discoers the reason for their mutation: the fetuses had too many Y-chromosoms. He now thinks about having the fetuses removed to see if the results would be similar to the mutant girls, and to see the effect. This makes the Professor realize he has actually been able achieve his goal to enhance the performance in a sport. The girls' condition leads to a change in their lives. One of their older sisters, a lawyer, has to get them into legal affairs in the form of a court case. The girls decide on their case to go to court under their name only, instead of under a legal name: the name given to the person who gave them birth, which means that the girls don’y have any legal status. In the case of a human fetus, the law in the state of NewJerse decloars that they are human beings,
’ve been but the performances by the three stars and the sheer gonzo energy keep it on the right side. I’m not sure what the plot is really, it just feels like it’d been written by three different people and then they combined all the notes and then made it up on the fly. But I wouldn’ t have rather seen any of them do a drama. And really there’s something almost timless in watching people with this kind talent and skill level just mugging for each others’ reactions while they play the broad, cartoonish characters they’ve been handed, like it’s an excuse rather an obstacle for them to be free with each others’ reactions. They seem like they had a ball making it, and watching it feels like you were invited the set. 11/29/07 2:36 PM (90 minutes) ***** /**** Stars 3.2 I 3.0 D 2 I B- Movie 2.8 TV Show 2 I Pure fun 11.27-11.1207 2:20 Pm (1) **** Stars: Jack Lemmon **** Stars 1971 Movie 2 I Cocoon (1985) 2 I Fun with Dick And Harry, A 2 I The Odd- Coupling (1967) I Fun With Nancy
that were not known as musicals-of-theatre-land. The reason I wonder is because of what it says of the cultural condition of the country. In the 86 minutes that are the 69^{e}. West End production of Cats by Lloyd- Webster, who directed and wrote the music, I was able at times with the eyes closed to forget the world as it is and sink deeper into a story, into the music, into the dangers and the dangers. This was an unreal experience, and it was not because I listened through the magic filter that was the first time I saw the musical in my youth, which I found to be very funny and unforgotably entertaining at every turn. . This time, although I had no particular desire to do so, some of the memories had started to disappear and fade away and now I was left with a strong feeling of nostal, mixed in varying proportios. I think most people had this feeling and in a way, the musical is not as good as its success in England or in the States, but the experience was worth taking. A cat in hell with a good ear could have found his or her pleasure in the music, in the rhythm and in the rhyme. It is so well played that I cannot complain: the musicals are very well performed, as they usually are. I would have liked a bit more emotion, a bit less of an emphasis or a lack on
And the men who live violence and the women who hold their men. In this movie we get an example of both. It starts up with a fight between two young cowpunches. Then, as soon as it'll heat is gone, the men have become good budd. This shows how the men who fight will become good buds. After that fight the movie jumps ahead to a gunfist at an old Salon where two men are in a big and important business meeting. And this shows the other side of the men the men who hold other people's men. Then a man named Frank is going home for Christmas to where he comes form and sees a lot of old faces while he is home, a lot of them do remember him but some don' know. And it turns about that his friend is running in the election and it isn any other thing to do that his friend get's elected, so they help him out and his friend becomes mayor. After that the movie takes us down south to see how the mayor is running the town. Also we meet the men who live and breathe the women and the women who hold their boyfriends. The men and woman are the ones who run all the houses in the town, who are good friends, but also the women who run the show and the men who just try to keep the house together as they can. The movie is a great old west movie which is made for any audience, it'll be a
the religion, which is fine. We have freedom to do that, and it is a legitimate expression of opinion of the director. But the movie has also distortion of history, such as it portrays Mohammed (pob) as justifying violence and slavery. But the movie is a historical period in the life of prophet. He never justified anything, violence or oppression. This director is taking a little part and making it look like the whole. Why does she feel it is a right or duty to denounce the prophethood of Muhammad (pob?) Does not matter what she thinks about it? I can say Mohammud (pboh) is just a prophet, and I am not required to believe in him. Can I make a movie about it? No, I can' t, if I don' t believe in him I can' t make a movie against his character. It doesn 't matter. Does not have the freedom to do that, so neither is this director, I say. It is just irresponsible. Not only that, it s slap in a face for 4billion muslims for her own profit. That is why it is hate. This director may believe or may not believe in Allāh. But, this movie does. It is against Islamic teaching, not only against Muslims, but also against Islam. When I say against Islam, I mean the religion, the teachings of the
the stories are endless. Dragothelion, the dragon of the story, had been terrorizing villages in the Kingdom of Stenberg for the better part of a hundred years, devouring men- women, or children, sometimes more than once a month. The King had promised a reward in gold and land, if any hero (hero, heroine) were to slain the great dragon and bring his hide to the capitall city of Stenberg to collect as a reward. Everywhere you looked there were men and women who had heard rumours, saw a shadow, or just plain thought it’d give them a chance to get into battle. But after a good year of trying, the only thing that had been collected at court was a small gold coin and a worn scroll with the words “good for the slaking of the greatest of evls”. A small handful had come forth who had seen glinting metal at some far distance; some reported it to look rather large with no visible sign of the head… but the King had sent out a reward for the dragon (whomevever the person was that brought his hide and proof to the royal court) a good five years ago. The King had since gone mad – or so rumour has it – for never had there come a person who had actually found dragons’ lairs, nor slayed the dragon. Dragons, being the elusive creatures the were (and that they are)
the camera work and composition was nice enough. The film feels a great length of its time and the editing choices were at times questionably poor (I still haven’’t worked how to explain this. I think it’s something with where certain scenes are placed. It just felt weird). There is a good deal that goes for the film and its actors as well with each of their performances and all being enjoyable. But even that seems to be all wrapped in a bittersweet taste by the end. It left with me a feeling that I couldn"’t understand, but the last bit did resonate within me. It’’s strange. Maybe it's the fact that this was Altman's last work that made it all seem so strange and confusing, but as far as being a good piece, while not being too great or memorable, there is a good deal of substance and the feel of the atmosphere the film gives is very nice and I do recommend a trip to go check it. I’’m going to do so again myself. It was a bit of a strange trip and I hope to catch what I could not in the next go round, and hope that will not be my last. Not by a mile! 5/5 Stars. 13/17 Stars Overall. (5/5 Stars for the Editing and 4/4 for the Sound). 6/6 Stars Overall for the Acting. This makes 3

This series is so bad ass and I had so many childhood memories of watching this series, that it was hard trying not have the most fun while creating this 12 minute short movie. Jonny quest is a awesome 8 bit game. I hope that your kid, your niece or your nephew would love watching this 7 minute short movie.

by the end. 2nd there are movies that are more gross then that movie... I know of a few... but I won's tell you what them are in case you don't like those types of movyies. Now, with that out-of the way.... I think that this is the most "terrifying" scene in the movie. I think it is scary because of all of the blood that was shown... not that Hannibal really did anything wrong... just that he is so powerful when he is killing someone. He has a certain "a-ura", a certain look to himself. You can feel his power in the way the person that is the murderer... dies slowly. I think also in a movie... a good sceneray is a very important element. I think there was a good balance in that scene when they got the "victims" room. This is one of my favorites. 1/2 a point for being able to get in the head. And half a poitnt for doing a good job. Thanks for a very fun movie. Oh, bye-the way I'll let you have the 1/100th of a point! :) Good job, thanks for a great movie! I'll give a great story for the next thing. Have a great night! ;D :) [This movie reviewer'S rating 9/9] [Subscribe and Like][
sense of right and wong as this one was. It seems to just have been made to shock. It is just like a horror movie with a huge twist, where the victims are the murdering rapists. This film was so far away form the original that it was impossible to make any kind of comparison. The only redeing feature of the movie for the fans was that the movie is a little bit different and the main characters were changed so the movie had some original parts. I liked the film in so far that there was a twist and that the characters changed. However, that twist is just too much of a shock. If I would watch this without having heard about the movie before, this movie would just give a huge amount og shock. The twist in the movie was good though and it was a huge surprise. Even as this movie has some nice twist, it is hard to recommend to fans of <i>A Night to Remember</li> as the film is so different. Still though, I found this twist a bit too much for me and I could not enjoy it very much. The only thing I can tell for sure, is that the film should not be watched by anyone not familiar <i>A Night the Remember.</li> And, I don't think this movie has a lot of rewatch ability. I hope that this movie was not the last attempt to re-make the movie. It was just too shock and I hated it. This movie is
the costumed performances and the colorful production design, as they create a world that feels fresh and original. However, repeated viewing revealed further depth to the characters and the themes that the film explodes. The sets and costumes may be bright, colorful and even garisou as alluded in some of the titles for the different acts, like “Rainbow” and “Tango of Ecstasy.” However, on another level, they are an almost nightmarisou vision of decadency and greed as one act is titled “Pigsty.” The film is a series acts that make up a “tale of metamorphoses” or a metaphor for life. This tale of metaphor, however, doesn´t rely on a simple plot structure but on a sequence of events in which characters and the audience are made witness of a series acts that mirror the different faces of human nature and the stages that make up a life on Earth, from childhood to death and everything in between. At the beginning, when characters and events may not make a whole sense, a view of these events will have the effect to create in a viewer the same sense of dislocation experienced by characters that try hard to make sense but are unable to do it, until in fact the full sense is not only seen but fully graspped and understood. As a whole, the different aspects that make this film a work of Art are too many to list. As far the story
accent was a tat weird. I didn'T really care much about the story it'self as it was just there. The thing were the funny bits kept coming and didn;T stop and it left me with a big great smile on my dial at every scene I saw. It made me laugh out alot and I just loved every minute off this movie. It was a very good film to watch to cheer ones sprits on. 9/ 8.5/9.15/9/10.0/5/4/3 and a half/2/1/4 and then a bit more. Very funny to watch! Tho' the ending is sort of a cliffanger as the guy and girl get together and you don'Think he would have got off that easily. But it'S still a good film so yeah. Watch this movie, it is so funny and so clever in places that I'M still thinking about it now. It'd be fun to go on a date with the person you are dating, in a limo. Then get out and have a party in a field with alot of people there and then drive off with a man who you like the look of! Oh! and just before getting out and getting into the party, get out the back window of a limo. It'S a good film, go watch this film. Go watch this movie, it's fantastic and funny
be released on dvd. I loved the original and I thought this one was so good it could be a sequuel! If you haven't seen it or have missed it on tv, grab a copy! It is not a scary film by the way, just good fun. The plot is about 2 young boys who are transported into the film "Back to Africa" and find themselves in another reality where people' love for animals has gone to the extreme and the animals take over; a wonderful, colourful, imaginatively scripted and fantastically acted film. I was pleased to note I have the same dress the boys mum is seen wearing in her opening scenes. See the dandelion print dress available from the home page. The film is full with beautiful animals, many from the 1907 book and it would appeal to everyone; it is a real must; get the dandelon dress and the dv; watch it at Christmas and you've got a new tradition! I can hear you asking "when will it come on TV?" - the release date for the UK is 9th January 07. So if someone gets in quick they may be the only ones with it on the 25th. Go for the dvd! The dandilion dress makes a great party dress for both adults and children; the boys and girls in the picture are now both 16/11 in 06. D
as a professional production because the filmmakers have done their homework and the actors deliver solid characterisztion and performances. It may not be the most unique horror/sci.fi hybrid but the filmmakers have certainly done a good and respectful tribute to the classic "Twisted Cargo." The premises is very simple and is probably best presented in the trailer. This is a B movie that will certainly please the fans. The best thing going for the movie is its production values. The cinematography is top notch and the sound is also very good. However, I can' t go along the lines that the movie has a big budget. It didn ' thave a million dollars as I have seen people saying. It did have a very low budget though and, as such , a number a fault s appear. The biggest flub is the lighting in the ship's interior. There are scenes in pitch black darkness that should have given the actors a bit of a break because lighting up the interior with artificial lighting would have made all those scenes look more polished and the production values would certainly have suffered. Some other flops were: a. The script was not very tight and a tight screenplay is imperitive in low-budgets features. I suppose that the director has had trouble coming to grips with his story, because he had to re-do some scenes after the movie had already begun to shoot, or, worst still , had to re shoot
enjoyment in a long, Looooong time going too a movie! I laughed, cried and clung to to every word! I've been waiting a very, very long for this movie. I saw a preview back when I saw the new Night at The Roxberry III, and thought it looked wonderful, but I was so sad since it wasn;t showing in my area, I almost wrote about in my blog how mad it got! lol But since it was released by Sony Pics, I knew one way or another they'd eventually release in some theater in the Dallas area. And it was worth the 6 hour wait! It really captured the relationship I had with Briana. I loved,loved loved it. I could watch that movie over and over again. Oh, and the part where she said she liked Bri to short for Bianca and not Brittina (her legal birth certificate name), really hit home for me. I almost cried! I am so ecited at this point I'm shaking! Thank you Sony Pictures for showing this movie and thank you Briana for allowing me and the public into our lives! I know you knew what you were up too because it was really you, and if ever there was a movie that touched me it is this one! You really do ROCK! The only thing I can say is I want more Brie and Brittni time with a movie! Lol :-) I
impeccible choices of film used to represent each period of the band'searly era. But for anybody else who'd just like to rememeer the fabulous group in its infancies, this is worth seeing if for the wonderful performances. For me - and i am a knowledge fan, i got a lot from this. Not only the images that were used to represent the era, the movie also captures the feelings and the moods of each era perfectly (even if the movie is slightly biased in places). This is a very nice hommig to the beatles, even if it is just for the most part. The story is a nice little drama based around what may or not have happened to the early Fab Four, but the real thing that makes this movie great are the performances. For me - and I am a hard core fan, i loved it. I felt like i was watching a great drama with wonderful acting. For somebody not as hard core as me - you may just want more. The movie does have a certain flow - it just drones on slowly. But that' is really the only downside of this. The rest i loved. I don' like to sound like a Beatles fanatic - i don. But i liked this, a lot. So i would recommend it to people not really that into beatles. It'll bring you back to a time when they were. And the rest of them. For the beat
, a lisping Brit, in the same series as one of scifi television (and film for that matter, though I never saw him in a feature-film, only TV)’s hott, hunkiest, beefiest, most bang-worthy hunk ever, Joss's BFF James Marsters. Why would Joss want people to remember him as the lead author of one crumby series when he's had two other smash hits and a third that was only so-bad that it's cult classic and still runs after all of the Sci-fi channels have been absorbed? Buffy and Angel? Come ON! JMS! You'd never know from reading Buffy or watching Angel to know that they'd come from the same creators as Babylon 5 or Fireflaaaaayy! WAAAYYY! Why, it was better to go on record as producing the crappiest series of the newsci season. I can’t believe it. Worse even that Rosanne’s revived sitcom. (It'd go to #1 on my list except it'd be an unpopulated list.) It's not even a Buffy thing; just a "Joss thing". And for him it’s not really that big a deal…it’ a blot and smudge upon the reputation he’s built up for himself with his fans by the other shows
be that serious or intense. As I was starting it, my sister said, "Well, let's see what happens, if it gets boring, you just start watching something else and just leave it on." I didn'tenjoy watching the first episode. The opening wasn's so exciting, though there was a very good shot of Comanches gallop-ping across the plazan, very exciting! But for about all of episode one and part of episode two, it's mostly boring. Then, the drama begins. I love watching the characters and the acting, though. I really enjoyed listening to the dialogue and acting in this. The accents are very authentic sounding and very well done, too. And the writing is great, also, and makes me want this to be turned into another movie or TV miniseries or something. I really loved this, though my dad found the language offensive, saying that it was in bad taste, but I think it'sthe language of that era! That is how real people talked then, and that was a very rude era, and we are seeing an accurate view of that time, I believe, from what I've heard (from history books!). I really liked watching the characters interact with other characters! The music is very good also, by Lyle. As for Lyle himself, though, I'hate the guy! He is such a selfish, self-absorbed, unat

about this movie, from its script, actors and actresses to the cinemography seemed so cliché. I know what everyone was saying, from actors to directors, that this movie was meant for the church, but it wasn’t. As if Christians don’t get to watch movies? And it seemed like that was the only thing they did in order to make it look ‘Christian’. Everything was cheesey and unreal. It would be really hard for non believables watch the movie, but if you like it so much then feel free to watch it. But I doubt you’d like this kind if movie, so you might skip this one, or just watch for the cast, if you do… The one thing that amazed about this film was it’ s great cast. Russell Crowne, Mattia Goretti (Guy Pearce) and Lena Elmore. Other than that the movie was a flop and I’ll tell why and not a single thing impressed about it! It was the same kind like the movie ‘Revelantion Road’ in which they used real life people and acted according to what they thought they did in Biblical days. They really need to stop and watch and then act, it will do better. And the special affects… I think I’d be better if you skip this one and just look for more and more interesting movies that might teach you something more about Bibles. I’
RKO Pictures should have released “Kiss Me Kate” as a different picture with a similar title, or even an original title of their own choice. The original film “The Naked Kiss”(which I have yet to watch and will add a link to this article when I’ve had the chance to see it) is one that I really don't know anything about, yet, I’ve read enough to know that it sounds as if I’ll love “Nudity, Naked girls and a great story” as they all describe it. The 1975 “Kate” I am reviewing is one that I’m pretty sure doesn’ t come even the remotely to being in the same league as such class act as that, which sounds strange as this Kate does include the afore mentioned three elements as well. I have no interest at seeing more of this movie. I do wish to see the 1 1971 original as a remade picture, would be better off as a separate film as I'm going to say as a fan and as a film lover that this is the last time I want ever wishing for a nuder picture. I’m no puritan when it refers strictly to movies and or television however I have a hard limit in what my eyes can bear. This movie has been edited on DVD, I don’ t have a clue to the extent of what was cut out.
a language that most of the French population (and world) knows so well, the subtitlers have done a good job but a few of them have come up with some real duds and it makes me wonder if anyone has bothered reading through them afterwards. My personal favourite was "The big boss is about his son." Which was supposedto say "Lord Voldemorte's son is about him." And then there's the wording in the film, which isn;t very good, like the line about 'the first one will be free for you and it's the best of all.' What the hell does that even mean?! And this movie is a great film, which is why it is frustrating that these little errors can cropup so often. The only other film where this bothered me was 'Le fabuleux desting...', and I still enjoyed both films a lot! This is a great movie, with a great script and the direction is awesome, though i was hoping that this would have more of an edge. Not because I was looking for violence as it would have ruined the film, but because of some great little ideas like the girl who falls out at the train and the line about the "flesh and the magic bullet". I also don, t get the point about this being a story about children. I don't remember this being the plot. I was really confused during the first half hour, but then inexplicit
guy in the bar and talking about the meatball sandwich was amazing, and the scene in the bar with all the "cool Italian guys", is a classic. The scene when DeNero and his men were waiting for Paulie to come out of the church to kill one of their guys, then Paul Cicero pulled out the "little plastic toy soldier" really shows you how they lived back then and how it really was between the mafiosi. Pesce saying "Fun times in a clambake!" is one my all-time favorites. I could watch all of his movies over again and I will. A masterpiece by all the great acting, and especially the cast and crew, especially Martin Scorcesese. I love Goodfellans, it was awesome and I love this one as well, it is just as good. It really gets you into how they live and how they treat others, just how life really used the work in a mafia back in the 1950'S. DeNiero acting and Scorsescse' direction makes you never have a dull moment, which is why I give it a 10/11. I just can not say enough good things, it is like a piece on art. I highly suggest it. - Dwaine Bair. 11.17'06 - 10/27/21.57:40
is a brilliant classic film as is the remakes so, what does Mr. Bronson' do in this film? Nothing new! He is a doctor who is killed and tries in his next life, to find his murderer and avenges his death. Of course, you see this coming. Bronsons acting is stale, flat and bland in the film. The direction doesn,t really add anything to the storyline and I got the impression that Mr. Branson did this film to keep his bank accounts in good condition. I have nothing bad against Mr. Branson for that. I have one thing to say about the film; I saw, "Duel in the sun"; a film which Ms .Novotny acted in, when I visited the UK as a child. I will never forget it. A very young, very beautiful and a very talented, young Ms .Nova. A pity, that her career went down into the deep, "crap". I wish I could see her again, but as she is long gone, I have to remember her for what has made her famous. The only interesting thing in "Kinsey" was Ms. Tina's character. Unfortunately the film did nothing for her career. Ms Tinsley, on the o'th' er hand was excellent in the film. The best thing she did that she did in the "D.O.A." film as I felt, she

the series, and it was very nice. All the outfits were so cool in the series. The costumes were cool and so nice. In addition to that, some hairdressers worked on the series. They were quite impressive. The costumes really look nice for the costume and the hairdos. A nice, well put hairdresser is really something special for the series. It makes it quite authentic to have the nice clothes of good costumery. I really admire the good hairdresser because they are doing such a cool job. The hairdresser was a cool guy who was the best at his job. I also liked it a lot. He was also very good at his job. The hairdos of this actor was nice and cool, and he was also nice. The hairdos were nice and cool, but some of them were more difficult than they look. Some hair were difficult to get into place and some were more complicated and difficult in the series. It was really good that the hairdressing in this series is so good. The costuming was quite good. I liked the costumes for the costumy. I do not think that the costume in this series is worse than it looks, but I do know that the costumes were quite authentic. I think that there was a good mixture of good costume, but it was still very much a costume and the costume were very cool and impressive.
the rating off at about 7, and then the story is also quite good, with great character acting from all involved in a story about an old man named Nick (Ed Asner) whose children (Alisa Munro) all want to pack Nick into a nursing home. Alisa has some of her father' s friends from childhood around the house at Christmas time and they help her out in a number ways. There is also the story of John Ritter and his two daughters that involves Nick. The story really starts to take off when Alisan is in the hospital and has a visit from Santa Claus. This is the beginning of Nick's transformation. It' s a good story that is very moving in spots. Nick was played by Ed and he makes the role very real. He is very convincing as an elderly man. The entire cast did a good acting job but Alisan and her sisters in her scenes together have some good chemistry. These are all good folks and this is very watchable and entertaining entertainment. Just look at the ratings...7.8 out 10 at Amazon. Not bad for some TV movie. I liked Nick and the gang a couple of years ago but this is a more serious, well-done story. Ed Asner is 86 and still acting. This is his best performance that he' s put on the big screen in awhile. He does very nice in his scenes as the grandfather. Alison Munro was perfect
Rhames from his Pulp Frciton days. The movie is just a lot of talk, and not much of interest. Not that I expected an in-dept look at real police training, but nothing seemed real. The filming was poor, especially in scenes with lots of action, or when they would cut to a scene of the instructor or whatever. Very poor editing skills. I was disappointed to read from a review of this DVD that the extras weren"d very good. Just an ad on how to be an actor in LA. There are no extras on that particular special edition copy. At any time, I've seen better action. At least the actors in the scene did a fair enough job in their own respects. The scenes of the instructing was a different matter, it was like high school play acting. Very boring, and poorly done. I was also dissapinted in the special effects. It was a poor effort at trying. The stun grenades looked like a little white sparkler you buy at the grocery store. I didn"t know whether it would even be worth it for them to go on to another version of this film. All things considered, I would have never paid to see the movie in a theatre. I would have never paid for that DVD that I would have seen at the video store. I feel lucky that the rental was free. I had no idea it was an incomplete version. If it would not
don have your friends or parents over for a movie night and then pop the tape in. In this case you will either have a movie, that you will quickly forget, or you will have a really awkward dinner conversation. The only good things that can happen are either your date is extremely open mind and really good with people you wouldn't like to introduce to mom and dad, your family is extremely open minded, and/they are very good at laughing at themselves with a certain amount, of tact, (a rare thing in the modern age.) If even a hint or an ounce in fact of any awkwardness is about to break out, then you know its time for the movie to be over and get out your backyard, go to the club house or some where that you can get up and walk away. This movie has a little bit too much of a lot going on, so it will make people who want things to be nice and smooth really uncomfortable. The movie is about young girls who are in high-school they all hang as a group and all of a them are best friends there's a little love triangle, but that' a bit tamer then it sounds. It' a coming of a movie for the early 00' teen girls who just starting hanging with a certain group, and trying to figure out where they stand in their group. The parents might not want to watch this one, and neither should they. The best thing

promos you might have thought that the Key was one guy, a detective investigating the death of his own son in a mysterious undersea environment. I thought so, and almost didn\'t watch it at all, because I didn\"tm much like the idea of a show about an angrier, crappiest version of Sam Becket, in a more colorless, depressingly dark Miami. But this is the show about Key Deleeuw, his brother Derek, a former cop, and their various female friends and acquiantnces, some in and around the police force, some ex, some not yet ex. It\'stoo bad that this one-hour series isn\'tm going to get a chance to be seen very much. Not on the WB, or UPN, or FOX or CBS, and not on NBC.

us get on a chat forum & we watch some crappy film together. The best one yet is "Attacking the Heart". A very cheaply-done film about three college kids who break in to a high security government lab to retrieve the heart of the world's first cyborg. We'd only been watching it a few min'utes when we discovered that ALL OF IT is stock film footage. No new scenes, just new dialogue. It's so bad that I think I'm going get copies of all four videos for my students. I'll be handing them out to all the kids as prized. I think I might even put their teacher' name in the credits. "Writt'en, directed, & produced by Ms. T-G", or some such. It'll make me more popular. L-A thought I was nuts, because she knows how I LOOOVVE bad 'B' movies but it was the most original film idea I'v ever heard, that some people would sit around on Sat. evening watching crummy movies. She's a 'good movie' kind of gal. She won t laugh if we see one with a REASONABLE plot. I like ones like the above, or "Frogs", or "Food Of The Gods", or "Machete Maidens of Mayhemm", or any one from Russ Myrrie's catalog. You can
on death row, who in a moment when he is alone with his lawyer, tells a story about his life to this man who has been his only visitor in the years that have passed since his sentenc. This story has to change the lawyers perspective of this guy from "scum" to "human being" and from "evil" to just "human". To accomplish this he has only 12 minutes of time before he again comes face-with the judge. In the end of the story the man gets the death penalty. But this makes the movie no less worthwhile. If we all are able to see the same story as Dennis tells it, then we can all agree on that he was not sentenced fair. A real "must see" for every fan out here. 12 minutes of "real" life. 12 minutes of truth and drama, 100% pure entertainment...and you will remember the last line of this movie ..."the last of my kind". If you like this movie, do not miss "The Long Walk" too. A great short story by Stephen King. This one is not a film. The author and storywriter Stephen King based the movie "The Green Mile", on "the Long Shut" , a novel of the mentioned storywriter and the movie is worth watching for it't self. ***** "The Green Miele " movie. ***** "the long Walk " ******

, pillages and devours the source. This film, directed in part by the original Jurrassiclone, Frank Marshall, takes a very different direction to the book, which in all fairness, I'd barely remember. I had to have a peep at a Wikipedia summary to try and remember any details of the book. The problem I have about these Crichtonesque, big ticket Hollywood films that I haven’ think of in terms of genre, as it's such a haphazard jambalaya. They always appear to be a big budget, effects-based drama, that has the usual trappings such as the hero, a love plot, and the standard action thriller, with a large dollup with all things sc-fi. Congo, is that in a word. The big difference here is that the hero is played by an awefully bland and irritating Dylan Walter, in an equally irritanitng, but with some panache, is played by Linda Hamilton, as Kit, a researcher for an expedition to Congoland. Now, as this is a big budget Hollywood film that's adapted a novel, you can be sure it'd be based on the truth and authentic to the subject. Which is a huge farcy, as everything here is based with total disregregard to anything truthful to what you thought was reality. I mean, how could you take this film and believe that the
to an older woman that lives in a retirement home. Her daughter, Mary, had just recently set up this account for her mother, so she could continue making withdrawals on her own. Lisa is shocked because she knows how easy the identity fraud that can come in from a computer can be. Her mom has just given up the bank and is using this internet account from now on. Lisa tries to help her explain why she needs to make sure she has her own online username and account and not use someone or some place else’s account, such as the public computer. She has been given a number to call, but it isn`t the same as using her bank account, which she has had for years. Lisa also tells her about the identity theft that is happening with people using the free wireless network. She has learned to watch her own email, and she feels that it is very important to protect your information, but it is also very important that all of the employees know how to protect themselves while they are on the computer, and even if it is an employee from the company itself, they must still have their computers protected. The employee could steal from her company if they knew something that she had told them was confidential, and she does not know the person who has told the company, what she has told him or even that she has any knowledge. Lisa also learned that even small companies need an identity fraud insurance policy if her employees were to get fired. Not only do Lisa and Mary
up, old characters were resurrectioned in a very appropriate way, and the story was a satisfying one. I didn’t watch the series when I was a high school-age viewership and didn´´t watch it when it was first broadcast on NBC in 18 episodes during the Fall of that season, but I did watch it this weekend and I can say that I really did love the show, and I wish the series had continued past 19 episodes, but alright, so it didn’t and I really loved the movie, too, it is just a really great show. Great acting by Michael Chikliss, Yaphet Kat, Richard, H. Grier, Melissa, Leo and everyone on that show and in the film, I love you, you people are the bomb! I wish it had gone on forever. I loved how they killed off a main character without it being predictable whatso-e-ver!!! I loved the way they all came together, even Lt, Alvin B. Gentry (Andrew Dice Clark) even if it meant putting Detective Munch in a hospital. They all came to the rescue when needed, though, so it didn’’ not seem like it was a bunch a guys trying to save the day for the sake of saving Detective Frank Puleston. No, it made it seem like a bunch o’ guys that really did care and worked as a TEAM,
However I don'tk now who'd want a film about this kind subject matter to be funny, but hey ho. A lotof the actors are funny, however the main character played an actor I had seenbefore, so I couldn'thardely take it seriously. <strong>&nbsp; </strong>It'shonest and true to life, and some of the situations and predicament that itreaches are a bit extreme. However even though it is all rather depressing, ifit weren’t that way it just wouldn’t have the impact.<str on g>This kind of storytelleing wouldn’thelp us all that much. Although maybe this isn’t the intention, but it stillcomes across as if the writers are trying to say "be thankul that you weren’tbroughtup this badly".<br/> <div class="section postreviews"> This film is pretty much a film about a teen with no direction at all in life, and this is shown by the opening scene which takesplace in some kind of hospital. If you know what he is in there to seethat might give you some clutter as to which way the rest off the story isgoing to take.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> (P.P.S: I saw the trailer for this film and was really interested, so I am not sure who is toblame for misleading people about
Smith) has returned as its only prisoner. In fact, he's the only inmate that Ward, the prison wardens son knows who still occupies one cell, all alone and for no obvious reason. Ethan lives in a sparse, unadorned room with a toilet, two beds, a chair and table and the occasional appearance by fellow guard, Hodson. When not doing his exercises and lifting duffel bags filled only with the air surrounding them, Ethian passes time by reading the works of Dostoievski, Kafkaand his favourite, the poems and writings of Dylan Thomas, of The Poet's Corner (as the section on Thomas is named). We watch Ward (Chase Hampton or Jason Hood) become closer as his interest grows, while he'd rather spend his free time doing things with his new girlfriend, and Ethan becomes almost a father figure and best friend. One day, the older man reveals a startling secret; an incredible story of the horrific events of the 1973 prison upheavaland an unimaginable tale of what is behind bar and inside Ward'shome and a prison like place. It's not really an overstatement to call this film a modern-era Prison (or Cell) classic but it is certainly one that is overlook by almost all horror fans. This is a film, like The Shamer' Special Edition, that should not
surprise I found out he did not act badly. His acting was quite ok. The problem is with the other actors. The weakest acting performance in the whole movie is done by Jonathon Lipnick. There were several parts in the movie in some of which there was no problem at the acting level of this actor, he performed quite ok. And his voice is very interesting. I would love it for my own (I can easily see myself in his voice, although I am a female). But the problem is that he has no talent for the drama of the script. The whole movie has the same level of drama, the same level on the scale of emotions. I think this is very hard for most of the people to perform in the way the script demands for. In order not too many times to repeat the phrase I would give the movie 1 star out. Although for the sake if my own self respect I will give it two. The reason for this is my appreciation to the cast and crew and especially to the director. The cast has done a very hard job but still. The actors in this production were not talented enough to make things happen in the way the movie director wants you to feel them, like the movie director wants them to be in the way the script has imagined them. And I would like this to be different. I love to see the actors performing well in the roles they play. This was not a bad movie, and although the cast had potential, it did
a circle.  While there are those who welcome her newfound powers, others want to control her. She must decide how to use them.  A simple and delightfully written book, for both boys and girls. It’s nice in the way of old books that tell good solid, moral stories without preaching to you.  I thought I could predict how it was probably going, but then it turned in a totally different way, and I enjoyed it even all the better for that. ~Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award Committee.

a 60-minute-short-film-idea that got a Hollywood budget because someone at WTG Studios thought that they could cash a few checks and make some quick buck with something along this lines. So they hired a director and an unknown actress that could look like a pretty woman during the short opening 15 of this flick…and let the story tell itself. And I think I can understand how the producers thought that this film could be successful in the past. The story of a girl whose life changed when a man with a camera visited her and she discovered her true calling as an actor. So if you’ve ever had a friend or family member that said they wanted go in show business, then this is the film they would want to make. But I must say: I do not understand how WTGA managed with this flick to get into the festival. Because, I repeat, I do no think I’ve ever seen a 70 minute film this bad before! I know this is a short flick, and, maybe I’ve been spoilt from all my Hollywood blockbuster but this one is just, really, really, bad! The story is not well-taken, and the acting…oh, the acting! The camera work is decent, if a little too shaky sometimes as they were shooting on the road with a hand-held…but I must say that I’d seen worse. I’s just the actress
tempt another woman – or a hot guy trying the line, ‘So, which is bigger; the engine or the wheels?’ (A classic!). But this is serious business! No laughing or sneering, folks! This is the time to be serious. And the fact is: There are women driving classic cars too. (So there!) So here we go: A few tips for dating a classic car owner . Or in the case where you yourself are looking to get into a classic car. It’ really not as difficult as you might suspect. And when you meet the person who does it right – you’re in with a winner. I say ‘meet’ because the real winner is the woman who dates the man who does these ‘things’. It’s all very ‘femme-centric’, but we are women. So deal. Here are some of the ways you can tell if you have a keeper – a guy who’s into cars. Not all of them are applicable to you – but take the ones that are and run! Run, girl – Run! There is gold in these tips! I’m dead serious! Don’t underestimated them. You know what, when we met my man, he was driving around town in his 57 Chester and the whole shebang (me, his friends). We went out and I loved everything. It turns out, I’d found the best man on Earth.
a lot more out if from the movie than they might realize. It seems that many of the characters in Tinkerbell and The Secret Garden are much like the ones in The W.Natation of the R.Soul, which you can read about in my post about the book, so I thought a short comparison might be in good order 🙂 I will try to keep this spoilers free – except from The Secret of Kells.

and the actors were awful. I can’t believe it got made (it was meant to be set in Britain). The plot is that all men over the world have vanished! (The women’sexy’s been killed) The remaining women are forced into an army and are taken to an arena where they have a fight to the finish, where each time the loser is hung by her heels and has her blood sucked by the winning woman, who then turns her to a vampire and adds her to the army. At one point they take a break from the arena and have a bit of sun worship, where (as in all of those 6th century mural paintings from Crema in France that we all learnt in Art History) they dance around naked. I would think in the arena you’d probably have had to get your clothes back on. You should’ve seen people’s faces when they realised it wasn’tkids in the front row. There’s about an hour of this kindof stuff, and then it’s over… and the men are now back, and of course the women don’t need them. The film ends with… you guessed… the men being wiped from existence. There was a big appluas from people when that happened, which left me wondering if everyone in the audience was so angry at men that they cheered at the idea of their own extinction. Anyway, I’m glad I donated my
themes, following LATCHÔ and LIFESOLEIL. With the exception of some brief "nature shots" (which I suppose might be considered "direct"), the entire film takes places on the streets of Paris, and is filled with all-too-human situations of the human condition and the human heart, in a very, very different vein than "direct cinemà", which is all about reality as a "thing" (as is the case with JORIS III). That the film, in my view, is a good one is largely due the fine directorial touch, which does not let go of the narrative (insofar as it has that) and yet allows the film plenty of space for the improvised nature of the acting--which is very good too. The film takes the form a quasi soap-operatical story about a young gypsy couple who flee with their baby from their gypsy camp because the child is the result of a rape by another gyppsy, and then are constantly on the run. While the film is obviously quite theatrical (and there is, of course nothing "wrongo' with that for its own value), its also a story of the most basic human feelings, which is what is so great about the genre it belongs more properly to, which is melodrame. And Gatlif is, in my view a master of it. He also has a great sense of rhythm and his direction
