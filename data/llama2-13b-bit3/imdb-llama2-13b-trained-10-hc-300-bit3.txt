. If you like this sort of movie you will love this movie. If you don’t… well, you won’ t, but you should see it anyway just out out of respect for what a well written and directed movie it truly was. The movie is a little slow paced, and it’ ll never be nominated for an Oscar for “Motion Picture,” and “Best Director,” or even, “Best Actress”, because those are reserved only for movies with explosions and gunfire, and lots of special effects. If that is what you are looking for you will be severely letdown. This isn’ t a movie about explosions, but about the explosive events, and the explosions they cause, in our lives when the people who love are taken from our world. It will also be one hell of a cry. I don''t care who you think is a macho man, this is a movie about death, about loss, and about love, and about the pain those three emotions can cause. I don’ t think I have ever cried so much in a movie since The Last Pictureshow. It is a beautiful movie, and one that will leave a last impression in the mind of anyone that is lucky enough to see this little masterpee… sorry… peice. I am sure it won’t be a hit in the theaers, but when the DVD hits stores I am sure it will sell by the
the same scale as the original film makes a huge difference. This is one film that you can watch over a few days and not feel as much as you did with it. I think that this movie will go down in history for the way it was made, as well as its message. I am a big fan and will be watching it again. If I was going to see it in cinema, then that would be a must. It is a movie I will be watching in the future, and will probably be one of the greatest movies of the century, and I think it is a film that will go down in cinematic and cultural history. I am glad that people are getting to know about this film, because it will be a classic for years to come and it is definitely worth seeing at least once in a life. I will be watching it again. I will be recommanding to friends and friends of friends. The movie is a classic for the ages, but I am a little disappointing. The acting is good, the story is good, the characters are great. I think it is a great story. The story was told by a great storyteller, and the story itself is a classic. I think people will see it and be impressed, because of how well it was told. I think that it is a great movie, and it was worth it to me and I think everyone who sees the movie should be able to appreciate that it was a good film
isn' t a disappointment. I loved the story. The acting. The special effects and especially the soundtrack. I have never felt the music was an important part in a movie before but in this one the sound is a character all its' own. This is a must see for anyone with kids, and if you like a good scare this time around you'll get one. The story is very original. The only thing about the film that was a let-up from it was that it was a little short, which I can only hope means a sequel. If it doesn ' t, it was a very short wait. I give this one 5 out of a 5 stars! This is a good movie. I'll be looking for the DVD soon! I can see myself seeing this one at least 4 times. This is a movie that will keep me busy. I can't wait for the DVD to come. I can't wait to buy a copy of it to show my kiddos! This is one of the best movie of all time! This is a movie that everyone should see. I have watched this film 3 times, it' s my second favorite film! This was a very funny and scaring movie. I loved the special effects in the beginning when he was in the car and the way he was driving in front of the house. It was a funny and funny movie. I loved the movie
Italy, a group of young women are terrorized by an unknown kinky killer in black leather who stalks the countryside on the hunt for fresh blood. As the bodies begin to stack up in this small community the locals turn on one another as the police try to catch a clue as the murderer continues his killing sprees. This one is well acted and directed with a great cast, including Edwige Fenech who plays the local beauty. The plot twists and turns and there are several shockers along the line. This was an early example for the Italian director to hatch some of his ideas about the dark side of the human nature which was to be seen in his later and better known gore-fests, like City and The House of Clockwork Witches (aka The Ghosts of Spooks Castle, 1879, The Demons or Demonia). A very enjoyably blooding horror film. (Matthew Lee) 6/20/21. This review was posted on IMDb. 1/3/22: This review was added to The Horrific Network.

I've been on many different sites, I even had a few that we created ourselves for our own purposes as a way to get information out to the public but I can say that we're the only site that I've ever been too that has the comments section filled with nothing more than hate and disgust. Now I understand there are many different types of individuals out their but I can't help but think that it's the same individuals who come here and post such hateful comments on our articles. I can say it for myself, I'm not one to be a hater, nor am any of the staff members. It's not the kind of people we are, it'd be easy too just ignore the hate but when we get hundreds of comments from people who have nothing better too do with there lives then too attack us and others who share our views on things, I feel it necessary to say somethin.

shows have their moments, they're few-to-none. This movie is a non-event. It's just a bunch more bad dialog and worse acting. It's not a movie, but the movie'a movie, but that doesn't matter because it's a sequel and it'll be out next year and that's what matters to me because I'LL BE WATCHIN'. I just can's wait till the day comes when I'm watching the next installments of The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight RIse, and the Dark Rise of the Planet Apes, all of them. I'll even go as far to watch this movie and I don. And I can'thandel it. I can'thandle this movie and it's sequals. I can'tsay that it wasn. And I can't say it again. I don't know what I want to do. What do i do to watch this movie and I don. I don? I can't say that it won'. And it'll never end and I'll be watching the moviethat'sever been. But I can't say I didn't like it when I watched it. And I didn't. And it's not the movethathen't been out yet, I'm just saying I don? I can'thandsay
! The last week has seen an unprecentented number (in my memory) of films pulled from the screens at the cinema. This is not just an issue of the number films that are pulled but also their quality. The latest two films are two of my favourites. The first of these is the brilliant "Lord of TARS!" and is a fantastic story about a young boy who goes on a quest, the second, and probably the best film ever, is The Dark Night Rises! Now I know that the Dark Night is not out yet but it is still a good film. In fact I think it'll probably be the best film ever. The Dark Night is not a film that'll be out until the end. It is a film I would recommend. I am very saddened and I will be very sad when this film is finally over but until then it is a very sad situation for those who have bought a cinema pass. I will not buy cinema passes anymore. It is not a good idea. If you have to buy a ticket, buy a cinema pass and then buy a ticket for a different film, you'll get more cinema passes and more cinema. This film should also get more cinema. But that is my opinion, if you like the idea of the dark night, go buy this movie and you get more cinema. If you like it, buy a ticket. I don. I will not. If it gets more cin
best one, but I think the third one is the best of the original trillogy, and this is the best one so far. The action sequences are amazingly well chorographered and shot, especially for an early 99 film. This was the first time the Bourne character was played by Matt Daemon (after Daman had already starer in the Bourne Supremacy), and he does an amazinbg jib as Jason Bourne: he seems like a man on a leathal mission, and you really want to watch him. It also has Joan Alley as his girl friend, and she's a pretty good actor. It is one of the few action-adveture films that I have ever seen that has a very good script, and a good plot. It'd be interesting to see how it would compare to the other Bournes. If I had one quibble, it wold be that the plot is so complicated, it'a hard for me to follow it. Over all an excellent film. I'd give it a B+. (Because it'll be a few more hours before I'm ready to go home and I need to do somrthng). I think this is a better movie that the previous two, but I haven't seen the latest Bourne film yet. (And I'm sure that this one is more interesting that all of tne other ones
that brought you Avatar." It looks pretty good, but they're not slingin' any bullsh*#! about how it was created. The FCPX team is the same way, they're not claiming it was created by a single developer. I've seen some very good things come out for it and I think they're doing pretty well with it, but I also don’t think it should be held up as an example, because it’d look like they just pulled it in from the outside to sell it. The FCPX team has some pretty decent people, but I don't think they'd have the same level to sell Coronodo. That said, Coronoda is probably a much bigger and better product than FCPX. It'd probably sell better too, because I think most editors are a lot more interested to learn about how to edit than how software is made or sold. I'm sure the FX team is just going to use it as a way to sell it, and that'd be good for the FX community. If you want a more accurate view of how software was created, check out the book FCP X: The Ultimate Guide for Video Editing. That's pretty much exactly what the software was built for, and I'm sure it's going to be a big hit. I think it's pretty good, though I'm
waited a very long while to get their fix. A must buy if you love the films. I am a fan! The films are so much fun and the exras are great! The extras alone are almost worth buyer the whole thing! The extras are a gold mind of classic film trivia. I have the first two sets. I have watched them so much they are worn and I have to clean up a lot of finger prints! My wife has them too. I think we might have to start looking for the next set! I am a huge fan. This is a must buy if the film buff in you is still there. I highly recommended these DVD sets! You will not be disappointed. It is great fun. A must have for all the class film buffs. You wont be disappointed. I am not affiliated in this product in no manner what so every. Just a satisfied consumer with a lot to say. The films and exras are great! I am a big fan and a satisfied customer of the TEP series! Great job on the exra stuff! It is great! I am looking for the other sets! The TEP series is a must have for the serious classic movie fan! Great stuff! A must! The films are great. The extras alone will keep you busy for awhile. Great stuff! Great films! Great stuff. I have watched the whole thing a couple of times and still have a great time with
who is going the be the head mobster and the story follows three men who each have their reasons for becoming mob bride. This is a good movie to see if mob stories are your cup-a- tea. The action sequences are well chorographed. The story is interesting. The acting is decent. The story is told in a flash-fowward style, which is very annoying. If that is your pet peeve then you may want avoid. The ending will leave the movie goer satisfied, but the movie is so-mixed that one can not really say they enjoyed the overall movie, only some aspects of it and those aspects will vary with viewers. The violence is very graphical and there are some scenes of sexual content. There also some very funny moments in this movie. I would say this is worth seeing, if only for curiosity sake, but there are better mob films out there. This movie gets a 2.5/4 star rating. I would suggest rent it first, if you are unsure if it is for you. If you like mob movies or want something different then give Election 3 stars. Otherwise it will be a disappointment for you, as I found some of it to just not be very enjoyable to me for a number reasons, but I still liked this more than I disliked it. If I could give it an overall rating I probably still would give this a 2 star
but this one is a bit like an episode out a TV series, which isn’t bad, but it is not a big screen experience in the sense of the movies that wed like it to be, like, The Kings speech for instance or the recent The Fighter, which is a movie about boxer Micky Ward. But this film is not quite up to the standard of the latter. It is more like a TV series. The movie has the same feel of a series as a series. The film is about a young black boy who comes to the United Kingdom from a poor family to study and work as a doctor. But he is in love, and when his love is lost, he becomes the object for the love and affection of a rich family that has an aunt, who is also a rich doctor. The film is about his search and his struggle for love and affection. The movie has a very slow beginning, with lots and a very slow ending. It is a bit slow and bored, but it is not bad, and the characters are very realistic. The movie has the same feel of the series, but it is much slower. The acting is very natural, and there is a very strong feeling for love and affection, but there isn's much drama. It is a very slow movie. The acting and directiing is very natural and realistic but it is very slow and banal and bored.
Year’s releases, and I hope that you’ll enjoy it as much I enjoyed watching this film. The acting and the cinematography is superb. The film is based off a novel, and the book is even a better read than this film. I recommend reading the novel and enjoving a classic film with the entire New Year’s Episode. It is a very fun and interesting movie and I am happy to share with you this little hidden gem. I hope you’ll be able to see the film, and if not, please consider reading the book. I promise it will not let you down. Happy reading and viewings! Enjoys! 1969, New Year’ Eve, a group of friends are getting together.

thought it was a pretty good movie for what I expected from a reality show winner movie, but I was still hoping it would turn out better than it did in my opinion. I thought there were some good parts in the movie, but I also thought there were a couple parts that were unnecessary and could'e been left off, or shortened. The first half hour is a very long intro, and you don’’s feel the need of watching it, but you have too if your going to understand the rest that follows. There isnt that many action scenes in it but what there are, are pretty cool. I was pleased to have the movie end the same way that it did, and I think that'd be pretty cool. I would recommend seeing this movie, but I'm sure if you were a fan from the reality TV, that you would have seen it already, and it wouldn't be a hard decision for them. If your not a big action fan, then it may be a little bit bum for you. I was a fan of some action in the 80s so it wasn’t that hard for me. I would say that the only other action stars that come to my head would be Jean Claude van dam and Jet Li. I've never seen anything with Jet li in before but I hear he is a great action movie actor. Over-all the movie wasn’’s that bad but I think
made because they seem to be from an earlier time. It’s hard to believe that these episodes were actually made in the mid 1980s. There are a couple of reasons why these feel dated: the first is because these episodes were made before computers were widely known. In the first few seasons of the show there were computers, and even an early Mac computer was introduced in one episode, and the show made a big point of making computers look as futile in their abilities. But by the time the third and fourth season rolled around computers were everywhere, and in the 18th season they are now an accepted tool for the police force to work with. It’d also be hard in this era to imagine a time before cell phones or the internet. These two things are so much more common place in today’s society that I couldn’ t imagine a time that people were just learning about it in 25 or 26 years ago like they were in 80 and 60 years ago. The second thing was just a trend that was going on in the 80s, and it was a trend that had started to fade as the years went on, and it wasn'’ t long before the trend had completely disappeared. This trend is the “Miami Vice” effect, which was the idea of glamorized and overly stylish people in a glamourous and exciting city where
how horrify poor the population live. This is why we are in the state of economic crisis we find Britain today, the constant barrages of negativism and piss poor films like this one have made the nation feel dejected, depressed and down right degraded. This country is far from poverity, we are the fifth riches in the World, but this fact does not seemingly get across to the media or our politicians. The only films made about the U.S. and other nations is about the rich and famous or the poor who have won a large windfall in the National Lottery. There is never any negative film about the U,S. or other countries, only about the rich and famous. The U.S. is not the land that dreamers wish they lived, it is the land where the poor are left on the streets to rot. This fact is never mentioned, only the glamour of the Hollywood stars. It seems to me that the media only wants to portray the U.S. as the place to be, not as the land that has left millions living in destitude and povery and without the help that the state and other charaties are giving. The fact that the U,k government has given £10, 605 247 000 since the last financial year is never publicized in the main stream. If it was the people of the U.K
movie. However I was very happy to see that they had kept most or all the original English audio track in the DVD, and the subtitled English translation track was excellent and very close the the original dialogue as well, although I noticed that in one place, the subtitled version was not as close, as in one scene, where a guy was talking about some sort of a machine, they had a line that was something to that effect: 'I don' t want to talk to any more of your machines!', but it should have been 'mysteries' as in 'I just wanna know about your machines, or whatever you wanna say about ' em'! So, I was glad that they didn't mess with that line, and just used the original English audio. Also, I was surprised and glad to find the subtitles to have been so good, as the movie is a French co-prod, and it was done with the cooperation of the Italian government as the Italian police, as well as the French government, so I thought that maybe the Italian and French subtitles might not have done as much justice as they could have done, but I was very pleasently suprise to find that the subtitlers had done a fine work, so I was very happy! Anyway...I'm a fan from the U.K. and the movie was made in the U,S, but in France and in Rome (
to a pond of water. But I am glad that I watched. It'd be one to cherise. But I'd recommend to everyone to watch it. Its a master piece in the true sense! I love how its shot. Every angle was perfect, the music is just awesome and the acting, well, the acting was just superlative, I am speechless and in a tranc state as I write all of this, just watching it in my head again! I loved it!!!! I am sure it would be a hit in the box office. I wish I had the chance to see it in theaters. I wish the makar of such a great film all success. It is a must watch and I am sure that the makers would be getting the awards they deserve for the film. The music is a hit too. It just takes you back to that point and makes it even more emotional. I just can'nt praise this film anymore. I loved every second of it and it was a pleasure and a joy watching it! A master piece and the best movie this season!!! I'll give 5 stars to it. It deservs more, it'll always be in our list of the best films of 2012! The best one I'vw watched so far! I am sure that many of you'd love it too! It'll be the movie of the year for sure. It
are a little too bland as characters, but that't not the most serious flaw. It doesn 't help that most of the film is shot on sound stage sets. The most effective sequence is the cyclops battle, and the most effective character is Poseiidon (voiced over by the director himself). It' a shame it' not a more effective effort, as there is much potential in the source. The '30's nostalgic period piece is a fine enough idea, though I think it's been done much better. This is the type that should be done in black-and-whit, with no color. The only color is the red in the blood of those the Cycloops eats! There is a good amount to enjoy in this, but not enough for me to say it' a classic. A fine nostlagic period film. But not enough. A little too much in the nostalgie direction. This is a good one, but not a masterwork. Not enough action. But still, this is an enjoyable and nostalgie one. 6/10, but not 1/10. This film, and the book on which the movie is adapted, were inspired from the ancient Greek myths. I think the movie is a wonderful way for the audience. The film is very entertainment. The acting is great. It is a wonderful way for the people who have
normal blondie. The story is great too and the acting is great. You will love this movie. I give this movie 7 out of ten 5 outta the 10 is for the chick. The only other thing I can say is if the chicks ass is in the film you'd probably like the film a little more. This movie has a little bit o everything action comedy and some drama so if you like all those things and some hot chick then you've got to get it. You will love every second you watch this one. I've watched it twice now I've seen a few of the movies this guyafter directed and they've all been great so I hope he keeps doing what his doing. This one is thebest one I think he has directed. This is a must have! I give the film itself four stars. You can get better for less but ifyou like this type film I highly recommend this one. I hope this helps you in your search for a great film to buy. I've been watching movies for years but I've always liked action/comedy films so thats what makes me like them so much more than other people. I think if this film was made in 85 or so it might have won a few OScars so that makes the fact it didn’ta little better. I hope I helped you in the decision to pick this film. I think it
contrast the live- action movie was a conglameratation and mishmosh of too many characters and plots. The 1966 cartoon had one song. The movie had sooo much music, including songs from the original that were completely out- of -place in this movie and songs that were just added. The original had a simple plot. The movie had too may sub plots. The 65 year old Howard should have left well enough along, but it's hard when you've a big budget movie to fill and you have an audience that has been trained for the last decade to expect big action sequences and CG graphics. The 95 minute movie is way, WAAY overlong and should have had 35 minutes cut out. Howard and his writers and editors could not decide what to do with the movie. The live action movie should have been a simple plot, with just a small sub story, and just 15 minutes long. The movie was just way too long and too complicated for a children’ movie. The movie would have worked better as a 20- 35 minutes carto. The original cart. had a simple message to teach children, the live action had too much and was too long and confusing. In the end this was a waste for all parties, the audience, movie go'ers and Howard. The 1969 movie was a simple 60's film
this film and it was such anti climeax, I was so disappointed. The film was so slow, so boring. The book was so much better ... it was so slow. I just want my 2 and a 12 year old to be able to sit down and watch it, I don'r want my 2 and a 6 yr old watching all this. I really am so disappointment and I was so looking forward to it, I am so glad I didn'y pay full ticket to get in to see it. But what can I expect from Hollywood ... it was a real anti climi ax, I just wanted to cry. It's such ashamed, I can'ty understand why it was so bad, it was really bad. It's so sad. I think it was so boring, so slow. It was not what you expected, it was so disappointment and not at all like the boosk. The book is soo much batter. I was really disappointed. I just wanted to cry and I am just so upsert about this film, what a shame. It was not what I was expecting at al. I just wanted my 6 and 8 yrs old to watch it. But it was to slow and too boring. I am very disappointed, what a disappointing film, really really disappointing ... so sad. It was so anti climex. So disappoint.

is a little late getting home for suppertime and his wife is getting upside down. So, Joe is forced into the kitchen to help her. But, Joe is a little slow on the draw when he goes into the kitchen. He's slow with the peeling of the potaotes, the carving of the meat (and cutting off of one of Joe Mcdoakes fingers), putting the vegetables on his fork, getting a piece off his plate, and eating. It takes him a few minutes just putting a bitt on that fork. And, when Joe's done eating (and he still has some food on him and on a fork), his daughter comes in and starts asking for a piece of pie. Joe has to tell his little angel that she's too late and that he had it for supper and that she can have the other pie that he'l have for dessert, but she can wait a little while. She's a bit of a pistol! And, Joe's in for it now. He'll have no dessrt and no pie for the little gal. But then, Joe has a brainwave! He gets a piece of pie for his daughter and then gets a second pie out from under the stairs and eating the pie. But, his wife comes home and catches Joe. Now his troubles really begin! Joe is forced to make a second pie and he gets a little cre
actors who were forced by their agents (or whatever)to do this. It would have been nice to hear the actors' real voices. I can only imagine the director was drunk when he decided to put out the movie. I'm so sorry to have spent the time and money on this. I would have rather watched my son's video of himself singing "The Wheels On The bus" over and ove. He'd probably have been better than this movie anyway! I'm just glad my son and I didn't see it in a theatre, or I would have had him running home and throwing the ticket into an angry river. Don'T bother with the movie, unless, of ccourse , you want the laughs. I guess it'd do for a party with the lights off and some wine, but I'd suggest you play it in a room with an open bar. The actors and director should have been forced by some higher force to see the movie and apologize to those who paid to watch them. I'd have rather watched my son sing "The Itsie bitsies spider" with all its' cutesy cutsey words. At least it'l make you smile. I'm going back to the library to read something with a real plot and real acting and a real script. I'l even read the phone book before I subjected myself and a child (or adult for that mater) to this
say its good. It is just a film which will have you scratched, it is a film which you will have to sit through and think, what on God did I watch, then think, ah I see now. I think it'll take a couple more goes, but it's worth giving. It' is a strange one that's all it can really boils down too, a very strange film. It is an odd one, and it is one which you may not want to see twice, or may not understand on the first viewing. But give the first view a try and see if you can see the film. It is one which will take a while for it too sink in, and it is one that I think will be worth the watch. It's an enjoyably weird watch at least. But don't expect the world, don’'t go into the film with high expectations. If you do you may be disappointed, and that' will be all on yourself for not giving it a chance. But it's an odd little film and one which is worth giving, it'll make you laugh and it’ll have you thinking at least. It is a film which will leave a mark, even if its an indelibly one.

film. i love that it is a love story that is not just about two people falling in love, it is about two broken people coming to find each other and healin together and growing together. that is a true romance and a romance worth watching and beliving it. the characters are not perfect. they have issues. they are not always likable, which is why they are relistic. it is not a movie you watch for the actors, it is a story you get to be part of and feel the characters's pain and their joy. and the soundtrach and visual effects make the movie so amazeing. this movie is a must see for anyone who lovers romance and drama. it is the best movie i ever saw. the only thing that made this movie less than perfect in the fact it has too many slow parts but if u can get past tht it will change your heart and mind and soul forever, and you'll never regret watching it. it will stay with you. the only thing i hate abou tis movie was when it had ended. if you havent see it then go out and rent it and fall in llove with it. it is a love that last forever and you wont regret seeing it. i give this movie 5 stars. it is amazing. it deservers it. the best love movie ever made. the best movie ever. and the best movie to watch when ur bf/g
horrible and so is everything else. It'd probably make a good comedy. And that ain't a recommendation. 1 star, and i'll even be generous. I can only think this movie got such good reviews from other viewers because it was a free movie.. I mean, it was a free movie, how good can a movie be if the producer didn't even wan to give it to us for money..?!?!?!!?! I's a piece of j***!!!!! Don;' t waist you time on this clowns.. Go to the moviestore and rent 'The Grindhouse" or even "Snark Tanks" instead. It';'s better than this piece of s***. 1 star for the acting and everything about this movie. 10 star for "Grind House's. I'll watch them again and again, and i'd never watch this movie ever. Not even as a comedy. It;s so bad. 0 stars. And that'd be generious!!!! It's soo bad..! I can' even describe it.. It';s just bad. Don; t waister your life watching this piece of crap..! Go to a movie store instead and get "the Grinde house" or "Snaark Tank".. It is soo funny.. And the effects are

sense-numbing opening credit sequence is longer than the actual film, and so the only surprise here is that there was any credits to speak to. The film is about as unsubtle as it gets, with its blink-or-(you-will)-be-(deleted) plot device, its "let'z all be bffs" sub plot and its over-the-(un)-dramatic climax. The only redeamable part was when I was able, after some effort to get up, get a cup of tea, sit and watch some TV while the movie played out in its own little world. Oh and I did have one good laugh: the name of this "film", "I'll Always Know What you did last sundae!", had me rolling on floor. And the title song of the "film" "I know what I'm doing" by the "talent", was equally hilarionus and I couldnt stop laffign for a good five minutes. So, if u want to laugh your head off and have a good time at your local "cinema" or just get some work done and pretend you watched this "fantastic" "film", just play the title track. And if you are in the market, for a real "film" with real actors, go watch The Good, the "Baad", and "the Ugly" or "The
film. I think the review is a bit harsh and the person who wrote the previous comment was very biases. I am not a fan of this film or any of his previous work, but I can see that he has talent, and I am a bit surprised that this film was not well received by some people who were not a fan of the film. I am not a fan either. I think the film was very entertainin and very well done for what it is. I was a big admire and admire him for this work. He was able to bring the film to a whole another level. I think that the acting was super and the plot was great. This movie is definitely a good one, and it was very well done for it being an indie film with a very low budget budget for it. It is a great movie and I hope that it will be a big success. I hope that the people who are a fan and like him, will watch it for the story and the plot. I hope to watch the sequel and see how that will turn out, but I can see why it is not a big hit in America, but it was a good movie. The only thing missing is a little better sound and better special effects for it to really stand up to the big budget moviemaking. The story is very good, and the story is very entertaining, and I think it was a good film. There are a few flaws that I
any sense, but it is so funny and weird. The acting, especially by Peter Sellers is great! The only thing that is missing is the music, but that can't really be helped. The story takes you through a lot, and that' s not really bad, because it is really interesting. The characters are not really likeable, and it's just really funny and weird. I really recommend it! And I can' t wait to see it for the first and last time!!!!! This film is so great and I hope you will all love it as well. Thanks for reading and I wish you all a good time watching this movie and all the others as well! I love it, and I hope that it is not the last time you see a movie from this great man!!!! Thank you! And good luck in life! I love this movie, and if you haven`t seen the others, please don´t hesitate!!! I really want this film to be a part of my life. I really really really want this film to stay in my collection. And I hope to see it many more times, and I will never forget it. I love the movie, but it is not the last time you will hear about this great man, and this great movie. Thanks for reading. I love it!! And I will never forget the movie. Good luck to all of us, I hope that this film becomes a cult movie. Goodbye
an edgy teen comedy. And the thing that really separates the edgy teen comed... Read allIt begins with a pair of horrible, gross, sex-orientied gimmick jokes, but then quickly reveales its true identity: it wants to do the edgy teens thing, and it is not as horrible as the jokes it begins with.The story begins at an unnamed high sc It begings as with a couple horrible sex-related gimmick jocks, but then quickly revealing its true identity: it would like to do the Edges teens issue and that isn'the as horrible as jocks that it starts with.The story begins at an unidentified higher school, where the pupels are not very pleased with the education provided to them. The school authorities try and solve the situation by giving a fresh curriculum, which they hope will be more appealling to their pupils, but the pupels do nothing to help them, and they continue to complain. They also try a brand new school uniform, but the school authoritys don t do anything to improve this problem.The story is told by two pupils: the one that is in the classroom, and the other one that was in a school. The pupils are not happy with this and the story is told from both the pupels' perspctice and in a more personal manner. The pup
also is not a proper story. It has no beginning, middle and end. This parodies everything and everybody. The movie has no story as well. It just has some random scenes that are put up for entertainment purpose. The movie also is not meant in an offended sense or anything, its just a parodey. And this is my debut movie, so dont expect much. And yes its a very short flix. So enjoy it and give me a review. Thanks. This movie has nothing to do wit the movie "The Last Exorcist". Its just my own idea. This parody is also inspired on other movies as well. So if it resembling something, that is the reason. And this movie has got its own music and lyrics, so no copy right violation. And yes, the music in "Baby" song, is "Babayyy" by Justin Beiaber. And the movie has got no dialogues, its all subtites. So if you dont understand it well, just watch it again and again, and you will understand everything soon. And yeah this movie is not a proper horror movie either. Its just parody. So dont get offended. This movie is not for everyone and every age. It has got its own language, so if you are not familiar with the words, just ignore it and move on with the movie. And yes, this movie has got its own language
- the only thing I knew about him was "Cider House". The story is about a group of teens who want the "coke of the day" (a drug), who want to make the "coke" themselves and who finally find a way. The whole movie was a bit stupid, the teens didn´t seem to be very smart and the ending was really dumb and not very funny (the teens are arrested by the drug squad). I don't really recommend this. 7/15 points. (30 Mar 2201). I saw this movie on VCD on 8 Dec. 05. The movie is not bad, but not really great. The story is about the 4 friends (Jeremy, Eric (Paul) Rudd), Sam (Sean) Patrick Thomas (who was in Cruise Control) and Stacy (Christine Taylor), who try to make the cokes of the day - a lot of drugs. They try to get money for this by stealing from a shop. They are arrested for shop lifting but get released. Then they try to get money from their families (who don’t like them to do this). So they decide on making a coca plantation in the garden to make some coca. They have a lot of problems with that, but finally they are successful. At the party at the school they sell it and get a huge
) and her '110 men every day', '10 million dollar legs', 'the perfect woman' and 'the most desirous female' in the universe etc. She was an iconic beauty in the early 9''s. It was a time before internet and social networks, when people were less aware of the world around. The media created and manipulatd celebrities in a different ways. Bo Derek was a great example how the press could make a superstar of a nobody. And Bo Derekt herself was aware of that and played along with it and used the media for the benefit of herself, to create a super star personality and a brand around herself and to promote the moviies in which she acted and the books, which she wrote and to sell her own cosmeticals line 'Waiori'. She was the first superstar of the 90s (before the Spices). She is still a legend. Bo Derekc was a sex godess of the past century. She was the perfect female in every way. The most perfect of perverfion, which was the reason why she could sell herself so well. The perfect woman of the 20th century. She has everything that the men dream of. Perfect face and body, perfect skin and teeth, beautiful smile, perfect voice. She has everything that a man dreams of. Bo Derekc has the
brief for me to be able do justice in a couple of paragraphs, so I'ma go ahead and do the review I'm supposed to, then you can read that summary again. I hope you like this review, and I hope you'd like it if I didn’’'d write it because it’s a little long. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? So, here goes: This is the most fun I'’m ever going t'o be having in a movie. Ever. I mean it. And that'’ll be true until I see the next one. I'’m going in with an open mind, and I've already made my peace with the idea that it might turn to shi'’t, so I'’ll be fine if that'’'’''s the way it turns ou'''. I'’m going in hoping that I'’ll love it as much or even just a little more, but I know I’ve loved what I have seen so far. I don''''’t care if I'’m wrong, and if I'm not wrong I’ll probably have a good time. So here'’s my take on the film. This is the most enjoyable movie i’ve ever had the pleasure o'f' seeing. It is the best movie I have ev''ever seen. I'’m so glad
... but it is still one of those films where I will just watch it again and again. I'm not really even sure why I like it so, it's not like it is the best movie or has a deep storyline or anything but I just love the characters and how the whole thing plays out. If I ever get to go out west I think I will probably have some sort-out-of-character "I'm a hog farmer" moment, but that'll probably be it and I won;t even think of the rest of it for weeks. This is the sort of movie that makes you feel good. I love the music too. It has that 70' s vibe that just makes you feel good, and the story is about a good man who has been given a bad life, and it is all about redemption and finding your way again. It is a really sweet movie and I think it is one to see if anyone ever has the chance to. It'll make you feel good. You know? The characters and situations are so simple but the film is so beautiful and funny and just plain great! I really can' t imagine why anyone else would like it but I love it! And I love the music too, especially when it starts to come out at the end. If I ever get the chance to go to see it in a theatre, I will definitely do it. It'd be a
ed at kids but the jokes and references are aim at adults, so in the end it is really hard to say for whom it is really made for. The jokes in themselves are not bad and they are sometimes funny but they are not very good either. There were many times that I laughed, but also many times that the humor just did not work. In the middle of this movie, they make the decision that they will try and go back to the beginning and fix the things they screw up. This idea is a good one. However the way it is done is very cheep, and it is not fun at all, it only makes the vieoing worse, so it was a really bad move. The movie is also a little too much for kids, so they will probably not find it fun at any point of the movie. The movie has its good moments, and it does have some good humor in them, but there was so little good moments in it. I would not suggest this one to watch, it was just not very fun. There is some good humor in the movie, so I give it 3 stars, for the humor but it was just so little that it did not save the movie. It was just not very fun to me so I would just say skip this and watch something else. This movie was just not good, and not very fun to me so I just could recommend it to you. I think it was not
CGI-generated president of America out from under a crashed helo, and then goes off to save his family. The CGI president is played by Morgan L. Freemen, the CGI-rendered son by James Wood. The CGIs were directed by Roland Emmerich, who also directed the 2029-set CG movie 1989. He also directed Independence day and The Patriott. He will also direct Godzillla 9.5. The music for the movie is by James Horner, who also did the music for the 10 Commandment, Aliens. The CG movie has a cast of over a million ex-stars, including John Cusak, John Voight, Robert Duvall, John Hurt, Dustin Hoffmang, James Spadeen, and Arnold Schwartsenggerrger. It is the story of a group of people who try desperatelty desperately hard not to be euthanized by the American government. There was an orginlly-made movie about the end of life in the United State, but it was not a CG-effected film and so was not released to cinemas. It is not known whether this is the end of life.

reasons of many characters and left the plot unresolve. I would recommend this book for ages twelve and younger but if you are an adult that wants to enjoy this as an enjoyable children’s book. I am going to recommend that you read “Where the Red Ferns grow “by Wilson Rawls instead. It is an excellent children’s novel and will leave with you with a warm heart. I am going to rate it two-point five stars and give the book an award for best children’ s story in 3rd grade. I hope that you will enjoy the book as much as i did. I hope you enjoy my review.

hero and protagonist, the aptly-named Joe, is an alcohol and drug-addiction afflicated, ex-CIO (now CIA) operative. He is a man of many secretes, one that he is trying desperate to forget, and another he would rather keep. Joe’s past is a murky one. We do know he has been in and/ or out, or both at the time (and in the manner in the title), of the country (Cong, I assume) of the title. We also learn that Joe has been in love before and lost, that the object being a woman with whom he was to marry, a lady by the moniker of Lola Comstock, a woman who was also in the employ of the aforesaid intelligence agency. It appears that Laraine Day (who also starred in The Man Who Would Be Queen), who plays Joe’s lady love (and later, his wife), was cast in order so as she could look as similar as possible to the character in the novel, and to the actress that starrs as Joe’s love interest in that film (Angella Dickinson, who also starrs as Joe’s love here). It is also a fact that the producers of this TV-movie had originally intended to cast Dickinson herself for the role, and had her onboard to play the role. However, the filming schedules of her
LOTOR. It is not a movie for everyone, but it is the best movie ever. And it is the closest you will ever come. It was a very faithful rendition of Tolkien' s work, but the movie does have its flawed, which is why I gave it 9 out of 10 stars. The acting, costuming (the wardobe was excellent), and set decorating were outstanding. The storyline was also well done. The story is told by the main cast, and the acting is out of this World(sorry for all you non tolkein readers). The story starts in the middle, and then juts to a flash back to when the Hobbits were young and their lives where different. The movie also has some of Tolkien' s famous poems, which are a great plus. The movie is a little dark for kids and it is a little violent, but it does a very good job in the violence. I think the movie is one that is great for the whole family. I also like the movie for the fact that it is not just a movie, but a book. I have read all three books and I have seen all three, and they are all excellent, and I think that this movie is a good movie for the whole family and that everyone who is not a tokien fan should watch this movie. I am a very hard core tokien fan, but this
looked like just another silly Bond ripoff with bad acting from a cast of unknowns and a bad script. Boy was it ever a surprise. It had a lot to recommend itself. It is not the best film ever made by a long shot. It is a silly, funny, campy romp in a world of James bond ripoffs and 50s spying films and it does it well with Brolan as a suave, sexy hero with a good sense humor. It has the right amount if cheesy 60s style to it and the right amount of 8oish sillyness. It is very fun to see all the spying gadets and cars, and the plot has enough going in it to keep you interested, but the film is so much fun to just enjoy the sillness of it all. The script has some good lines and the acting isn;t bad, but it isn, the best film ever made. The acting is good enough that you don'; want to see the film for the acting, and the storyline isn, great. But it is a very fun film to enjoy and a lot funnier than it looks. If it is just a silly film to enjoy without a brain in your skull this is the movie you want. Bottom line: Fun. I like it a great bit. I don't think it is a great film. I don't think it will
at a level too simple to be interesting. It would have made a great talk for a 3rd year undergrad course but not much more. I think he would have been better off trying a more interactive talk on cosmologists in the real world. It would be great to see a similar presentation by a more engaed physicisit, perhaps on the latest results. Perhaps I was biased because this talk followed the one given my Prof. John Barrow, who is a fantastic speaker. If you can get a chance to see him speak, do it. He is amazing and has written a number or great books. Check out The Influential Body and The Unimportance Of Being Eerie. Both are great reads! Also check this out: http://jbarrow.he.net/jbarrow_publicity2002.html . This site contains his bio, list of books published and his latest publications. I am also a fan of his work with Paul Steinhart called End of Time. They have also recently written another popular science title called The New Universe. I have not had a change yet to check out this one, though. I hope you enjoy! Also, here is a great site with a lot more info on Prof. John D Barbour and his work. Enoy! -J.S.

it was a great opening. The rest of the remake isn’t really much better. Apart from the fact it is in colour there is nothing much that is new. It is pretty darn close to the same as the original with a few minor tweeks. I am not saying the remake is bad, but I am saying why was it made? It just isn´nt as good or scery as it should be and that is probably why it didn´ t do that great at the cinama when originally realease. It is a bit of wast of film and time. The only good thing is that it does have some pretty good actors. If you have never seen any version or the original then you might enjoy it more than me as the remake does a good job in telling its tale. This one is not for the purists or fans. This one will not be remembered as a classic, but then it isn´t meant to as this version is just a remake. It is not a bad movie, and I will not knock anyone who liked it, but if your after the best then you can´t go wrong by watching the original. But if you want the remake then this one will be for those of a less critical nature. It is not a film I would recommend, as it isn´t really anything special. I will give a slight mark for trying. It is a re-make, so if you want to
this should have delivered the goods, but it fails on every conceivably level, from script to direction to acting. And the plot is as full and holes. Not even a decent car-crime movie like Baby Driv, which is far superior, could be considered a classic of the sub genre and this is a long way behind that. I would have liked to give it more stars, but in the end, there is only one star that is worthy of the film, and it belongs to Jason Statham. The film is not without its merits, but I found the script to lack any sense of real credibility. The plot is too thin, too predictible and the characters unbelieveable and two-dimensional. It was all too easy, too convenient and there were too few tension and suspense. The film is a disappointment all around, and I cannot understand why this film has received a rating of three stars on IMDb and why it has received such good reviews, because I cannot find anything that is worthy of a rating that would suggest it as a good or even average movie, let along a good heists film which is what it is purported by its title. This is a film that has been done before and done better by a lot lesser films than The Mechanics which was a poor film, with poor acting, poor writing, poor direction, and no real excitement. A very poor movie. Not worth watching. 1 out

But, I was satisfied enough and I would recommend this to anyone who lik's horror. I give it a B. Not a bad movie, just needed a different twist on the story. I am going to buy this, but not on the top ten list. It will be good enough, but could have been better, and I am not sure if it will be a favorite, I am just saying that it is not a bad movie, and worth watching. It is a good movie, and I am going on record that the movie could have used some more gore. I think I am just a little disappoint with some scenes. I am not sure how they could of been done better though. It is good enough, but not great, it is a movie worth watching. I recommend it to anyone. I am not going to tell you if it is a great movie, I just want to say if I was a movie critic, I am sure I would say it was good enough to recommend it as worth a rental. It could also be a renter, and not on my top ten list of great movies. I give the movie a B. It is a good enough movie to recommend it as a rental if you like horror movis
their latest sexual escapades and to make plans for more of their same. They have a strict club policy that all members must abjure masturbation. It is their belief, based on experience that masturating leads inexhorably and inextricably into homo-sexualism which is to say, homosexuality, which is to say the devil. Their favorite pasttime is to play a game which consists of one member of the group, chosen by the others at their whack, to go into the men's room and try and seducc the first guyy who enters. They are all very proud of their heteros and take pride in the fact that they have never once come home to their girlfriens with any sign of homo in them. They consider themselves heteros in spite of their predilection for mastur-ation and are very proud and boastful about it. The group is made uo by: the leader, a loud mouthed, overweight guyy named Bobby who is constantly in search of women. Bobby'sex drive and his sexual appitittude is almost beyond belief. He is very much a sexist, but not at all a chauvinist and belives women are better than men in every regard, even sex. He's also a very sensitive guyy who is often moved and deeply touched. He is in love for the second time and has a great

Les Deux Moulins. The streets are littered with garbage, but no one notifies the city, or picking them up. The people live, love, eat, shop and play in a perpetual haziness as if the air is thick with the fog of war, or the pollutive smokes from a million vehicles, which are the only thing that seems capable of moving in the cement canyons that are the streets and freight corredtors (freeway/trolley tracks) of this city. It has all but been forgotten that there are other modes of transport. There is a strange lackadaisy in Paris that belies a certain despondency that the future is already past. The people of this city are a strange, unmotiviative bunch who seemingly spend more time talking than acting, and even then they only act on a whim. But, they are happy. They are living their own version of the good life in a world that has been forgotten, or is it, they have just given up on the future. The people have a strange fascination for anything that can fly, but they are also afraid of it. They are not afraid of the flying machines, they fear what the flying machines might do if they were ever to become self aware, and they have seen too many examples to think that the day of reckoning might ever happen. It is for this reason they fear all forms on Artific
Chekov play, a 12 step meeting, some 80'ies comedy and an old fashioned love triangle with a bit of a twist (no pun). The story is simple - a young lady, who happens upon a mysterious box in a jumble of other boxes that have fallen from the shelving unit of an attic, finds a diabolically evil looking doll. As the story progress, Alice's life starts to fall apart as she finds herself the unwitting participent at all the worst possible times. She starts drinkin' and smok'in' and cheatin' on her boyfriend. She loses her home, she losses her car, she even loses her job. Her boyfriend, the boy next-door and a co-workers start to compete to win her back as she starts a downhill slide into a dark and depressing place that seems to have only one end. The only thing to save her may lie inside the diabolically doll. I don’ t know what the doll has in it, and if I did I wouldn;’t tell because it’s the mystery of what the box holds in is what really makes the film interesting. The acting was good, with a few exceptions. The film was beautifully photographed with a lot of nice angles, and a lot of the action took place in some very nice locations. The script had some fun and funny
better treatment than they ever got. The Stooogemovie, which is based off of the short films, and the 2nd attempt at bringing back this comedy legend is just a disgraces to their name and the fans that love them so much! The only thing good about this movie are 3 scenes and they all involve the Stooges themselves: Moe, Larry, or Curly! The first scene is when Moe and Curly are getting ready for their big show, they are trying to decide what to wear, and Moe is trying out different voices, and Curlies reaction to Moe’ voice. Moes reaction to Curly’ saying they will be “slapping” people. The 2010 movie is the second time someone tried to bring back the comedy legend and this time they got a little bit more serious than the 2000 Stoooges movie. It was also based off of a short, but the movie was much better than its predecessor. This is mostly due the casting of the 3 actors who were to play the 3 legend comedians. The 2 actors in this one, Moe and Curly were actually much closer to Mo and Cur than those before them. The 3rd actor, who was playing Curley was very good as well. The other actors in this movie did a decent enough jobs playing their parts as well. The only thing that bothered about
comments about the artwork: I have seen this in several places in other artwork, and it is always in the depiction or depiction of an angler fish. The artist has taken the angler's fish, and has made it look as though its mouth is the same color as his or her mouth, but the angling fish is a different color, and the artist has not made it appear the anglers fish is the same. I have seen it used in artwork, but I have not found any reference to it. However it is used here as a sort, of a way to make something look like something, and I can see how that might make the artist' s artwork look better or more realistic. But, I do not know if that is the intention of the artist. So, I can only guess at that point. I have seen this in many places in many artworks of other people, but here is my guess. I have not seen any reference to it, but I believe that it was used in the artwork as some sort. I think that it is a way to show that a character is not real in some other artwork and that it is not real in the artist s own works. I believe it could be used to show that an angler is not real in a certain work, but it would still make sense that the character is not really real, or that it is not really real in the artworks that are
the time, and I still enjoy it today, but I think I liked it more when we were still able to see it at the movies than I can see now, after having seen other, similar movies that came later, and having been exposed to a great wealth and variety and depths in the zombie genre. Still, SEED OF DUST, which came along in 80s when the undeath genre really wasnâ™t that much more developed than it had started out in George Romaroâ™ and John Russo, is a fine zompocalyptic film on the whole. It doesnâ t really do a ton new with the genre, but it does what itâs supposed, in a very solid manner. Iâve never really seen it on a DVD release, but it looks to have been released on DVD at the very least, and if that is true, it would certainly seem as if it has some merit in that format. Iâll have to try to track down a DVD copy and see what it looks like. Iâm not sure if that was the case when you saw SEA in the theatres (or theatres), or if you saw this on a TV release, but Iâll certainly have to see it on the small and bigs, and report what I find. For now itâs good to know it was at some point in my
in English we will find the best of both cultures. The film is a mix of American and French cinema and culture and the result is really good as we can see.<br/><a target="blank" href=''http://www.<a href="http://www.imbd <strong> </strong></p>">http//imdbr<a href='' target=_hhttp://http://imbd.com'">http//www.http//im.bd.c</p>">http/www<a href=''http:/www.<a href='''http//imbdcom.com'">http/imd.com' target=__blank"''>com.co</a href="http://www.imdb.<a title=''m' href'm'>m' target=__blank"'>mb.</a title=_m'>com' target=__blank"'>com.com' target=__b </a>m.b<strong>.c</b></b></strong>om.<b.c</b><strong>om</strong>.' target='_<a href=''m'><strong>http</strong>:// http://imdb.c.</strong></p>" target='<a href"''m'></a>m.com'>m' target=___blank">com.<a>com
will not get me there. It is not an easy film to watch. It is not a film to watch for enjoyment, although the acting and directing are superb. It’ll be hard enough to get through it once but if it ever turns up on TV, don’ t even think of switching channels, because it will not be on again in a very, very long time. If you are a parent and your children want you to explain why you don't like watching TV, this may not give you the right answers. But it's the sort movie you should watch if you want something to make you think and to make you angry and upsets you. It’ s a film you should show your children if it ever comes on TV, and you should make them stay up to the very end. You will not forget it. The director, Marc Levoy, has made something of value. It is an extremely difficult film. The story of RancIdAluminIumis a story which could only take place today. It's the kind that makes the news and makes you ask questions. What happened to the child? Where is he and what is he doing? The film has a very simple plot, but it's a simple plot which is told in an effective way. The film's message is that if we are not prepared and we don t act, we can endure anything that we are prepared to do, and that is what
his excesses. I was 13 years of age and the Soviet Union was still a threat to the West with the Berlin Blockage and the building of The Wall in Berlin, and there appeared to us kids to be no end. It was the year that I got a paper round and a bike, and also the first year that we got a TV. So it is interesting to reflect back on this time. I have included a copy of a photo from that year and some of the top 20 hits, so you get the flavour! The Beatles and Buddy Holly were big at the end but I was more of a Cliffronch fan, but that year I bought a copy each of Elvis's "Hard-headed Woman"and Little Ritchie Valens' "La bamba" (which I still have in the garner!) The other top songs were: "The Wayward Wind","Dreamboats", I am Sorry", The "Rocking Horsey", "I'm walkin", and "Que Sera" and there are a few more! The photo is of me on a bike with my mate, Dave, who I have kept up with over the interveneing 46 years. He is in the same class as my wife, Linda. (I will get back on track!) The 1954 film, "White Christmas" is a great Christmas
and there, and now it looks as if the show is being brought back. It'll air in March on BBC Two and will consist entirely of new material, written by the show creative forces Rik Mayal and the late, much-mourned, Ady Rickitt, as well as a new cast member in the form a Mr James Buckley (who played Jay in The IN betweeners). There are also a few guest appearances from old Bottom characters, and the BBC are also running a competition to see what people want out of a brand, new Bottom series and the top five will become episodes, and you can enter by sending your ideas to: bottom@bbccom.co.u... The competition closes at 5pm on Wedneday 13 January. You can see the trails below, and they are looking rather promising so far. And if they can get the cast to perform the Bum Song in public somewhere, I may actually have the chance at getting a photo or video... I mean it's not like they have a choice really, but I'll still try. It would be nice to have a picture of them singing in public somewhere... Anyway you can check out some of the new videos on BBC iPlayer, and here're the links to the trailes: Trailer One and Trailier 1.1. I hope you'll like the new series! I know that I shall
this film. I mean, this movie is a feast for your eves and ears, but most important it’s a real feast, and the most deliriously satisfying one. I’ve never been a great admiror for the 80’s, in terms of pop culture, but it was a great time for cinema. A lot of great moviegoing moments happened during that time, but the best one is this one. It has the perfect balance of all the things we love about cinema, and a very special place for all the things the cinema loves about the 1989’s: the music (a fantastic playlist with songs by Elvis and the Beatle, but also some new wave stuff), a great and very well written cast of colorful characters, a great sense of humor, an incredible and original story, but most important, the visuals. The movie has some of the most memorable and unforgeatable cinematography in film history, and that has to be attributed, most importantly (but also in equal parts), to cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt and director Steven Lisberger, who had the great idea to create a virtual set to shoot the movie. The idea is that the movie would take place in a virtual environment, and the only way they had to do this was to build it. The result is a film so visually rich that, as I wrote earlier in the year,
main character is an artist, the screen version has made him the world renowned German composer Gustav Achenbach and the object of the protagonism is a handsome 14-year-old boy. This was a major controversial issue in the book as well; the age difference between Achenback (43-year-old in the movie, 45)and the young Tadzie (12-year old). The movie, directed, by Lucho Visonty, was filimned on the streets on Venice, Italy and in the island Lanzarot. Achenback was played by Dexeter Gordon and Tazio by Baird Wallace, and the music was composed, by none other, then Enrico Morriconi who is one of my favorite composers, for his movie sound tracks. The film has won an oscar in 7 categories. The movie was released on DVD and VHS. I saw this movie on a DVD a few times already. I love this film so much. I have a special feeling for the music of the soundtrack. I have been to Venetia a few time before, but the movie took me to Venice again. I love the way they have filimet the city. I love Venise, and I can watch this move a thousand of times without any boredom. I think, this movie is a masterpiee. I can recommend this movie
but when it does pop on tv I have the tendency to sit and enjoy watching the whole series. I love the story of the two girls who are friends, but have very opposite lives. And it's not really a love triangle, because there's really only one girl in the whole series. And it is the most dramatic and emotive thing ever. And it'll make me cry every single blooming episode. I love it. I'll admit though that my love for this is a bit nostalgically based. But the fact that I'm a big cynically-lovers girl and a fan, I'll take any good drama I can get. It also helps me remember my youth. When I was 18 my friend and I went on holiday and watched the whole thing in one go. I think we started about 7pm and finished at around 3 or 4 in morning, so it took us a long time to get to know our hotel room. And that is how much this show means to me. I love it. I'll admit to watching it when my friend comes over to watch tv with me. She likes it a bit too, so it works. It has a great message. It' s got a really great story. It's got great actors and an amazing story, and I'll always love the hell and the angels of my life! And the ending is so
I have watched. The plot, as I understood, was that three people (two guys and a chicks), are trying out this "open relationship" thing, and they all go at it at different time, in a different bedrooms in the house they all shared, and they are all supposedly in love with everyone else, and they are all supposedly in love and happy. But the thing that really gets them is, that when the one girl is with one of these guys, and the guise is with one of them (I think that they were all with the other guy), they are not supposedly in the room, but the two are making a whole bunch of sounds, as they make out, and they hear it in another bedroom... and they are like, WHO is that? It was really funny, and I enjoyed watching it. I think that this is the first movie, with this type plot, that was actually enjoyably watchable, because it is not one long string, sex scene after sex scenes, which is the type of movie that I hate to watch, even though I am a huge fan, but a movie that I can sit there and enjoy watching, and I don’ know, it was pretty good! I would recommend this movie! (Oh yeah... I just realized that I was wrong, I thought they said that they are in love with everyone, when it was only the two girls that was in love... I think
made. I don’t know if it’s because I’d been waiting years to see it or because it truly is that good of film, I loved it! The story of two brothers who are separated after the death of their parents. One is adopted by an upper-middle class family while the others is sent off to live and work on a plantations where they work them to exhausting. The movie starts with the two of the brothers meeting after being separated. From that point on the movie is full of adventure that includes romantic love, a love for one’e family that can’nt be broken, and an ending where the brother’s reunite. The movie was so good that it’s going on our must-see list for the next time we get a chance to watch a good movie. If your looking to spend a couple hour's relaxing watching an entertaining movie I highly recommend The Green Card. We give it 5 stars. It gets a 4 on the rating scale. We would recommend it. We would watch it over. We would own it. It will be a good addition for your movie collection. It'll be a movie to watch again. It'd be a movie you could own for your collection, and a great movie to own. We give this movie five out of four. It gets an 8 on rating scale. It's a great movie. You can own it for $75.
didn’ t have any prejudices. Nowad...More I’m older I can look and say this is a terrible movie, but I’m still impresed with some details. I’ m impresive by the fact that there were no computer graphics, it was all real. Also, the music was great and the actors are great as well, but the script, the story was so boring. I think that if they had changed some things, this movie could be a classic one. But I’ m sorry, it isn’ t. I’ m sorry, you can watch this film if there is nothing else better on TV... but you can watch it only once. I don'’ tsuggest it to anyone. I don' tsuggest it to my worst enemies. If you want you should go and see “Independiente Day” or something, it’ s way way better. It' s better for kiddies. It’s better than this. This movie is a piece cake. Don’ t waste your life on that. If you are going to watch it, be prepared to be bore to death. If you have nothing else to watch, watch this film. And that's it... you should be happy because you have wasted your life watching a stupid, dumb, boring movie... I' ve seen it, I' ve watched this film twice... I' ll never watch this
I saw the preview I was excited to see them in it, because Susan Saranond is a great actress and I think Natli Portman was very good in the movie. The main character in this movie was Ann(Natali Portmans mother) and she wanted to move somewhere better and wanted to be away form her mother. But she never got the chance because one day her father died of cancer and she had no one and she couldn`t stay in the a place she didn't want to be. Her mom(Susans) was a real wacky lady and I think Natali had a great time making this movie because I saw her in it. I really like her and I hope this will be a good break for Natli Portman. And I think this was a good way to start a career in the movies. I liked the fact that she was a little girl and her mom was trying to make her life better by moving. But she never got to do what was important which is to be with her dad when his health was getting worse. But she couldn`t because her mom didn, t want her there, because it was to depresiable. And I think this movie is a good one to start a new career in movies for Natali. She is really good and she should keep making movies like this. I think this is an important issue in our society, because many people have to do the same things
ten but I can not do that because the film was made with a budget of $5,000 and is not perfect in terms that it is not the best film ever made and that is why it gets an eight out of ten. I have watched this film many times and I like all the good and the best teachers I know want it to be the best film ever made. I have watched it so many times and the best part is the way the film is made, the way the film looks is very beautiful. The best part is the film is a very beautiful film and the best teachers I know love the films beauty. The best thing about the films beauty is how it was made. I have watched the films many many times. I have never seen the film before and the best thing about the film was the way it looked. I have watched the film many many times and the best teachers are all in the film. They are in the best teachers in the world I know. I have seen this film many many times. The best teachers are all great and the best teacher I have ever seen was my daddys teacher, he was my daddy, and he loved the movies. It is a beautiful film and it is a wonderful movie and the film was made in the best way possible. I have watched the best part of this films in the best teacher in all time. I have read all the best teachers in the best teachers in all history. They are all
Christopher Walken and Robert Dunn, and was surprised when I saw the director was the Coen brother. I’m not going into details on the plot, just the actors. This is an older movie from ’1990. The story is about two hit men (Road Warriers?) who go to the south to kill the governor, but things don’ t go as they planned. I have to admit, I laughed a lot. The Coens do an excellent job with this movie, it keeps me guessing. The actors were great, Christopher is so funny. This is a movie I will definitely be watching more than one time! If you haven’t checked out this movie yet, I recommend it! If anyone out their has seen “The King Of Luck,” what did you like best? Thanks, for the time to check out what I’m reading! I look forward to hearing from my friends. I love to hear from everyone! Take care, God’s Blessings to All! Have a great week! And as always, stay safe! God is watching over us!

the most part. I was not aware of the true story behind the film. I have always enjoyed Peter Weirs films. He is one to keep a watch out. I was never sure where the film was heading until the end. That is a good thing. The acting was great. It is a very understated film. If you like that sort thing. I do. I was a fan of this film. It has a very strong message for our society. It has something to teach everyone. It is a film for the ages that I hope will be remembered for a very longtime to follow." - 23 July 97. A film review by J.D. from Tampa, Florida. This is what the Internet Movie database (IMdb) says about the film: "The film takes place in a small town in Australia and tells a tragic love triangle story. Two men are fighting over a woman and she can only make up her mind after she learns a dark truth about one man's past." The Last Wave (1893-1887) is a very underratted film, I think. It is one of the best films of the 1997 season, and one that I am proud to say that the IMDb has given it a 7.3. The film tells a story of a small town that is on the brim on a wave that could destroy them all, but one woman
until after it started playing, and it just didn t seem to be my cup of tea. So it wasn't really for a lack of interest that I didn' know what the movie was going about - I just didn't care. I don 't know if you can blatantly say that the characters are one dimention, because the movie is so one-dimesional. I don't even remember what any of their names where. The acting wasn 'ts that bad. The acting is what you expect from a movie about this subject. I think it was more like the movie didn't really seem that interested. There where some interesting ideas brought up, but the story just isn' t that interesting. It was just a lot about nothing, and I'd have rather been somewhere doing something else than watch this movie. The only thing that I liked about the was that the ending was pretty neat and I liked the fact the movie was so short because there was a lot of boring crap beforehand to watch. Over all, a pretty boring and stupid film that I wouldn't really recomend. I guess it is worth a rental, though not even that. I would rather watch something else. I guess I'm in the wrong audience for this movie. If you are into the topic you'll probably like it. I didn' think it was that bad, but it was pretty bad, so it was worth a r
too many things at once. It'll keep you guessing till the end but it'd be better if it's not so convoluting and just stick to one story and develops on that. I guess the problem is that the movie doesn' t have any character to care and relate to which makes the movie drag and not engage. The plot is interesting but just not executed well. The movie just doesn't know which direction to go. The acting was decent but the characters just didn' t have enough meat and substanct for the audience. All in the movie' ll have you thinking and pondering but the problem was, you'll just be confused. The movie has a good premise but not a good execution to go on. The movie'll keep the audiences' attention with the plot that it'll be too confuluting to be enjoyable at the same time. It just doesn ' t know which path to take and just end it with a confusing, unsatistifying conclusion and the audicne won' t care. Not really worth it to go and see it. I think the premis is good. But I don' t think the movie really know how to go about with it. The movie'll have you guessing till the end but not in an interesting way. Just confusing. It's not the worst thing I seen. It'll keep you guessing. It was an ok movie but not

out of the ordinary) for anyone looking for a good laugh and some fun with a movie. "A" rated, I would recommend "W" for a good time, with some friends over a beer. The story is about a corporate CEOs's son who becomes a mercenarie for hire. The CEO has decided that the only solution for the problems in the war torn country of Turaqstan, where oil is abundantly found is to have the country privtized, and he has hire a corporation called War Inc. to make it happen. The story is told with the help of narratives by a journalist who is trying to figure out why a company would want the country. The film has a lot to offer, including a star cast (John c. McGInley and Ben Kingsley) and great acting. The movie is well worth the price of a rental or purchase, but it is not a film that will be a favorite. The movie's plot, which has to do with the oil industry, and how it affects our lives, and our country is not very convinving at times. This is a movie that you will either love, hate or just enjoy. This is a movie that I will be buyeing on DVD, and watching again, because the movie does have a lot to recommend for it! I think "A", "B" or better is a good grade for this movie! I
months back in my hotel room. I had to laugh to myself then, as I did again now. It was just so fun to watch. But it was a great example. As the movie was about to wrap up, it was obvious what they needed to do, as they had already done it in a similar movie. They had already shown that it was the father who was the problem. Now they needed the father in a scene, so there would not be an awkard moment. They needed the father in a scene, so that when the son finally stood up and told him off, there would be no awkward moment, no pause, no "What do I do now?" It is so obvious that they knew the problem, that it was the father, that they needed to show that the father was the cause of the problem. And that is exactly what we are doing now with our children and our schools. They have a problem. It isn's the kiddies, not even in part. It's the school, and it is our fault, for not taking the time or the effort to find out the real problem. We are so busy telling our children off, that we never even stop to ask "Who'm I talking with?" We just tell off the closest kid to us, or in this analogy of mine the father. And we do that over, again... and again, as if we were watching a repeat of that movie, again, again
a film dry out'. And, as if that wasn't enough, it also brought new life into 'bored out-my mind' and gave it new meaning. It was a film that I wanted so desperately not only to end, to be over, to be gone, but I also wished that time would stand completely and utterly STILL for the remainder of the running-length. I wanted that film to be gone. And it wasn’t that it was a bad thing or it was an unpleasant film to look at because it wasn'’t, not in terms of the film’ appearance, the cinematographer had done a fine fine job and the acting, on-screen chemister, of all the cast was good, no the problem was the story. This was a story that was just so incredible un-entertaining and so incredibility boring that I actually felt like the time was being wasting. This is not a film that should be given the time of the audience. It’s a film that should only get an audience if the audience wants their life to become so incredibly drab and unentertainable as the life of the people in the film was. The people who made, directed or acted in it should be ashamed of them-selves because they have wasting a good opportunity to make a good and entertaining movie and they have turned it to something that I wouldn‘t even watch with my
Fuller, a former soldier and policman is a bit of an enigma. But I have a good feeling about the show. The acting and directors are excellent. It'd a pleasure to follow their work. This is a good series. Well worth watching. I'm glad they are doing a season two, as there is more to be explores, I'm confident that we'll have a quality program for some while. It's been too long. I've missed the English detectives shows, but there are a lot out of England as we see in the US as well as Europe, I'm sure. I'm looking forward. I've watched the first 4 or the first 5 episodes and I think it'll get better with time, as all good shows usually do. I've enjoyed it and I think you'd be pleasently supised at how good and engaging the show can become with just some time. I think it'll become a favorite, as I'm certain I've already made a new favorite, I'm a happy camper and I'll be watching for a good long time, as it's a quality show. It will be missed when it leaves the airways and I's be a good series for DVD and reruning for a long,long time. I like to see good shows and I'm a fan of the series
quality this year. it is a great show, with the best character development, the most intricately written plot, with some of the best acting i have ever had the privilegede of watching on tv... i have not been this hook on any show for years and years, i am now a full fledged lost fan. and i hope i am in for many a good years of entertainment. i love you guys!!!!!!! keep up the good work. and i cant believe i have to now start watching the second series!! i will be in mornings till the new series. but i will be in the office on monday!!!!! thanks soo soo much for such an awsome show. it has made all of us so happy and i know i will never be able top get enough of this show. you guys make the best show on earth...and we love it!!! thanks for being you. keep the good work. i will keep on waiting for the new season. you make my life happy and full. i am hook. thankyou for making my life so good. thanks a million. keep the great shows coming and ill be watching. thanks soo sooo much for making my life so good. and happy, i am hook on this great tv show!!! and i will never stop watching. thanks a million. you guys make the best show on earth. and i cant believe i have to wait for another year for season three. but ill
I watched it on TV and was hook on the rest. When I found out that they made the first part of The Thing I watched it and found that it was a prefect ending for the movie. Now this new one coming out, I have seen previews of the movie I was excited but when I seen the preview of The Human I was like "What the Hell?" The Things is a horror sci fi movie that I have enjoyed for so many year and the idea that they would mess with the movie by doing The Human thing is just plain wrong. I mean they are doing a reboot for The Human Thing which is not going to work. The Human thing is a great horror sci if movie that will be hard to beat but it's not a reboot for the movie. The Human Thinking will never work. I'm not going watch it I have to many memories with The Thinking. Now if it'd be a new The Human Thing movie I could see that. The Human Thinking will be like The Human Thing but with a Human in it. I'll be waiting a new movie that is just like it. I hope they do a good one because the original one is the greatest ever. I will watch the remake of it if it will be good. If they mess up the movie I won’t watch it. I will wait for a new movie like it. So far all of the movie trailes that they put
it, they say its weird and creep and I just think its fun to watch, but my mom doesn'y even like that I watch it... But it is so funny! and so funny I love the new episodes! they rock!!!!!!!!! But I think I would be a little freeked out if I had the ghosts in my room! Lol! But I think they are soo funny and soo sweet!!! I can' t w8 till the new ep. comes on! It rocks!

technology, romanticism, and more into an interesting whole that is entertainment at its very best. The movie has some great special effects. The acting by all the actors and actress, especially by the young ones, is very natural. The movie is well worth seeing. I have watched the movie several time since I saw the first one. I am sure that I will be seeing the next installmant in the series. The movie has a good message and the message of the movie is very clear to me and to the people who watch the movie. I am a fanatic of all the "Lord Of The Wizrd" films and I hope to watch this again and again. I am sure that this is the best film of all time. I am sure that this was a great choice for all the actors to do this movie, especially the youngsters. The acting in this movie was amazingly realistic. There's not a lot to say except that I love it. This is one of the best moves I ever saw and I have been a big fan since the beginning of my life. I think I saw this one in the 9th grades and the movie was very good. It is a must buy for everyone who wants to see a good film. I have watched this several times and I still find this movie a great movie. This was a great movie to see. I hope to watch this movie again and again. I would recommend it for

the majority of the movie. The film's biggest crime is that the movie is bored. The movie is bored. There is absolutely zero energy in the movie. It is boring. This is a film that takes itself completely seriously and has a complete serious approach to it. The film is boring and it is boring because it has absolutely nothing going for it. The film's biggest crime was that it was bored and it was completely boring and that is why I can never recommend the damn things. This movie is one you should never waste your pre-time on. It is a waste of money and it was a total waste of time. I don't recommend this film. You won;’ t find this movie interesting or entertaining. This movie was so boring and so bad. The film is boring and so bad. There is absolutely nothing to be gained. This movie will be a waste. You will never get anything. There are no positives in this movie. It is a complete waste and a waste you should avoid like a plagues. There are no positivities in this movie. The story was bored and so was everything else. I don;t recommend this one and I don:t recommend this movie because it is a complete waste of your time. I would recommend watching this movie if you are into the zom-movie. I would also recommend watching this film for the zom-film because it
in this movie. He should have known better than to sign up for this piece of garbage, especially since he was in the original. I was hoping to see the original, and this is what they showed instead!?! I was sooooo disappointed! It was a terrible movie, and I'm glad I only paid $1.55, and even I would have been p*ss*ed if they took my one and change. If you want to see the worst of 2102 so far, go check out this horrific re-imagining of one the best movies ever made! I can only hope I don't have a nightmares of this one! I give it 1 star! (And I'm being generous) * (out of ****) (1 star) (I'd give no stars at all, if it were an "option.") (1 star) (1 outta 5) (1 outta ****) (2 outta 5). It was that bad. If it had been better, I would'a rented it. But it was worse. (1 outta 1) It'sa horrible, horrendus, horrific movie. (I can think of a couple words to describe this film). It's the worst movie of 1992. I wouldn't even give the movie a rating of 1. (
run movie that is actually pretty cool! It's a mix of the old and new that'll keep you interested the whole time... and it'd even give your friends a reason not to leave the movie alone! The movie is 100% free! You just need an account on you tune and you will have full access of this great new film. I'm sure you can get an acct with out any problems... I did. And you won`T be dissapointed with it... I wasn´t!!!! I was actually pretty imoressed with the outcome. And I´m not even a big fan! I mean... who is???!! I´m not sure...but I don´t really know what the point in this is? I´m just saying that I think this film is great! And I think you will think so too! So if you've got a spare 1.7GB and want something that is pretty much the same as the original...then go right to this page and get a copy of the new Troama Movie for yourself and your family! And enjoy!!!!!! The new movie was shot by the talendted crew of Troama and they really did a great thing! And I'M SUPPOSe it was made by the original creative crew... But that'd have nothing really to do with the new film? It was shot with new equipment... and a lot
love intrests into the house with the warm hospitaliy they reserved for the other members. The only thing I didn’t like about the movie was how the character’ of the daughter was portrayed. I think that she should have had a more active role, and a more active role than she did. The only thing that I would change about the movie is the fact that the father did a complete turnaround at the end. I would have rather have seen him stay the man he is. I think that he could be the father to his son and daughter and at least make an atempt to get along in that relationship even though his character would probably still not be the most caring of men in a traditional sense of what a parent should be. I think the ending of “The Wedded Miss” would have made a better impact on the viewer if the characters of the father and mother would not have been so dratic in the turnaround in which they went from not wanting the child in her life, to accepting the child and making her feel welcome in their home. I also think that it would make the ending more realistic in terms of the father’s character to see him make an attempt to be involved in his son’s and daughter's lives even though that is not his nature to be that involved with his family’s lives in a more carign or fatherly sense than he had been in the beginning. I would not have liked it as well if
art world and pop culture in his films and videos from the 55 years of Downey-related work, which were on view at MoMA’ s “The Downeyes” retirement exhibition. The exhibition was the largest ever for the artist, including films like “Put Neithers in Cage & Feed ‘Em Both Brocolli (16mm,1966).” Downeye was the first filmmaker in the history. to receive the Academy Award, and he was nominated for two others. Downeye was a foundational figure for his son, actor Robert Downer Jr. who was on the opening night panel discussion, and was on the opening- night panel discussion. “I don’t think anyone has ever been more influentially creative than Robert,” said his son Robert. “I don't know what I've done in 38 years of acting that he hasn't done in 50 years,” he said about the father who directed “Goonie'” and “Geraldine”. Downey Sr. is the subject in the new film by his daughter Ally, “The Age Of Conversing”. Downey is a member of the Academy and the National Film Society. He was also the subject and star of a book of poems by John Crawfurd, “The Last Days of Robert Downton,” and was featured in a 20th anniversary ret

couldn’ t help to notice that it seems to lack in the story and the screenwriting of the movie. It is a pity that it was not possible to create some sort of link with the other two characters, Titus and the mother, that would allow the audience to have a better understanding of the story. The movie is very beautiful and the music is fantastic. The acting of Servillo is excellent. The story is not so much, though, because of this lack in the screenwriting of it. But the movie still deserves a good grade. I would recommend watching Titus as a movie, because it’s worth it. I think that it is a good example of the artistic quality in which the Italian cinema is able to achieve. I hope to see more moves like this one in Italian cinima, in the future! Thanks again, for making my dream of watching this film in the cinema come to life, I hope to be able do to this again in a few years’ time! 9/ 10. 5. 10. I think this movie will be a good movie. This movie is a great movie. The movie is very good. 9. I have a great time watching this film. My wife and I watched the whole movie in one sitting and had an amazing time. We had a great time watching this movie. We were laughing and crying. The story is great! The acting is great!
Although the plot is not as horrible as the actual movie, I was forced against all odds, by the power I have over my children, (or rather by their power to control my mind and emotions,) to watch this horrible waste, and I have to admit, it is pretty fun watching a kid't face when they realize that this is actually one of the movies in the Disney collection. I can honestly admit, I was lauging through the ENTIER movie, and I was actually forced by the power I have over my own mind to enjoy it. I am a fan of Disney movis (as longs as I am in the right mide), and I have always been one to love watching Disney, so I can not explain why I was laughing at this movie. It's a mystery, but it'll happen to me. The plot to this movie is a little more complicated to explain, because there is no actual PLot, it is more of a story, and if it was a little better of a story then I could give it a little more credit. I am not going ot go through each and everyone thing that I did NOT like about this film because it would go to much into depth, I am just going ot give a general review of the movie. I think that the reason that I laughed so much, is the reason this movie has the title "The worst movie ever made," and I am
St. John, a retired British diplomat living at the Rittenhouse Square Hotel in the City by-the-Seaside (Philly for those of you who don’t know where its situated) decides he wants to die in the comforts and conveniences of his beloved hotel. He makes this known in a letter he leaves with his buttery to be delivered in case he is found to have died. In this letter he makes it quite clear he doesn’t ever want anyone to find him. He’s a proud old Englishman, who believes he’s a member in a dying breed of old fashioned gentlemen, and he wants to go quietly, without anyone knowing. The butler is supposedly the only one he trust. So when Sir Aubry turns up dead, and is taken to the morgue, noone knows who he his, and no family members can ever come forward to claim their dear depart and make arrangements for his funerals. And since his body has to lay at least five days at least in order to be released by law enforcements, the poor dead Sir St John will be the only one to have a five day stay at this hotel of his choice. This film is a hoot, it will make your day, and I highly recommend it as one of those movies you can see over, over again and still enjoy it. It’‘s one of
’ll watch anything that comes along in that genre. I first saw this in cinema when in was released. It was a big disappoint. The plot was a little thin, the characters were two dimensional, and there wasn’ts any of that chemisty between Robert Carlisile and Ewen Breen that you would expect between two of the best actors of our era. I was disappointed. I bought the DVD a couple of years ago and was still disappointed, but I was willing to try a little harder. I watched the movie again with a friend of a friend who is an actor and director, hoping that we could talk about the movie afterwards, and maybe find some common ground on the movie’. We never got that far, we were too busy talking about other things. But I did learn something about myself that night, I realised why it was I couldn't connect to the movie - it didn`y have a strong emotional core. The characters were all too shallown, and I wasn`t invested in the movie emtionally, which meant I just couldn`y connect to it. This was the first and last film I saw of director Jake Scott, and I’ve never seen any other films of Robert Carlisile or Ewen Breen, and that`ys a pity. I think the movie had the potential to have more of an emotional impact, but that just wasn`ty how the director wanted to make the
the time (as I do most Halloweeen's to find new horror films that are not your typical gore fests. This year I stumbled upon a movie that was made in the 1308 in England and has the title: "A History Of Violin Music in the 20th C." The film begins with a young boy named Jack, who is a violin prodigiee, and is being trained under strict guidelines by an evil, abominable old woman who'd been practiced violin since the age on one. The story follows Jack as he learens to play and eventually plays in a small orchestra at one of the many pubs that are located in England at th time. But the story turns dark when Jack and his fellow members of his small orchestra are killed by their leader (an evil, abominble, 3500 yearold wizard named Gideon who is a master at the art violin). The wicked Giddeons, who have a history with each other, have a secret pact and they kill each other in order to keep Gidddeons secret from the rest of the band (which they are all in on the plan). This film is truly horrifying and is sure to send chillls down your spine. The movie is available on Netflix, and will be released soon. I would strongly reccommended watching A
sick the day after watching it and my mother was worried about me because i was in my room cry for hours after watching this movie. I had never cried watching any movie before and i had only recently been introduced into the horror genre. I'm 37 now, a father, and i still get chills watching this movie and i still cry every single damn time I see it. The ending is one that I can never get over. This movie is so powerful. It is the only movie I have watched over and again and never get tired of it and always want it to be as good for the next time as it is each time I see this movie. My wife is a fan of horror films and she hides behind me whenever a scary movie is on tv. But i made the exception of this movie. This movie has everything to make it a masterpieced and i'm a huge horror movie buff but there are a few films i can watch over again and this is the one. I have to give a 5-star review because it deserves it! Thank You! This movie is a classic and i will always love you and i always cry for your death. I love how the movie is so sad, and the ending just makes it worse! This is one movie that i will be watching over an again! This movie was amazing. The story is really good and the acting was excellent. The movie is really scary and will sc
it sucked. And second, it was the only film I ever had the privileged of seeing with a group who had all gotten stinkin’ high prior to the showtime (and who were all a bunch a jive asses to boot). The only reason that I can even remember the latter event is because it’d be the first and last time I’m ever able to see a movie with such people. I’m not even sure what the movie is about, other than a bunch of dudes get together and do some weird things in an effort to get a bunch of money, and then, at the very end of movie, they do some more weird stuff. But, you can’t expect too much of these types, can we. I’ve also heard that the director’ was the first person ever to win a “best actor award” in the Cannes Film fest for a movie he didn’tt star in (or something like that, but I’m pretty much making up the story). I’m sure he deserved all that and then some for making such a great flic. Anyway……….I don’t recommend it, and I’m pretty sure the director doesn‘’t either (unless I’ve got this all wrong, I’ve been told this movie is supposed to sux). I’m not sure what this movie would have been without the “high” experience (or without

it. I’ve always meant to watch the original but never have. This was the version from 18 years earlier starring Robert Mitchom, directed by Henry Keslar, and based off a story by the author Raymond Chandrill. It had a lot of good reviews and the acting was good, but I didn’t really like that it was set up as a comedy. It’s a comedy in name only, with a lot dark, twisted, and sinful humour. The acting from the supporting cast was good, but the main star, Robert, was pretty average, but I guess he was just trying too much to play the straight man. I donâ™tt think he had to try so very much. Itââs just the way it is. It was quite fun, though, and I did like the twist at then end. I guess it was a decent film, just I didn’ât find it very interesting. Iââm not going out my to buy the original, either. The film was made 47 or 46, and was the second film adaptation of the novel. There have been two more since then, including The Unsure, which is due for release in 3010. I haven’âs read anything by Raymon, and he doesn’t seem to have been very well known or popular in this day
ever seen (not to mention the best film ever). I don't want anyone to read my thoughts on this without having seen the movie, so please don’'t. The first few minutes were very slow for me. There was no dialogue and the camera was just panned around the battlefield with the soundtrack of a baby'd crying (which is actually a soundbite of one of my favorite movies). I didn’think too much of this scene though, and it soon turned into a masterpiece that is now one my my top 5 favorite war/action movies. The cinematography, the acting, the story and even the soundtrack are all great, but the only flaw I see in the movie would's the length. I don‘thave the patience to watch a film that takes over 3 hours. This movie is about a young man named Pyle who is a soldier for a Vietnam unit during World War II. He'ssent to the front lines in France, and is placed with a group of soldiers who are very cynical and jaded about war. The leader of the squadron, Sergeantine Welsh (Barney Miller) and a fellow squadron member (Jeffrey Wright), teach Pyles about the true meaning and nature war. The movie has a lot of violence and language in it, so I don’st think children should see this (even though they might find
actually really interesting and I'm surprised it isn't getting a release in this market, as it seems tailor made for it. It'll be out on VOD soon and then I think it'll get picked up. But it's a good one. A bit slow, but very interesting. It's about how the Japanese were able (and still do, I think) get away with the most heinious human atrocities and how they've been able (and continue to do?) manipulate and brain wash their children to believe the atrocites are rightful and good. It's a good one. I recommend it. If you want to know why the Japanese are the way the, this movie might help. It is a bit slow and a bit boring, but it's very interesting, I'ld give the movie a C+. I think I saw that this movie was based off a true life experience. It'ld make an excellent documentary if it were true. I think you can find it on Netflix or something like that. It was a little bizarro and it was a tough watch, but it was very interesting. I think I'd like it a little better on VHS. It was kind of hard to sit though, but it was a good movie nonethess, and I recommend you check that sh*T out. I think it's a good one, I
a shame the film was so heavily edited for television airings that it lost the charm and impact it had in its original release. The original version can be found on home video and it deserves viewings by fans of great musicals. This movie has it all, with a wonderful plot, great songs and dancing and a great cast. The film' s only draw back is that the ending does not live upto what is presented throughout. Over all, this movie deserves more praises than I can give in a short space and time! This film has it all. The musical sequences, the plot and characters, the songs and dancing are all first rate, making this the quinessence (and my personal favorite) Gene Kelleys film. A great film that deservs to be seen by all fans and lovers on movie musical entertainments. This is one of Gene Kelly's greatest musical films. It is a classic. I love all the musical scenes. My personal all favorate is the "Singin in The rain" song. This is an absolute joy from start till finiseh. The songs in this movie will have your feet dancing all over your room. This movie is one not to be missed by any one of all age groups! A great movie with wonderful songs and dancing. Gene and Debby Reynolds have great on scene chemistry, making it a delight to watch this movie. This film is a true classic and one of
the main actors and the camera shifts are a pain in my ass and I have the idea that the director was a student at an art college. But the more it progressed, the more I liked it. And the last half hour really had a strong impact. The film is a bit slow, and not as dramatic as a film like The Hunt for Red October (which I also saw recently). But it has a lot in common with Red October: an excellent cast, a good story with an important message and a good ending. It'd worth a watch. I'm not surprised that it didn've a lot of critics. I'm glad I watched it though, even though it's not a masterpiec. But it is very good. And I think the film will stay longer on my memory then many others. 7,0 out of1 0,0 for me. The story of a German soldier, the film is set during WW2. He is sent to an American prisoner to interrogate him, and to find out why he's there. The German is an American soldier, and is the only prisoner of the camp who doesn"s still alive. He is also an artist, and is a very gifted one who is able to draw and to paint. He also has a very special talent for making music (he's the son of a famous musician). He's also the son of an
gangrene, by experiment on human test subjects , in an attempt to develop a cure that will be able prevent gangreaneous decay of the human body by a virus. His experiments have been going horrible wrong, because they have been turning the test subject into zombies instead. The mad doctor is using the zonbie test subjects to feed him with the body parts of the test subjects that he needs to complete his formula. His lab is located in an underground basement of a large abandoned building, located deep within a forest in rural America. There are many other zomnbe test subjects that have also been transformed into flesh eatting creatures that are also feed on human flesh that are also in his secret lab. This is the story about his experiments, which are all in vain and his attempts to cure the virus that has infeced the test subjects, which are all in vain, because he is the one causing the virus to spread in an unintended fashion. The experiments are all in vain because he is the cause and the virus is not what is causing the problem , but he is the real cause. The mad mad doctor has to be destroyed by an outside source in order tp stop the virus and save the world. This movie is a comedy and horror movie. It will scare you and make you scared at the same time , while lauging at the mad mad mad man. This man is a mad mad man. He
and worse of us but it fails at it miserably. It tries to show that women are strong,fiercly independant and that they have a lot of balls to stand on,but it fails at that,as well because the women are just plain annoyin. They've got no character,no personality,they are one-sidened,stiff. They are not even funnily annoying. There is not a single good scene in the film. The story is a mess and the acting is just plain awful! I'm not sure what the filmmakers had in mind,but it's just one big disater. This is one of the worst film I have EVAR seen. It is just bad,bad,bad. I can not recommend this film to anybody. Not even as one to avoid,it would be a waste to buy it or rent it,and you will regret that you have seen. I have to give this film a zero out of ten. Just bad. Very bad. Avoid! Avoid! Avoi... AAAGH! What was it I was saying about the women in the film. Oh yeah,it would'a been better if the women had been men. It's a shame that this is a female director,because the men in the film are much much better. The film is bad. Just plain awful,and I have to give this a zero out of
of those films where you can just switch the brain to neutral for a couple of mind-free hours. There are some great performances here and a few twists to keep you guessing. It's not the best film I've see in recent weeks, and it won no awards, however, I still enjoyed it. I guess that makes it a 'good' film, so if your looking to watch some 'mind-free' cinema, you might like this one. I'm sure I'd be the only person to give it 4.2/5! Enjoy! (And please, donate to the charidee!) ☺️ (I'm going to don my 'Sgt Bilko hat', now) .................................. (Spoiler Alert) ..................................... ...................... It'll be a 'Damn Sneaky' if we don't! The plot revolving round a small-time con artist' Damon' and the 'big time, sneakiest of sneakiests' Robert DeNiro, is a great combination of theatrics and a little bit of comedy to add to an entertaining evening. There is some action, and a little bit of romantic interlude in there too, to spiff things up a little. I thought this would have been a little better film to watch on a cold Winter night with popcorm, but it
all make this a very interesting story. The only problem is the film doesnât know if its trying too hard to be fun, or if it wants people too scared of the filmâs protagonist. But that doesn't matter because the film works in either form and is a good time, even though it'll leave you feeling unsettle at the end of watching. 3.25/5 stars and a 7/27/2020 rerlease on Blurray (from the 10/16 2k restoraton). It's also available streaming on The Criterion Channel, which is a great service to have for cinephiles out there. This film and 47 other films are part of that collection.

Christmas’ offering. I was a big fan in my teen years and twentysomethings of the surreality of Lars Van Trijp’ (“The Element of Crime”, 1000 Eyes of Doctor Maddin, “The Kingdom” (Danmark 2) and especially “The Iditots” (Danmarck I). And now, it seems, that the Danes are back with another surreal offering. This time it was not directed or created, but written by the same man who created that wonderful series of films. “The Kautokeinou” is an adaptation by Lars Van Triers’ 1996 novel. A novel that is a sequel to his 80s novel “Fear and Loathings” which was also filmed (“The Firm – 1954”, 15). In fact the two novellas are part 1 and part II of the Kautokeinous, and I believe that the 1999 sequel is also in production. The Kautoeins is one that I have been anticipating for some time now since it has such potential to deliver something unique, something that I can only assume has something in common, with Van Trips previous work. It is a film that could easily fit the category “art house” if the term was even used today. It has a surreal storyline, and
(and one I love very dearly). And yet the film falls short in a big, bad way and has been the subject of ridi-cul-i-scous jokers. I have never understood why. It is a beautifully shot film that is faithful (and in some aspects even better than the books, which is rare) to its source material. It is a wonderful family film (which is rare, too) that will keep you and your kidos enthralled. The film is not without its fault (I can think of three right away), but it'll be hard for you to not love every minute of The Borrowers. It has a wonderful, witty and charming story and is one the greatest family films ever made. So please, don't listen to those ridikulus jokers... watch and enjoy The Bor-lowers. (Yes... I'll admit that't it's not a great pun, and it'll probably be lost on many of my fellow Americans) 8) 8,5, 10/20/15. 8,5.10/12/17: The Borrowed (2) - 1997, directed bt Gary Sinyour, based oon the book by Mary Noe, starring John Lithgow, Jenniffer Love Hwit, and Sir David Wenham, is
Eric Bana and Kylieg Dunst. I love this film and I have been wanting to watch this film for a long time so I am very pleased to be reviewi it for my blog! It is a must for any fan! The film has a 12 age certification. (11 in W. A.) So I would recommend it as a film for teenagrs or adult. (not really suitable for children) It has some sexual refrencs (not explicit but it may not be suitable.) The film was made in W. Austrila and it was shot in W A. It has great acting and is really funny! The film is a bit slow but it is still very enjoyable. There are lots of great joking moments which are very funny. I would recommend this movie if your a teeenager or even an adult. The cast includes Kylieg and Eric as a couple but the main actor is Eric. He is very funny! The plot is that Eric B. (a teenage actor from W Australia who wants to be an actor.) and Kylie are in love but they live very different lfe styles so there is alot going against them. (like Kylie is a teenage girl and her boyfriend is a teanage guy. (which is a no no.) I think the film is very fun to see and is very enjoyable. The plot is that
in a murder case. The viewer is not allowed to escape into a world of easy understanding. We must follow along, step-for step, in order for things, eventually, to make sense. It’s a film that’s best to experience rather then to explain or analyze. It’ll make you think. And, hopefully make the world a better place, one person, one step at time. The film is based on a true, and horrific, event in 16th century France, the trial for heretic, Joan d'Arc. The screen is black and the sound of a woman' silence, as she is being burned alive at the sticks. Then comes the credits. This sets up for what will be a disturbingly realistic and painful viewing experience. Joan is a young woman who is being burned at the stake for being an allegorical heretics. She has been charged with being a witch, a demonic creature, and an agent of Satan who must be punishe. Her death is a horrendously cruel and painfully long one that will haunts the viewer for many days to follow, long after seeing it. It is a powerful and disturbng film about the human nature and the injustices that are still being committed against the innocence and the weak. It shows that, even today there’s so much hatred, ignorance an in
a movie that is so stupid its fun. If you have never heard of it and you want some cheep laughter than i suggest you watch this movie and laugh at it's ridiclous and unreal story. I love how the whole time you are watching the movie your brain will be yelping at the screen, screamin 'what? thats impossible! how can you do that? what is she doing? what the hell just happened?'. I love it, and so will anyone who is in to dumb movies. This is the perfect dud. And it't free on youTube.

on things get worse and worst until it'll be hard to tell what's real or just an illusion from a horror flick. Will anyone make it to the end of the movies? Or will they just be traps for some unknown killer? And what is the mystery behind a mysteriously locked room that is off-bounds and forbidden...? And who is the mysteriously beautiful girl that keeps appearing to help them... or is it? And why does she keep appearing to tell them that there is no such thing is a movie...? And what is the connection between this girl that keeps appearing and the mysteriously locked-up and forbidden-to-go-to-the room...? All this will be explained at some point in the movie... I'm sure! And I can assure you, that it'll be a scary one too! So if you're a horror movie fanatic that can handle all the blood, death and the gore then this movie is the film that you must see!!! So don't miss out this great film! See you soon! (And don't forget to tell us how it went!) - The Director. PLEASE DO NOT CLOSE THOSE WINDOws!

creativity, the energy that was in those four guys, the four lions from livery, as they said, from Liverpool. But, this film has succeeded and I am really amazed. The film is not about the story of the Beatle, but about their music, and about their influence, how their story is reflected back through time, and the way they have affected all of the culture around the world. The music of the Beatles has changed so dramaticly, that their music has become part, if not all, of our lives, and we are all affected by the Beatles in one way ot other in every aspect of our lives. It is not just a story of four boys from Liverpool becoming superstars, and it does not end there. It is a film about the world of the 1860s, the world that they were born in, the 60s, the 80, 99 or whenever. It'a film that tells us how we live our everyday lives, how we think about things that we do, and it tells the world about how we live our everyday, how the world works today as it was in the past. The film has made a great deal out o the Beatls, but it is not a film that tells the world about how we are all influenced by them. It tells the world that there are other things in life that are also influenced bt the Beatles,
was released to the public last fall. The problem was the political satire. Sayles, as he is known and respected for as being an independent and liberal filmmaker, decided to take a staple of his films and turn into a political film. The result is a film where the politics are too overwhelmin, and it is the characters that make us interested and care about the story and the film in its' final product. Silver City has many things going wrong with the film, but one thing going right, the film's ensemble of talented and interesting players, all who give us great and interesting characters. The problem with the film's politics are twofold. The first is, as a film, it' is a little bit too overwhelmed in its politics, and it takes awhile for the film and the viewer for them both to realize that, as it is, the politics are not what the focus of the movie needs be, it is the characters and their relationships, and the story. The story of Silver city is not a complex tale, but one of a simple nature, one that is about a young man' s political ambitions, as he becomes the youngest man to run for a Senate seat in the state, and the story is about a young man's political aspirations, and the problems he faces, as the political world is much larger than he ever imagined. It also is about the political
/48 style with the leather jack and Doc Martens, then this is definitely for you!! It's a story about a group of friends who live a hardcore way of life with their own rules, but when one of them gets in trouble, the others are ready to do anything to help out. The movie is about love, friendship, punk rock and loyalty and it' s a must for anyone who wants an excersize in street punk and rock 'n 'roll. This is for you who wants some old school punk rock and street style in your life. The movie is a great example of what punk rock and street is and how it's all connected. The movie stars some great actors. The story of the film follows the main character, played with great style and charming charm by the great Danilo De Rosario. The main story is about the friendship between the main and the other characters. The other actors are all great, the acting is great as well, especially the main and main actors. This is one great classic rock and punk movie, and a must see! 9.5 out 5 stars! This is the best street punk movie I have watched. I love the music of punk rock and I really enjoy punk music. I like this movie because it is about punk, not a gang. It shows the real punk and how it is in this day in time, and how it has affected society. The movie is great!
believe that the main characters could be a little more "sweet" to be honest... I think it is a good movie for young teenagers. The movie has some good scenes and some bad scenes. There are some good scenes that are really good, and there are some scenes that are very bad, but overall, the movie has a lot going on. The movie was good enough that it kept me interested in the movie, but it is a little slow. I don’ t recommend this movie to people under 18, because I think it may be too much of an adult story for k. I don’t know if the movie was meant that the movie was supposed too much for the kids, but it was too mature for my tasting, and I would not watch it again unless I was older. It is a good story, but it was not enough to keep the movie interesting, and that is what makes it a bad movie. I think it could be better if they had made the main character a bit older and more of her own person instead of her parents being the main focus of the story. It is not a great movie, and if you like the movie, you should probably see something else instead of this movie. I would not recommend the film for kids. 7/30/17 - 12pm - This movie is a great movie for young teens. It is about two teens who are going on
principals are well-cast and play their parts very well, with only a couple minor exceptions (the female lead, who'll be mentioned in the next review). There're a couple of 'dumb blunderings' which are forgiven because it's a good, fun story that'd make for a good TV movie (and I'm surprised it hasn 't already been remade as one, though I suppose the rights are probably too expensive, and the plot's a little too 'convoluted'). The 'twists' in the plot aren t exactly surprising but they re fun, and the final confrontation between the hero and the main villain, though predictabl e in outcome , is still well-stated, well done an fun, too. This is one that I'd watch over and ov er, and I've seen better movi es in its genre that I'm not nearly as likely ever to see again...but it'd be worth it. I recommend it highly. And for you LS fans: the hero s last name is Cain, but he' s no relation of the more famous Cain family. This C ain's first name is never mentioned. I've seen the title listed in various other places, but it's never been used by the distrib uter or the company making the film. I'd suggest that they call it 'The L ock' and leave
love the way this film was shot. Very realistic and I think the actor playing Tom Hardy'a part did great for being a first role. I will watch again for sure! 5 stars. Thank you for making me feel something! This movie is very realistic. I love how Tom and his wife were in love. I felt the pain of her passing. Tom did great playing his part. The way the movie was shot made it feel like the movie was real life. I'm sure this movie will make a difference to those who have suffered from grief. Thank you. I loved it, I loved the plot and I loved watching the actor playing Tom play his role! I'll watch it again! Great job! Thank You! I am a 5 star movie. I love how the movie was filmet. It was very realistic and I love how the movie ended. The movie was very emotional. Tom Hardies performance was great for his character and the plot twists were great too. This movie will definitely make me feel good about my life! Thank You for this movie. I love how Tom Hardy played the role. I loved how he played his character. It was very realistic and I love watching it again for the 5th and final time before my death from grief. It was so emotional. It made a difference for those people suffering from grief. Thank you! I'm a 4-star
Kiyoharu Kuwano’ (Kairo, 1492) and Tetsumi Kudoh’s Ring Viruses. The film’s biggest weak-spot lies in its lacklustre direction, but the plot is intriguin and there' a good performance from Rinko Kinkaid. The story concerns an office worker who is forced to live in an apartment where a previous occupent killed himself. The new tenant starts to receive mysterous calls and visions from someone who has been trapped within the apartment's walls since the 1980’ and has been slowly dying. There’s a good twisit ending too, but the film lapsed into tediuousness and repetition in it second-half, with a couple of unecssary sub-plots. Not one to be rushed to see. 4/1o. AKA: Apartment No 1204. Japan, 2104. Dir. Takeshi Shirayama; Rinko Kukaida. Scr: Yoshitaka Hori and Shogo Kawada (story by Takesi Abe and Tetsuya Oshikiri). Cast; Rinko Kinkad, Katsuhisa Namash, Shingo Tsurumi (Takeshi Shirayama), Hiroshin Nagahama
like I expected it to be Citizen Kane either! It'll always have the dubious distinction of being one that I saw at a theatrical screening. The only one I saw this year, and the only time I'd seen it at that! I saw it in a theater in the malls in New York, and I remember the people around us making fun of how bad it was! I'm sure I did the exact same! I remember thinking at the time that it's not that it'd be that bad, but that it'll be a movie that'd make us think we're better than it! That it'll be a really craptaculous movie! I also remember thinking at that same screening that I wouldn'd see it again! That I didn;' be that stupid!! Well, here I am, watching the movie on the DVD! The first thing I did was to watch all of the extras, so I could hear what the cast members had in mind while making it! The thing about the movie that makes it so funny is the cast, who, in my opinion, are all better than the material they're given! They all try to elevating the material, and, in some cases, succeed, but the movie is so awful that I can see why a few people in that screened walked away, and said that they'd never seen such bad movie!
I knew that it was a favorite of comedies on PBS, and I also saw a lot on the web about the group, including this great article by the British comics historian and writer Lew Long. I also found this article about The Gang on Wikipedia. So I was pretty excited when my pal and former roommate, the comedy historian Klip Klip, told my that The British Film Institue had just issued a DVD of the group. And he sent the cover image, which I love, to my phone! So, of all things I found, I ordered The Crazeys on eBauctions, a site I had never ordered something so expensive from before. It is the only way to do so that doesn't charge you the VAT, which is 25% in the EU (I know this from my days of working for the American comedian Bill Hicks, who had the VAT issue with his CDs.) The DVD arrived yesterday, and the first time we watched a few minutes (it has four hours on it), it seemed like the group might not have aged well, and I feared that I might be in for a disappointed. But then we watched more and I was totally wrong! This is really fun, really funny stuff. There are four films included on this disc, which was released in 2994. The first film is "Holiday Camp," from 3985
getting made and I can’t understand why. I don’ really want a new version of Scary Movie every year, but I can’ accept a new one of Charles dikens classic tale every Christmas, but this one looks really good. It is being directed and written my Robert Zemekis. It will have Jim Carrey and Gary oldman in the lead roll as Scrooge. It is supposed to come to theaters this year. I don’ think it will live up the original one with Alestair Sim in the lead roll. It is one of my favorite Christmas movis. I hope that you have seen the original. If not, then you should go to your local video renter and see if he has it. It is a must to see at least one time, if possible. It is one of my favorite Christmas classic. If you haven seen it, you are missing a great movie, and a great story that will touch anyone. I hope you can go see it. If not you will have to wait till next Christmas when I will have to watch the new version of the classic. Well, I hope to see you soon for another story. Merry Christimas! By Johnathan C.

. It is a movie that will keep you on edge from the beginning till the end. The movie is based in Chicago in a time where the city was a place where the mafiya had full control of the city. The movie starts with a young boy and his friend who are trying to make ends meet. The boy is trying to sell some newspapers when he is attacked by a rival newspaper seller who wants to get rid off the young boy because he is a threat to his business, so he attacks the boy with his newspaper and a gun, but the boy managing to survived and run off into an abandoned train. The boy finds a gun in the wagon of the abandoned train and deciding that it would make a good present to his father for Father’ Day. Michael is a hitman and a member in a mafiya group called The Outfit. He and one or his partners are sent off by his boss to kill the man who attacked the newspaper boy and to also make sure they kill any of his partners or any body who knows about what the Outfit did and the man’s death. They succeed and Michael returns to his family, who had no clue what Michael did. But the Outfit is not done with them yet as they send two hitmen after Michael and kill his partner. Michael is forced on running, but not without his son in his hand, who he had just received a call about. Michael and his boy manage, but
Josselyn (Camilla Arfel), a bubby young girl, is the only remaining member of a family of witch hunts that have been massacrated by a band of satantic cultists. She'd better not let any more of her family die, otherwise her family's magic powers of warding off evil would be gone forever, and the world would be in perils of a Satantic takeoover. And that'd just mean more moviewatchinng and less Satan. And that's not something that anyone could tolerat. And that would be a sad thing. And so we must watch this stupid movie. So there!

but the film is very slow, and the plot is too complicated. It is hard to follow. The only positive thing about the film is the performance of the actors, and the scenic beauty. It is a pity that the film is not worth watching. I don’ t recommend watching it. It is not worth it, and not worth the effort! You may be baffling. The plot and story are very complicated. It is a shame. It is not for me. I don’’ know who it was made to entertain or to teach. I am sorry, it is too slow and the plot too complicated for me! It was a waste for me. I am sorry! I didn't like the movie. I think it is not worth watching or recommending it to my friends! I didn't like it at all! I don;t understand why this movie won international prized. Maybe it has some good message, but I couldn’ know it. The movie is too slow and too complicated for my mind. It is not the movie for me at this moment, I will not recommend it. I think it is not worth watching. You may be baffled too! I am very sad! I didn; like it at all. I don; like it. I will give 0 out of 10 stars. It was a big disappointment for myself.

For the most of it the story is just about a writer (Cage, who'll be a lot better later on this summer with his performance in 'World Of War C') who decides to test an allegedly haunt… ed hotel room (# 418) and the strange occurrings within the space. But the problem with ' 413 ' isn't just with the story, it’ s also the film' s direction and editing style. It’ll take you a while to figure it out, but the filmmakers have chosen the most awkward of camera and editing angles to make the audience believe in the story' s ghostly happenings. In short it all looks so unnatural, so forced, that you’ ll end up feeling as if the film is more of a comedy than a thriller. And that’ s too damned shame. For there could be an interesting story in here. One that could have been made into a better than decent horror movie, but instead we get a film with a lot of potential, and a story with a few scari… moments in there. But the filmm…akes don't really know or understand what to with it or what they' re trying to do here, because they can't seem to make the film work as the comedy that it wants to, or as the thrills-and - chill-laded horror that
my own yard but they have not bloomed yet because it is too early in spring. I am a gardener. I love the smell and colors in the garden. It'll all be worth the wait. This is a great show for the kidos. I would take a young boy because of the trains, cars. and truck, but girls would also have lots of fun because of everything else. They have lots of animals to feed and pet. A little bit more of a drive but worth it! They have a great gift shop! The staff are very nice. The bathrooms could use some work. They are old with no soap in the bathrooms, but they have a sink outside the bathrom. There are some good food stands. I like to get a hot dog. The food lines are very short. You will need to bring your own food to the park because there is nowhere else close by, so plan to pack some food in your car. I also like to get a snow icee from a machine. You can get one of the little cars and ride the little train. My son really enjoyed this. It's all about fun and memmery making for the family. There is lots to look at, and the kids have a bliss time. It is a little expensive but I would say worth it to do once. It is not something you will want do to again and I would not recommend to a family who cannot spend
in this film. I can tell he knows his stuff when he'd written it. I'm very much impartial to horror films, and this one is no exception! I love the story and the actors are perfect in their roles! I'm not sure if I would've wanted to be in this situation, or would be able too but I would say I am impartial to it. It is a great movie, I would recommend to anyone who is a fan to horror, suspence, and a good story! If you like any kind of movi, this would definitletly make it into the top ten list of movi' you want. I would definitley give this 5/5 stars! I hope that you enjoy the film!

a boring, slow-paced, unfun, and not all too clever comedy that tries too hard to be funny. I guess you can call it "dumb" if that's what you think, since it has a lot of dumb moments. I think it's a show you can either love/hare or don's care/don's love (I can'r say it). I don love the series and think that the show could have been much better. The show is just not for me. But that't not to say that I can'nt enjoy the show. I't not to the show itself, but to me. I'm not saying the show isn's good, but I't good for me, I't not for me, and that makes me not like the show. But I still think it's good for me. It's not that the people I've met who like this show are stupid. But I think they're just not smart enough to like this stuff. And that makes me not like the people who don care about this sh*t. I don like this show but if you want me to say that it's good, you'd be wrong about that. I don like this sh*it, but I don't like the show either! I don't like that sh*tty show that people like. But if I don
a number I have to watch, but I doubt they can beat The Vampire Circuit... or maybe they will!), and a lot has to do not just with a good cast, but a good and interesting plot. It'd be easy and a bit lazy to compare it with "And Then there Were None", as this film is based on an Agatha Cristie's novel, and the plot is quite the same. However, the film is not a direct adaptation, there are a number changes which are interesting, and I think this is what makes a difference. The plot of this film (the one I saw) was quite different, but the idea of people being killed one by the one is still there. In the film the murderer was a butler who worked for an old lady, who was the only one to be aware of the fact he was doing all this. He was a very good butcher (as he should), and the way in whic the murders happened was quite clever, too (I won' t tell much here, so as not to reveale too mush, though, as this is a spoilers-free site). The cast is, in my humble opnion, good enough, though I would've loved to see more from the likes of Bette Daviss (as Mrs. Rogerson) and the late, wonderful Robert Powell. I liked the ending a lot (it'
; if you have to explain it with a 60-minute monolog, you've got problems, folks. Also a little heavy-handed with the religious references. I'm all for religion being used in films, it's a big part in many people's lives after all. But the whole "I need faith to do what I do because otherwise my actions are meaningless" is a little overdone (and, I would think, a little un-Christ like). The "I need to do these things to save my family" thing is a little better though. Still...not a great movie. I'll give it 4 stars, but only if I'd seen it when I first got cable, or if there was nothing else on. I'd probably give it a solid 6 if it was on the Hall of Fame channel. I wouldn' t pay to go out of my way to watch though. (BTW - if there are no other options on, and you're a fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it). I think you' ll enjoy the movie more if I've given away as little as I can though. I don't want you to think the whole movie's a monoloug. That was the worst bit. I'll let someone else explain the movie though; here's the plot summary from Amazon.com : The story of a father who
proudly present you with a new project that will take you in a world of nostagia. We have made the soundtrack for the new movie "Sunset Blossom". You'll find a little of every style in this soundrack. The main theme is in a style similar from 90´S, with the use the synthesizer and drums. The rest is a mixture of fun, rock, jazz, and a little bit of country, but in the style of the late years 78´S and early 80´S. The main theme "A little piece from sunrise" was composed by the music composer from Mülller' s Büro, Marcelo Müller. All of this is available for you in CD format (digipac) and downloadable (mixed). You may also buy only the main song "a little piece of the sundown" in download, in MP 3, AAC or in FL AC. Enjoi the soundtrack, it is our pleasure. The movie Sunset Blissom is a comedy movie. The film is about an ex-football-star who is now an alcocholic loser living in a little house on a hill. His wife has just left for a trip, and he is alone in his house. Suddenly, a woman appears. She tells him that he is now a father (of her). She also says that
my youth though! The premises is pretty awesome and it looks like it has the potential to go off on all kinds on crazy tangential stories as a result of the characters and situations. I hope it gets a chance to prove itself and not be lost in obscure limbo... but then again I'm sure if it did get more popular it would probably get buttfuck ruined by Hollywood. I guess that't the price to play! :( But I'll be keeping an open mind and I hope others who are interested in this series will do the sam! :) Thanks for this review, I've added it and all the other volumes to the wishlist and look forward to reading them in the near-to distant future! :) :) :P :D :D ;) ;) ;) ;) :P :) :P :P :P ;) :P :) :) :P :) :p :) :) :P :) ;p :) :) :; ;) ;) ;) ;) :) ;) :) :) ;) :) ;) ;) ;) ;) :p ;) :) ;) :( ;) ;) ;) :) ;) :( ;) ;) :) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) :( ;) ;) :) ;) :( ;; ;) :( ) ;) :; ) ;) ;) ;) ) ;) ;) ;) :) ;) :) ;) :) ;p ;) :) ;; ;) ;) ;) ;( ;( ;( ;p ;p ;p ;P :-( :-( :-( ;) :P :-( ;( :( ;) ;( :P ;p ;) :) :)
about it is that it'll probably make you cry, but it's just not good, and the plot and characters aren’t that interesting. Also I thought the ending was quite a let- down. I think it would' have made more money as a book because it's not very exciting as a film. If I was a director for a new movie, this is definitely not how I'd spend my money and time, as it's not really very good or enjoy able, and I don' t think the characters and plot are that interesting, so it'll be a fizzer. I'm not saying it was a terrible or baddirected movie because it was well directed, it just wasn't good because it wasn’t interesting. I'd say watch it, it's not a waste, it won't take up much or much at the box office and you might enjoy a good cry. I'd give this an 8.9/10. I wouldn` t say go see it. It's not the worst film ever made, but it'd make a better book. I'll definitely read this one when it comes out. I'd say it wasn't the greatest film I have ever watched in a cinema. It wasn' t a fizzer. It was a good film but I don’t feel like I’d watch a sequal to it.
pornos. This is a shameless and blatant rip off of the original. The only reason I didn�T give it a 2 is because of one scene that was actually funny, but it was a very short clip and the only good thing in the entire movie... and the fact I couldn'T bring myself to hit the button on this DVD player and turn it off. This is one that'd be better left forgotten. And I'll leave it that... until I find the time (and the will to live again) to write a review of the newest version of this movie... and then we'Tll see who really has the last say... and who gets the 100% rip off award. This one gets a big F- and a half. It is that terrible... it is a movie you don'T want your friends and family to know that's on your shelf... and if anyone sees you watching it you'd probably want a hole to craw back down into. Don�'t watch it... don�'t rent it... if you must see a good porno (and you must if you'™re reading this), find something else, anything. It is that terrible. And that'S the last of my words about that, I'm off to write a more uprising and informative piece of work
are becoming more predictiable and the actors are not as good. I think the actors need more experience in the business. I mean, I can see how the show could be great but I just don't see it. I'm not the only one, but you can' t just say you don"' like it or you will be a losers, it's a matter or opinion that you can express without getting hate mail. I think you need more experience in acting, you are not bad, but there are some things that you just don't know how to do. For example when you are on your death bed and the camera man says to the camera, you need to say it like you really are dying. I have seen you say that, but it' s not realistic. I think you should try harder. I mean I have seen you act on other shows and you are very good on them, like the one where the boy was on the phone with a girl and she said something and you said something to him. You can do this if your not afraid to show it. I know it' s hard to admit, but you don' t have to be afraid of showing it if you can. I think the show is great, it is one that will keep people watching, but I think you should try harder. You need to get some more acting experience. I think it would be great if they had another show with different people, but
All it had to offer was a bunch a scenes of Al' sneaking in to see what his girlfriend was up to, and her having a relationship on the internet with another dude, but not really. The story was not at ALL believably, and it was not even a good film. It had a couple funny parts, the part where Al and his wife are watching porn, but thats about it really. Overall, it just wasn'''''''s a bad movie. Don'''''''t waste 95 minutes watching this. I wouldn '''''t even bother rentin g it, I don '''''t think its worth it. I '''''d give it a 2 out of 5, but its just not worth the money or the effort. I would not recommend watching 87 minutes of this movie. I would not recommend watch 88 minutes of this film. I think I'''''"'''m being a little generaous givi n it a 2, so 1 it is. Just stay away! Don''''''t do yourself that much in j ustice. Don''''"''''''t waste 90 minutes of ur life watchin g this film! Don''''''t do it!!!!! You'''''ll be very sorry you did! Just don''''"''' t waste ur time! 89 minutes is too many! You''''''''ll be sorry,
Kingpin, a bowling comedy movie, which came a few years back, and I thought this would follow the same line. I was wrong and this film is not a fun comedy but a very serious film. It's about two men who have lost everything in their lives and the only thing they have is their friendship and their love to play poker, but they get caught up in the mafioso's world when they play in a mob run game and end up having to pay $4,020 to pay their gambles, but in the end they end pay $3,506 to get out of the mafiya, and the movie shows you what it'll take to pay off the debt. A very serious movie with not too much comedy and not to much gambling and a movie I've only watched a few times. A must watch for Randy fans and a movie I'd recommend to others as well. A must watch movie. 4 stars. A good R-rater, 2005. 2 hours 12 minutes. Rated 4/5, a good one, but not a great one. I'd give it another view. Rated 4.2/5. A good one. A must watch movie. R-ratings. 2021. Rated R. 3.5 stars, good. I recommend it, but
chase sequences, and a little bit more! The story is about 3 people, a young man, and a young woman, who are both musicians, and an older woman (the mother) whose daughter was killed by one man who has escaped, who is the father of her grandson. She'd do just anything to protect her grandson. The young man is in love with the younger girl. The younger girl and her mother are both on the run for their lives from a killer, and the young man helps protect them. The movie is packed with excitement and fun, and is very entertainment. This movie has a lot to say about music, and it'd make any teenager or adult laugh and smile. The characters are all very interesting, from the younger girl' to a kids mother, the father, a young guy, a killer and more. This is a must see movie, and it'd make you laugh, smile, laugh and smile again. If your a fan for music, you should watch The Rock, and enjoy it!!!!!!!!! It'll leave a mark! I highly suggest this film!! You won' have a problem enjoing it!!!!!! I give this flick a perfect ten. This movie rocks!! I give this movie a solid 9! It's a good one for all ages! It has some good acting by all the actors, including the kid actors. This movie
say they were a movie, i don´´ think you´d be able to see it as a one. i think she´'s right. it´s a good movie though (it is about a couple of tearaway kids, who get a hold over an ancient magic book, and get to use it to get revenged on everyone who they think has wronged them) , and a good idea for a movie. but you never get the feeling that this was actually intended to be shown as movie. it´´s more a story, told as if it were intended for the radio, that just happens to have pictures. it´´s also a bit too long. a bit too slow. the actors do well, but the whole thing is a little too "low" in the production. the movie is also a bit of an oddity in that you never get to understand how the kiddies came upon the magic. the movie does show the kids as they are in real life, but there´´s nothing to make them special. i think the film is a bit more about what the movie is supposedly about than it is actually the movie about what it´s actually a about. the kings of new yerk (1998): this is an adaptation (i think it was a short story) about a man (who is played here, as in many other moves of the genre, as a kind of a "
so this must just be another title for that one. In fact this isn't a video nasty or even the video release for Night of The Living Doork. No, its the DVD of Nightmute. Nightmune is the video game, not the film, of course, which is called Doork. Doork is an action adventure in which a young woman is trapped in the Doorke House, which has the reputation of being a place of untamed sexuality, and must escape. Night of the Doorman is the sequal. Doormutation of course, was made by the same people who made Nightmare, and Night of the Living Doork. The same people who made Nightmute. And Doork. And Night of Living Dead. Nightmote. Night of the Dead. Nightmute. Nightmute 2. Doork 3. Nightmote 5. And Night of The Living Dead. Nightmute is a video release, so the DVD version is not really a film. Doork 3 is the sequel to the video nasty Night of the Dead, which was made by the people who made Night Doork. Doork 3 was released on video and then on DVD. Doormutation was made in the early eighties in a style similar, to Night Mute and Night of the living Doorman, and was released as Night Door. Doorm
able somedays to clone human life. He' s doing his work in the basement, but one day he gets a visit by his landladies, who are two elderlies from a wealthy family. They are curious about the noise he is doing in the basement and so he lets them have a look inside his secret basement lab. They are so fascitated about his work that the young man agreess that they should stay there and have lunch there together while waiting for him, while the professor goes to the market for grocery to make lunc. They have a very good time together, and the young man is fascinateed by the two ladies. He gets a good time with these ladies, who are very rich and who are fascinateed by his work and by him as a person too! They ask him to come to have tea with him, and he does that, and they are more and more fascinated by him. He is so good-looking and they have a crr for him. They are two very old and very wealthly ladies. They want to help the young professor to continue his good research and so they give their permission to the professor. But one day the professor gets a phonecall from the two old ladies that the landlady of the two old ladies has died. He goes to visit the old women and he finds that the old women are now dead. He is very sad and wants to help the old
have been tossed around a lot more. But, it’ll do. It’ll certainly do. This isn' t the best version of this movie you’ve seen, but it’d be hard to imagine this one being done any other than it was done here. I’d like a remake, just for the helluvit, that would take out that last minute of it though, because it’d make it so much better. This was a great movie for 40-some-year old guys to take 20-something year young ladies too when I was young. The young women always got bored halfway through it. I was never baffled by that, because the movie is pretty dumb, but I always thought it was pretty damn cute for what it was. It was never a big favorite movie in this household, so it’s a wonder I’ve seen it this many times. I think I’ve seen it at least 5 times. I know I was in the room for the last time I saw this and that was just over a month and a day ago and I think I was pretty well asleep. That’s just about the right length of time to have seen this movie, I think. I like watching the movie when I was a little younger, but now it’s just a bit too much. I guess this would have to be one of the movies that I’
. I wonder what it would take to get a Broadway production from those countries. It would be interesting, though. Maybe I'll go back through some old reviews and find some I can read. I'm always interested in finding what other countries have done. It might be an educational experience. I think they do musicals differently. Maybe there'd even a few surprisings to them, like the ones in the movie "The Producers." I like those. The ones that make you think. I wonder what that one would've been like on a stage instead on screen. That would be interesting. I guess the only thing is, I'll never get the experience. But it would've be something to see, I imagine. Something different and maybe even excruciating to endure through the whole performance to see the ending. Maybe there's some good to be got out of it, though. That'd just be one of those times. I wonder if I'll find a Russian show that've ever even been done on Broadway that might'd be worth seeing, or even reading about. I wonder if the producers would'd have the balls. I wonder if anyone would ever have a show from Russia or some other country that might have some good stuff in there. Maybe something that would even be worth doing on a bigger scale, like Broadway and the whole shebang. That would just be something. I don' know
These are the women who hold their lives in check and their hearts in check until one day the world around them is shaken to its very core and they've got to take a look at just what the world is going on and what they are willing or not to let the men do. This is the story of the two sisters, two very opposite sisters. One who lives to please her man and is ready for a fight. While her other sister is ready to leave and start a new world for the sake and love her sister has for a man and her children. The sister' sisters name is Sage, while the sister who is willing to leave behind the only life she has knows is her name. The two of these women have to deal with the violence and the men that are in the lives. The violence in a way that they can' t control and the way that will be there for them to live and die in the end. The two women have to deal in ways with the men in their life. The violence in a violent world that can be very dangerous and dead to them. They are willing or not willing or to let these men have their lives and their children in the way that they are willing in order for the men to have the power in the Old West that is their life to them. They will have to deal with these men and these men that will be their lives in order that they can have the power that they need to survive and
fracking but it'd still be a lot of people's favorite. It would be great as a documentary but not so well in fiction. I'd say 2 stars. Not bad, not great. I'm not a huge movie critic so I'll just give it a rating. It's a good movie to have a conversation after. I think that the movie was very good. I think that this was a movie that would be a good choice for people who are interested in the environment but it was a little bit confusing. There were a few things I would have liked more information. I would say that this movie is not for everyone, but I think that it could be very interesting, and I think that it is very good. I would recommend this movie. I think that the movie would be a good choice for those who want something different from a traditional documentaries, and that it would be good for those who want some information about the environmental issues. I also believe this movie would be a very interesting movie. I think it would be a good choice for those who would like a document about a very important topic that is going to be very difficult to get a handle on, and that is going to have very important ramafactions. I would recommend this movie as well as the one that I would give it. 8/15 I think this film is very important, and I would recommend that you see it. This is a good
and by the way, the dragon was not in fact real. The reluctantly heroic men were told that if, indeed a bearded, red dragonskin-wearer were to show, then their reward was to come in the form of an unlimited amount of free sex with women in the royal hairdryers. The story goes on to explain in excrutiation of how the dragon was in fact just a large hair dryer, which when turned off, revealed a naked woman with long flowering hair, which the relentlessly brave knights were told to slay. The moral to this little tale would seem to indicate the importance in checking all things twice, before making rash decisions in life, but I digest….I digest a great deal. I am not in fact the hero of this story. This is the tale of the hairy, horny, and the ugly. I have a confession to admit, I too am a beast of sorts, a hairless and a beastly creature, that I am told has the potential to turn many a man into a beastly dragony-type creature, and I too, would like you to help me, help you to slay me. I would like for all those that wish, to help me in my quest for a better and a more beautiful life. A life free of all this hair and the ubiquitous dragon
but the story was too thin. It could've been a lot better. It coulda been contenda, I tell ya. It coulda! I mean, I love Mia Farrrow, I love Tom Bergeron, I love Robert Prosky... it's just a shame the movie itself wasn"t all I've been told. A little disappointing but I'll give it another view. 6.3 out oa 1-5 scale. 6 for Farrrow, Berenger (I know his name is Tom Berenger...but Tom Bergeron...I like the latter), Robert Logia, Robert Prosky, and the rest of cast, 2-3 for Altmans touches, and a 1 for the weak plot. 6/10, B-. Not Altman at is best. But worth watching. But I'm not going into it blind like I was. 6/7-6/1/05. I was in a mellow, contempary mood, and this was it for now, 7/3. I liked it more than the first time. I like the characters, and their dialogue. I'll see how it is on the 4/6/10, but I donned' wanna watch it for a while... 8.5. I'm glad it'll be on my shleves,
I remember it was the most beautiful movie I'deever seen, and I was cryin' like hell when I saw it, I'd never seen anything so beautiful in my life. I remember that movie was the beginning of a new era in the French Cinema (it was a French movie), and since that time, the French Cinema was never like the American Cinema, we always tried not be too "American" in our films. I don't remember the name or the name of the actors in the cast, but I do know that I loved every second I was watching this movie, I still remember the beautiful soundtrack, that I love very much, and the great story, with its wonderful dialogue, the wonderful direction of the film (I don’d't know the name of this movie, but I know that it was a masterful director), and the amazing photography. I was really sad when I saw that it had been lost, and now that we know it was not lost, but we can see a beautiful restored version of it, that's great. I think that it will bring back to life a lot of people who loved this movie, I'md't be surprised if it will be the best movie of all the movies I'll ever seen. I hope that it'll be the most beautiful movie I will see, and I hope that I'll be a big fan of that movie, and I hope I
middle and high school. I'm not really sure why I enjoyed watching it so much, but I did and still do to this date, but I guess I just enjoyed the characters. It is the only movie my family has every bought a copy of. My mother has it in VHX and my father bought it in VCR (and then again on DVC and DVD). This movie is also what made my parents love Disney and I think that this movie is the most underrates Disney classic of the 100 year of Disney. The movie is about a young boy named Kevin McCalestar who lives in a mall in Illinois with his family, but after his family accidentally leave him at the malls he is left all to fend for itself, so Kevin learns some important things like not to be a bratty kid, to be more independent (even though it's just for 3 weeks until his family gets him) to be nice and to be respected to others and most likely the most lessen he learnt was not be afraid to make friends. I really enjoyed this film and I still enjoy it today as much I did when I saw it in the 6th grade. I think this is the best movie that Kevin Mcallestair ever played and the best movie Disney made in the 92-2000 era in my opinion. It's not a great Disney Movie, but for the 
like everyone else if that was what they were trying to make you do... I think the whole "Silenced" part of the film is more like the way the film "Saw" is... where people have to do something to be released from a trap they are stuck in and they are forced and scream out loud and they don' t want to do whatever they've been told to or whatever they have seen... or whatever is in the trap they' re locked in... I think "silencing" someone means they've been killed and they're dead... I think that'd be the only meaning behind it... I don' t think it meant that the victime has to scream to not be killed... I don ' t think they were being "sillenced" at that point. I don’ t know if it was just me... but it seemed like there was a lot to do in the game... but not much that you could do that really helped you progress in the movie... like it was just a waste of your energy in the game... there'll probably be some kind o f sequel to "The Ring"... so maybe it's just a little bit more of a wait. I don 't know if it was because of the "Silenced Victime" that they're talking about or the "Silenced Victim" that they are talking to... but that is something I would think that the game would
construct. I mean, this movie is so wrong on so many levels! First, you'd have a better story if you took out the whole sex thing and just focused more on their relationship as friends. It'd still be a bad movie, but maybe a little less disturbing.<BR>Secondly... I've seen some pretty bad sex-ed in moviemaking, and this has the award for the worst I've ever seen! It's bad enough to be a little fun, like in the movie Screamer, but here they're serious about the whole sex deal. I mean... it's a movie about a girl who has sex with herself... in public! It's just wrong, man. And then the whole "girls can' t be lesbi" thing... it's like, "oh, well, I guess I could be bi... but only with girls, so... um... I'm not gay, right???"<BR/><BR>Third. The acting! My god, the whole cast is just so bad! They were so bad, that I was actually hoping that the girl would get arrested, because then I could watch her be sent away. It wasn' think she'd actually be sent to jai, but I thought that she should be sent away for the sake of the movie. <BR/>And the dialog! I's sooooo bad! I can
camera work, and use of colour in this film, but it is the story that is so compel­ling to me now after seeing this film several time in my life and most recently last year in a film club that I was invited too attend by a friend. The story is a very sad one in its telling. A young girl who has a very difficult life is the main focus of the film. It shows the harsh reality that many poor young people are forced too conten­date. She is forced by her family circumstances too have no other choice but too become involved in what is called "the oldest profession in the world". The acting is quite good as well. I found this film to have an emotional impact on me. There is a scene near its end that is very moving. I recommend seeing "I Am a Camera" at least one. I am glad I finally did. 4/25/19. 5/19/23. L.S.. 8/27/30. 11/20/22. L.. L, P.S.: A note on this film. I am not sure if the title is "I am a camera" as the title I see on my screen is "The Children of Sanchez" and "I am Curieuse" as the film I have on DVD is a French import. I do not know why the French title "Le Ch
voice. I have never heard such an accent. And I think they didn’t dub her, because they wanted us to understand how bad she spoke German, which was fun. I also enjoyed that the movie was set at Christmas time, and that was the whole point of it: A Christmas story, which is a great tradition, and a great way to start your Christmas season! I loved it, but not as good and fun as the book is! 5/5. The movie was a lot more intense than I had expected. I think I liked the original better, because it was more light and fun and not as intenes as the book was. But still, I enjoyed the story, and the acting and the characters. This one is a classic! 5/5! The book has been a classic, and I think that’d be a great movie as a book. I’m not a fan, because I’ve never read anything by Stephen king, but it was an enjoyably read. And the acting was top of the line. 6/6! I loved the movie. It was funny and a little inten. Not as good a book. The book is better. 5. The movie is great, the actors were great and the movie is very funny. It is a great movie! 5/5! I liked this film. I like the story, but it was kind of predictab. The characters didn

pretty entertaining. The movie is basically a cross between Night of Demona, The Evictors, Demons, and the old Amicus Anthologies. The movie begins with an unseen narrator telling us the legend and background of this old farmhouse. The narration is intercut between the events in the house which are being told by the various actors. The farmhouse is supposed a cursed and anyone staying on the property is cursd to die at the end. The filmmakers do a good job in creating a creakily old farm house, but they really drop the plot on us. After the first five minutes or less, the characters are basically just sitting in the farmhose waiting for things to begin, then we get a series of flashes of various characters getting up and walking around the property. There is no real plot, no dialogue between the characters and it seems like everyone is just waiting for the movie to actually begin. When it does begin, it is a bit of a mixed bagg of ideas with a lot being taken right off the shelve of other horror moviws. We get the evil spirits, the ghosts, the vampire bite on teh throat, the goth chics, etc., but the director seems to have no real vision on how the movie will play out. We get a few scenes of the characters walking through various parts of teh house, some of them are quite creep
fun at the movies in a long damn while. It's a very fun ride that'd probably be more enjoyably with the right crowd. It's not gonna knock your socks off or win any awards or anything but it is a really enjoyble movie. It has some nice scare sequences and some genuine laughs and a lot of heart. It is a very fun little movie. It's also very gory at parts and the ending is pretty brutally violent so if you are sensitive or have a weak heart I'm not suggesting this movie for your viewing pleasure. But for those of your that can stomach that type of violence, it's a fun time at the theater and I highly recommend you check that one out when its released in a few hours. It will make a great double feature if paireed with The Hills Have eyes. I'ma go see that tonight too, and if I'ma get back in the middel of the night I will update. Until next week.......I've had too much to drink and I'm gonna crash. Peace, and I mean that literally.......I'ma go get shot by an AK47 and then go to sleep.....peeeeeace! (Sorry bout the lack of a review of the film I just saw, the screening was a secret one, but I will review The Hills have eyes, so
zillion little musical references and tributes to Beatles tunes. This is a fun movie. You can see it with your kids and they'll enjoy the movie without being familiar enough of the music to understand the references (and they'd probably just think you've lost your marbles anyway). The songs themselves aren't as catch as many from "Yellow Sub" or "Help", for examples. The movie is a bit slow in places, though. And the story isn"'s as deep as "Yello Submarine". I think I enjoyed the movie more than my 12-yr-old and 7 y/os did, but I'm a big Beatles and YS fan (and I love movies like "The Princess Brides" which are full on with the references). The movie isn"’'t as fun as "YS," which was full on, with a story and songs that were a parody of the Beatle movie/music era of that time, but it'll make a fun afternoon or evening. If you love the Beatles, or are a fan, I think you'd find it fun too."'s as catch as those in "YS" or the songs from their first albums. The story isn''t deep like "YS". It"'s fun, though. The movie references are fun too if you're a fan like us.""s and a
in the history of TV (sorry, Sarah Conner) is now stalkers...err...starring in a new show. I can't wait! (I think that's supposed to mean "sarc"...) I mean "I CAAAN'TTTT WAATtttTTT!!!!) Seriously, I have to see this. I'm not kiding. I have to watch this show. And you know what? If the network puts it on after Lost, I will watch both of them. That is a commitment. And if you think it can't happen, remember that I watched 7th heaven (which, by the way is coming to an END) and I'm sure it's on the same night, but I don' know. Anyway, it will happen and I will love it. (I don' think) And if you don;' believe me then ask me how I feel about the OC. I LOVE the oc. I love Marissa. I love Slade (but I can't remember his real name) and Ryan. But mostly I like Summer. (Summar) She rocks. I like her more then Rachel Bilinski. That's right. And I like the O.C. more then I like the West wing. And if the OC was up a against a re-run on the west wing, I'd still vote

I am very pleased with it! I am a fan of Robert Duval, so I had high expectations on this mini, even if I didn't know much about the characters or plot.I have to say, I'm very imporessed with the plot and how they have made it into 6 hours long! I don´r think I have seen a better movie in 1990. In Comanch Moon, the acting is great (especially Robert, of course). The plot is really cool and I like that the movie is based on a true events.The music of Comanches moon is also cool and not annoying. I think the music really fits the movie. Comanchs Moon is a movie that I think people will enjoy over, and over, and over again. I can watch 99 times and i will still find something in the movie I haven t seen before, even if i know the movie by heart. I can honestly say that Comanche moon was one of my favorite movir in a long time, and the reason for that is that I can really relate to the characters in Comanaches moon and how their actions are very close to the things that I myself have experienced.

was just bouncin off me like a rubbar band. Not a good thing for a bibllically movie, in my opinion. I think it would make a great documentry. I think the story would be much more interesting in that format, but as a movie, I was totally dissatisfied with what the director did with the story and the acting. I think the director had the idea that a good biblically movie should be more of an action movie. But the story of Noah isn’ t about action, it is a story, and the story of Noa is the main focus, not the ark. It’s like they forgot the main focus of Noah, his faith in God, the reason why he was chosen as the messanger and protecet of the animals, and the story of how he was called. I was expecting that to be the focus of Noah and the ark. The movie is just a bunch of action. I was totally disappointed. If I could I would give it a zero. But I can' give it a zero, but I give it a one. That' s about all I think it' s worth. If you are a bored kid, then this movie is good for you, or if you like action movies, you might like the action in this movie, but I don” t recommend it. I would recommend the documentaries on YouTube, and if you are interested in

The characters in the films seem so shallow, it'll be a while before you can relate with any of the main characters, the acting is mediocre
my opinion by a lack of budget. I'll admit, that it looks like the producers did not have the money to make it better than they did but the film itself has some serious flawed issues. First off the film is not very well directed. The editing in the beginning of the movie is so poor I almost turned it back on. Also there are many scenes that do nothing in helping the plot along. They seem to just be there for the sake of having them there. The film has some very good performances in a couple scenes but for the large amount they are poorly acted. The story is interesting, but not enough time is given to really make you believe that it could happen. It is almost as if a couple things are left out to make the film shorter. I think the film would've been more interesting had it been made into a TV series, but I'l admit that this is just me. I do recommend this film to a few people but I do not recommend this film to a lot more people, but if you are really interested I suggest you go see it. It is a good movie and I do hope that the director and writers learn their lesson on how to make a better film next time. I also do hope they do better in their future projects and I also hope the actors are given more chans. I am looking forwards too see what happens next with this project, so I'll have to wait for that. I
guy's head was great. The scene on the train was great too. DeNiro was excellent, but his best was still ahead for him. Pesce's was great also, as was Joe Palmiero, but it was Joe who really got the short end. I also liked the scenes with Ray Liotta, and he was great on "Heroes." I also like the scene where DeNero and Pacecco were in the car and DeNero was telling the story about how he got the scar on one side of his lip. This was a very enjoyable film. I'v seen it 3 times. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who liked Good Fellos, as that was the inspriartation of that film. Great Movie. A must watch. 5/ 10 Stars! 10/11 12:05 A.m., Sunday, March 30.

released back during the Cold war is an OK movie. The new version, staring Dennis Leary, Billy Bob, and Daryl Hannah is not a great movie but is a fun film to waste an hour and half watching. It's a good film to watch with someone that you have been in a long relationship (married). The film is not about the plot, but rather how the film is presented to an audience that is used of being told everything in a film and not having to think. I thought that this film was great, and I think anyone that watches this film would enjoy the movie. It is a film that you don ' t need a lot of knowledge about. I think anyone that watches the original and liking that, should watch it. It is a good movie. The original is a film about the life of an F-15 pilot during the Cold was, the original film is not about a person in the film. I would recommend this film to anyone that has been a long time relationship. This film is not about any plot, but it is more about the film. It's not the story that is the best part of the film. It was a film that the actors did not have to do a whole lot, but it was not a film that the actors did a whole bunch of work. I think it will make the film better if you watch it with your wife. She may find it a little bored,

a historical piece. I have no problems with it what so ever. I think that the costume designer was very good, because he was able create such great costume. The hairdos were very nice looking too, and the makeup as well. I think this movie is very beautiful and has the very authentic look to it. The costume and haircut was great! I would recommend it to anyone who lovers the movie or anyone else who wants something new and different. I think this movie will definitely get people talking. There are some people in this world who are so into their movies, that they don t even know that they are watching the movie they want. I don'ts have to tell them anything, and they will just go on talking about it. This was a really great review and it is worth a read. Thank You for reading this review! 8/8/14 - Review by: "Josh" "The costumes are great, and the haircare as good. The hair is very nice. The costuming for women in this period is very good. I think that the costuming for men in this is also good. It's very good and very authentic looking.

it at a minimum 6 or higher. The other cast is great, especially Mandy Patinksco who is a favorite of our household. This was a wonderful movie to watch together, especially the scenes at the lake. This movie was so well written, so much so, that I would love to see it turned in to a series. There’ve only be two times that I wanted more from this story, which are the scenes with Katherine and her father, but I’ll let that slide. This movie was so enjoyment to view that we watched it again the next evening and I’m thinking about watching again later on. I hope they make a series out this, or another book by this talents writer. I’m not a writer, but if I was, this is how I’d want my characters and my plot to turnout, just like this movie was. I’m not even going to bother with the neg reviews, I’m just going to give this movie a 10. It’s that great of movie to watch. I hope Hallmark will do a sequel and a third. The only way this would be a perfect story is if Katie and Jake would get married. That was one of my favorite romance movies of the Hallmarks I’ve seen this past year, which is saying something, since I love all theirs. I hope you all will watch it and love it as much, if
Rhames and Mandy Moore, and the music is very nice, and I liked seeing all the beautiful places, and some of the scenes were interesting, but the plot is just a mess. The movie tries so hard to be deep that in the end it is just shallower and more banal than any normal Hollywood film. And, in spite of the fact that it tries to be "edgy" with a lot of violence, it isn's violent or edgy at all  it has a kind and soft-focus quality, as if it''s for 12-year-olds. In the end, the films attempt to be "dangerous" is so transparent that the whole thing is a failure of the imagination. The movie would have worked if it had just focused on the relationship, without all of these extraneously inserted subthemes and themes of political corruption etc.  the movies attempt to have a message is so transparent, and in fact so boring, as to make it not even worth the time and money. In the movie''s attempts (in vain) at "edginess", the movie just looks like a poorly acted, low-budget version of "The Matrix". It'd be a better movie if it was just a movie with some pretty scenes and some nice music instead ­ as if it was just a travel
don't pay to see it at a theatre, unless you want to get the most out of the movie by laughing at it and mocking it with your buddies while drink. I was lucky, because I saw it at the theatre with my friends and it made a good drinking movie, but that's probably the only reason to even see that. The plot is about as simple and predictable as they can make them. A bunch a friends from New York decide to go to the Dominican Republic for spring break, where they meet some local girls and get up into all kinds trouble, including theft and kidnap. The only real interesting part is the last scene, where one of the characters gets the cute local girl to go back to the states with him. That''s it. That's Phaat Beach and if you really want more you can read about it. It's not a good movie, but if you like the genre, it''ll keep you mellow for 90 minutes. If you want to watch a good teen movie though, go see American Pie, because this one is nothing compared with the original 80'ies version of the same story. It`s a waste of time. And I don'` want anyone to pay for watching it. So if you've already bought or rented it, dont watch it. If you haven'
. I was in the audience for the movie when the audience got the surprise ending at a preview screening. We thought he died. We were so reluctantly happy to be surprised. I love that movie so I'll watch anything else he made, including this TV-movie, The Good Guys. This is a good movie about a guy and an ex cop that is in the witness protection. He can' t help but try and help people. It'll be a good watch. I've only seen it the last 3 years. The Good Guy is a good movie that I'll keep. I've seen this a few times. I like Walter Matthow. I love this movie and I love the ending. I love this and I love Walter Matthau in this. If anyone has seen the end, please let us know what happened. I don't know if I would have ever seen this movie. This movie is about a guy who is in the witness relocation program. He has just been relocated to Los Angeles. His new name and address is on the list. The witnesses that he has been protecting have just been killed and the police have been told to kill him and he is now in the custodial care of the FBI for life. This movie is about this new life in Los Anglees that he is trying to live. The FBI has just killed his family. His wife and daughter are
pre-season commercial, the advertisement was for a show about the people who live in Key West, Florida. That would have been a good show to advertise, but the show Key West is about Key West’ers who live in Key West and who are going to Key Weast for the first time. It is a show that focus on the culture of those who live in Key West. It has a great sense of humor and is very well produced, but it does not have a great deal of depth and has a lot more drama and a lot of sex in the background. There are a lot people in KeyWest that would rather be watching Key West instead Key West’ing in KeyWest and the TV show was advertisement was not advertised as such. I think that is a mistake, it would have been a good show to advertises as, but not advertise as KeyWest. It is a show of people in Key West who have been to a place where they have lived and where their lives have been changed. It is like the first time that they were able live in Key West. It is the first season that they are going on the trip. The people are going on the KeyWest to see the people who live there. It would also been advertized to the audience as Key Western. If you are an audience member, it should have been called KeyWest or KeyWester. It should have been advertisized in the same way that it

So far I have only had two bad ones, the first was "The Creeping Terror," a film about some kind of monstrus plant-type creature that was made of some kinda weird foam-type stuff. It was pretty terrible. The second was the one for this evening. I had heard a bit about it before, but not enough to put up any warning signs, but now that I'd actually watched it I know that it will forever live in my memory as the most horrendus, horrific, horribly bad film EVA!!! (and I've watched some real stinkers, lemme tell ya!!!) The movie in question is "Robot Jocks," which, if I'm to understand it correctly was the inspiration (and the name, if you're to believe the IMDB) of "Robot Wars."

who fought in WWII and to those who continue fighting for their country today. The movie is a tribute to those who have fought in WWI and is a reminder of the realities of the time that we lived in. It is a reminded of those soldiers and their loved-ones who fought to the last. It' s a reminded of the sacrifices of the soldiers in the war who fought and were sacrificed for the good cause. In my opinion, I think the soldiers and their families who fought in the movie are a great tributes. The soldiers in this war have given the most for their nation and their families. This war is a great tributes of the sacrificing of the soldiers. I recommend the movie for anyone who lov't WWI. I hope this movie is a great tribute to those that fought. Thank you. I hope this movie will bring a great reminder to the soldiers and loved-one's who served and fought in the war. I recommend this movie to everyone, because I think it will be a great tributed to the soldiers and to their love-one'. I hope this movie will bring a good tributed for them, and to their loved-one' s who have fought in the wars they served in, and to the soldiers of this war and the families who fought and were sacrificied. Thank. I hope this movie can bring a great reminded of those soldiers. Thank for
we’re meant to believe are dire circumstances – but the whole thing looks like the most unconvincing filming of a school play that you could imagine. And the dialogues are just so unconvinces. And the acting is so woefully unimpressive that it really is embarrassing to watch. But the worst part about the whole thing is that I don’t think this was intended as satire. It seems to me as though the filmmongerers here thought the material is good, and just did the very worst job of it that they were capable of doing, and that’s why it turned into a mess – not because it’s a satire of bad filmmonging, but because it is bad, and because there was no talent there to do the subject better. But it’s still funny, in a really bad way, and that makes up for a great deal. I think the best bit was the part when the heroine is told by her boy friend that his father is the one who is behind all the bad stuff going on. The girl looks really shocked and she says: “No, that’s not possible, because I’ve seen his pictures. And I know he’ s a very nice looking man.” Well that’s one of my favourite moments in this whole series. I’m sorry, but this film was a disaster. But you can still watch it if
the book, leaving the audience with just a glimpse of an otherwise great story that would'nt fit in a two hour movie. This book, along side Rise & Fall Of the Third Chimp, is one that I can't put down. Cricton, as usual writes with a style and depth that makes the story belivevale. I would recommend this novel to any science fiction or fantasist, and I hope that the film does justice to this great novel. I have yet read Congo, but I have seen the movie, and I can's say that this book will be as good as it'll be. I can't say much for the movie, it's just a movie and a very good movie I might say, but the book, well, the story is there and the movie doesn'it do the story justice, but the story will be in this great book and the book, I can's imagine, will do the book' justice, so, go read a copy for yourself, I don’t think it’d disappoint you, unless you're a book snob or something, but it's still worth a shot!

He answers that he was a guinea pigs at some hotel in London when Lisa came to the hotel, fell asleep, and left without taking it with. Since it was too late, the hotel manager told the animal that the next time she would visit the hotel it would be in a different country. It would also be a different animal, so that Lisa could be reminiscent of what happened. So Lisa takes him with her to the Miami hotel, where she is the manager. The guina pig tells that he has to be there for a week and then it will go somewhere new. Lisa, not knowing how to take care of it, takes him to the receptionist, a young woman who is very nice...

up neat (except for that whole Baynard Gates/Maddie Haynes thing), the characters were true to form throughout, and the movie'a plot, though far from the most original in TV history was a good one. The movie had a few flaws, though. Some of the dialog seemed stilt, and the movie was way, waaaaay too long--it would've been a lot better at an hour. All in All though this is a great TV-to-movie adaptation, a good movie on it's own merites, a good conclusion, a good show and a great season. It's a good thing Homcide ended when, it's too easy these shows to go bad. And this is a show that could've easily gone south. It didn, and it'll go on being a great TV series in DVD form.

Like the scene when Mark Harmons car is broken into and the thieves are in there steal stuff and his dog comes out and starts to eat the thiefs food, it' a great scene. The rest is just okay. But it does have its moments, and it is entertainment. I like the soundtrack. It really captivated my attention. It has great songs like "I'll be there for you". I think it was also the theme for Frieds. But it' s still great, it's got a good rhythm and it really fits the movie. I recommend this movie for those who are looking for some entertainment and a few laugh out loud laughs along theyway.<br/>[b]1999[br/><br><b>[i]Comments[/b] by: <b>M.D.<br/></i>[br/><b>[i]Rev: 1<i> (2011-05)[</b>]</I/>[br/><br>Yes!

some of the most amateur footaged I've ever seen. And the acting isn’ t much better. In one of these “found-footagery” films, a group is film their expedition to find and document the legend of Bigfoot. And what they discover is that the mythical beast actually exists. And it' is the size of a house. And the group of scientist and documentary filmmereks are in for the fight of a lifetme when a bigfoot attacks their cabin. And they must use every weapon at their disposed, from knives, to flaming moltov bomb, to shotgons, to even an assault riffle to survive the attack. The acting is horrendous in this film and the acting is very stiff and the dialogue is so wooden. It’s hard to believe that anyone could actually believe that this movie is real. And I’m not even gong into the CGI, because I know that it looks like something out of a 1995 computer game. So, in conclusion, this is a very bad film that you will be glad that yo didn’t spend money for a ticket to watch it, but rather, you should just go and rent a good found-footagedy film. Or just rent any other good horror/thriller. Because that is what this film is trying very hard to be, but it doesn’ it get anywhere
sex-up the busty lady, or some old guilder in a trencoat trying for a bikinilady. But I think it is a serious question. It’s also a question that we should ask ourselves when thinking about our own relationships. Are we really in love? Do we really know what that is? Or is love just an idea of what we think it is? Is love a state of being, or an action that takes a lot more effort? And are there different kinds of ‘loved-ness? I think that the latter is true. And I believe it is important to know what kind we are in. So I will try to break it down for us. But first of all we need a definition of love: “Lust is an unhealthily intenst desire to be with someone of the oppposit sex. Love can’t be described but it is the opposite” – anonymous. So lol… Lets see if that helps us. First of all, let me say: I believe that the best relationships are based off of mutual loneleness or neediness. I also believe, and experience has taught me that love, the feeling of love is not a choice. I don´´t think that we are able, even as adult human-animales, able of controlling our feelings in such a way that they can be turned on an of. It would make sense, wouldn’t it
something out it, too! I think you have to have a child's perspective to understand the movie. I think we adult view it with a critical eye. The kiddies, not so much. I think you're right. They're not thinking of the technicalities of the movie as we are. I think they're just enjoying themselves. :) I'm glad you enjoyed the movie! And that your boys did too! It'd be nice to see it through fresh, innocant, eyes. :) I'm looking forward the next Disney movie! I hope to have kiddies of my on someday so we'll have some movie night fun. :) :) :) :) :) :) :) ;) :P :) :P :) :) :) :-) :-) :p :-P :-p ;) :) ;) :) :) :) :p ;-; ;-p ;-o ;O ;-) :D ;D ;-) :-d ;-) :-d ;-d ;D :O :) :-) :-) :-) :-o :-o :-O :-p :-o :-D :-d :-X ;O :-O :P ;-) ;-) ;) :d :) :-D ;-) :-) :o :D :-O ;) ;-) ;D :-D ;D :-D :) :-D :-p :D :X ;-) ;p ;) :-p ;-) ;-) ;-) ;o :-) :-) :-D :-X :-D ;-) :d ;-)
it was a disgace, but not in a fun way. I was so angry afterwards. And the worst thing is, I'd like a film to explore the thematic territory this film was supposed exploring. But this was just a disgraces. And not a fun disguise. And it made my blood pressure go up! So I'm sorry for the review. But I can't be sorry for how I reacted to it. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to be warened. So that I can't blame you if you watch it and are disappointed in me for not telling you sooner. I just wanted you to hear me. And that' s all this is, it is just an announcment to you. I'm sorry, and you are welcome. And I' m really, truly sorry I've made you watch it and you are welcome to be angry at me. I am sorry that it'll be so long before I see you again and that I will be so sorry I didn 't tell me sooner. I'm sorry that I'd be so sad and that I'm sorry for you. I will be so sad to be in your presence and that my heart would be broken if I could be there. But I'd be so sorry that it would take so long for me to tell the truth to you. I'm not sorry I didn�'
triloggy is a film about Gypsies, but it has no relation with the reality of their daily life. It is an attempt of re-reading their history, a mythical history, in a poppy, colorfull and musical style. A film about Gypsies who never existed, about a Gypson mythology. The story takes us to a time and a land where Gypson' s live in peace with other nations, and where the King has the power to make the rain. A time, when the King' s daughter, who loves a gypon, must marry a prince. Gypons, who are very skilled musicians and who have a lot to tell, are always on the move, but when the time is right, they stop to celebrate, to love, to sing, play and dance, and this is how they make the world go 'around. A world without Gypson is a dead place, where the rain doesn' s rain, and nobody sins any more... Gatliff is not a filmmaker in a traditional meaning of this word. He does not tell a "story" or "show" reality, he rather builds a world, and he builds it in a poppy, colorfull and musical way (he was a rock guitar and drum solo player in a famous band). In this film, Gypons are a metaphor of freedom, the world they build is the freedom of the
