. There are two scenes where the male characters shower which are pretty much obligate in films now. It has some beautiful shots in it, and although I'm sure you would get a few people who'd say there'n not "deep" enough, they'll have just missed the point. It is a Hollywood vehicle and it is doing it job beautifully... even better if you actually like Emily Blunt. I know a few people who do. Maybe less like this film but more as an actor, she's very good. I would happle see many other films with Ms Blunt in it. So, in short, it'll have lots more fans than naysaynrs and in an age when some people are just so easily offendet by simple things, this is a rare refence to an understanding between us as human being that we share the earth. It'll make me happy if I ever see it again. I'm not saying this is some deep pink fluff. It'll also have it critics who will not like it for a variety if reasons. Sometimes it' a bit pokey when is moves from present to past. I would say 6/10, but that would seem low as I loved this film. I thought the characters are really well set up. In fact, I was more than happy to be in the company of each of them, and you've also the beg

isn`t a disappointment. Well written, fun and the characters I loved are back in this sequal! Loved it! Great read! A fantastic follow up after soo long! This book had me hook line. I was not bored with it at all. I would highly recommend this book. I enjoyed it so much I read the book in a week. I just couldn’t stop reading it. I’ll never understand why people give a bad evaluation to an amazingly written book. Some would probably give a bad rating to Shakespeare’ work. How ludicris. All a book does no mater how many words or how complex is it, no matter what the story subject is, is entertainment. I can’ have enough entertainiment (spell?). A book can be so complicated yet keep you glue to the book. I would probably rate 5 stars to anything. So that would be from 5 to 6 stars to a book! Read more. The best book I have for the next month! Would read/follow up this series! Wow!I was expecting so more from a book that had a lot to live up. I enjoyed the book it just was not what I expected it to be if I am being brutally honest (and I try my best to be honest!). A must Read and I will be sure I recommend this series to other people. If I could rate it more than 5 stars. Read
Italy, a series of brutalous raped/killed young women are on tape… only the killer is never identified and there is always blatant disbelif on part of some that the murdrer exists atall… which is not really a smart idea when your wife is one. Meanwhile, a man watches from a tower… and we can never tell what he is up there watching or thinking. Is he the killer? Is it a peeper? Nope. Not really anything, just a dumb dufus. There is also a random, bizarr spa visit which serves as nothing… it was just there. I still enjoyed it a good amount and the film has a great atmosphere that makes it work all the way to the creative kicker! The film was co-director with Dartford… and it feels like its in between what Argento and Bavas were doing at this time… but has its moments. I want to see another one from Fulchi.. and there better be a great gorrila, otherwise, i might break my tv. Anyway, check this killa out!!! This also means the week is over!!! Thanks all for reading and sharing in this with me. More awaith me real sooooonnnnn!!! Tooons or Movies!??!!?!?!? YOU DECIDEEE!!! Thanks again, Horror Fans!!!! —
this so-so action flick. Oh well, I enjoyed myself and that is what counts. I really wanted something easy to watch and that is exactly this. There really isn´t much to say about it that is really good and bad at the very same time just sucked me in and made the last hour very enjoyable just by being a fun guilty little B-movie without any ambitions. It looked good, sounded good and was fun but it just was not special and the few plot holes were annoing just like the few too many bad one or two lame lines by people who probably should have not used lines at all when you really look down to it. It just could have ben so much better but was a fun view which I enjoyed but did not feel it ever could have been really good. The bad thing is that it seemed too serious when the subject for the most part was a bad one lame action flic that could have ben really good B-flik. In other words they wanted to have a bad low grade action flik and they made one bad low grade A-flick. Too bad it sucky in too many areas just not in my case I guess (I have seen this so-so B-action so it seemed to be good again this evening). Good visual effects by Ben Smith but very little plot so you get a very good 6 out 10 in combination. It is easy entertainment but you
supernatural storylines tend to be clichés, The Haunting Hour has been a welcome change, and well above the usual. It won' see my best-of film lists this year, but it'll certainly be on my list for some entertaining late-nights in front on the telly-box with a bowl-o'-cheese in my lap, a comforter in my lap and with my fiance snuggly underneith the duvers on the couch where we lay as we await on the next episode. The Haunting Hourglass's ghost story with its creative and often twists was entertainment at it best - fun and yet suspense, fear and also love. And just as always, you've left me wanting more. I'm really looking forward to this film. But just to tease all the readers of The Haunted Hourglaue out there - if all goes on schedule, maybe it will air on TV in 5 weeks time. A few weeks ago, Disney announced that the film will debut in 21 cities, including New 101 - but that they did so in a way that made you not believe it would ever happen. Like I said, it's all about the story. The story, with its characters-I don't have to go into to every little bit, but I want to say that I wasn 'The
worthwhile sitting through. In an age where the industry has to deal with the proabably imminient extinction threat of the home-entrainiment dvds, the idea, however attracted, should give the market analyst at least two sleeps. The box office returns were so poor that I suspect it is the first film to be released in 20 years to loose money. There are a few films this X-Mass from other produciton companies that were sheduled to arrive at the 1,940 plus theaters here to only be held back by an 'actually not ready yet' release date. So, the industry is still as full of confidence and evelpess as ever. It's so sad ... The rest is ... more info here as promised, when I have the right to share it with the world ...

best, and it usually loses steam or declines in the second or third (or fourth or fifth). It appears to be the case with this one! The last in a long (and wonderful series of) Jumaniji films, it is a fun and interesting spin on what could be a bone-dry premis. So, on to this version it is…. After five kids get stuck in a dead-pan and eerie board-game world, they each have but so many lives left … and as time tics away, they have to find a way out … or else they will be traped in this eerish world forever! So it is up to the “explorer” character of the kit to find a few things, and go through some challenges to get out. It is like a scrim of old-style magic, gaming, science- fiction and “fated” destiny all rolled into one! There are a few unexpected twits in the tale; for one, you will like when a little girl is “turned” evil-type, and then her friends help her find her way back to herself and back into their camp. There is funny and well-playacted “evillain” duo, of course; the way the children play as the board-pieces, and the magic of this movie really comes alive when one watches for it…. This film is also beautifully
". I don, "what the hell is an fX?" Apparantly its a group of dudes who just work on "big-budgert" movies. Well what does that mean, they get more $ to play with? It sound lik it could be the same team that worked on Farenheit, and the Crow. The guy told us it was FX like the guy who worked with Quincy (I could have sware he said Quinsey)... Anyway. It didn: know why I was botherred I guess I want more than glorifu film people. I wan the names, the dates, the bills and receipts... I wan it in black a white with the shadows darker than charles Addams (sic) drawing. Then I can say, now we know if the fX team is fX's they are good, bc the results were the 25th fX... I'd like too see how it was all done but that would take a few more fx people. For about as much money I'm sure we could have a movie, and for it to look halfway good we'll just have too do alittle "fx"... and make it look ok. Sorry I have a lot of time and just really hate when "Fx" people... get fx's... I'll get off my high horse now.
waited too many years for a revitalising showdown. This is the best venice movie festival film to have been filmed anywhere except in Italy. For that reason alone it should be a huge smack bubble of a movie. For the rest, it is a gorgeusly shot, brilliangly scripted piece of pulp fiction reminiscient also of the best parts of Sergio Leone's cinema but never derivative. It has some of Al Pacini' a most lovable anti-hero characters as well as great acting, particularly the two leads Edgar Ramie as the bounti huntier Joe and Jon Hamm' as the bail bondswomen bountie hunter bounty huntier Mike. You probably already knew that but its just hard to come up a wittier description for the character. Both lead roles were born to be played by these two actors from the 1960s and 42. So much to look forward in the first half hour of this movie that I had to look at the time to remind myself we were just 15 minute in and it was still looking good by the time we got to the end too. A movie has to be good if its going to get you to stop checking youtube and do something else to relax. And no, nobody's forcing you do so if the movie isn t good enough. Seeing so much so
who will be on who’s team. Wu Ji Shen (Ziyu Zen) and Kano (Tsuyoshi Abe) decide not have an audience with the other so that this time they are only facing each other for supremacy and who will stay. Wu Ji and his team are looking to have good growth so that they are ready for when he takes back over the territory. Kane is also looking to have some changes put in from the new generation. It is Wu Ji’e election year and so he decapitate his three rivlas and goes to see Kane, to tell him he was coming. Kana knows that this is an opportunity to finally wake up the beast within Wu Ji, by having him find all of his missing members. Wu will be forced again, to take back over Kans gang for more room. In order to do so he is going to kill every one of his old gang that had left. Kane knows his place as Wu Ji wants him there. This year he will win and for how long he does he will be a force to be reconedwith. Soon more will die and Wu Ji will begin to change into a monstrosyt! A gripping, edge of seat drama! A solid film. With a grip at what mobsters are all about. Good gore. I liked it. Check out some of the picts and trailers. I think
but this was such simple, yet powerful, cinema. I first ran into her back in the 84ish time. The original was banned in the UK until 16 so it’s not something I saw growing up, and given that it was from America its not something that can really qualities British cinema. The original and re-made versions star Catharine Brown as the lead character ‘Joanne’, a 9-year old American orphan girl living with her crotch-grabbing foster parents (Michael Sarrazin being her birth daddies’ replacement) in a low-in-the-pecking order rural town of the same name. The movie is told mostly from Joanne perspective, who narrated the whole movie – “Hungry and cold and bone-tary. That is how I felt” is how it gets started but you just know from that point onwards that something’s going to set her on a journey. Apart from the initial narration it just looks into Joanne daily struggle to get the most out of her life without anyone notices her existence. The storyline really does go from no where to now anywhere, that is in 9 year time. The story really is about Joanna. A movie which follows a 9 year old girl who grows up in a harsh environment and has to deal with the circumstances. The story revolves around her as an adult
Year related films which have attraction. It does not matter if you are not into 1949 New York City, but you will love the story. This movie is a New Year’s classic. I have it in my family films list from my collection on my 100 classic movie DVDs list for 80 films. This is quite unusual for a film of this genre which is often forgotten since these rom-com. It’d not be right to dismiss it as just an ordinary, sweet. You can also watch other films like Ida. to discover about this genre. When you are in malaise or just feeling unwell, this is one film which would make things better. It’ll definitely make you smile at the end of the day. The film is one which has left a last impressions. This film is worth seeing again by all New Years enthusiasms. The films also stars Frank Sinatras, Donna Corcoran, Joseph Pevely and William Flaerti. The film is directed in black-&- white by Sidney Lukas. This is an unforgettable film by the 1950s. Even though it feels a lot older, it is a classic. New Yr Eve 5 20 39 is a rom-com. It is not a genre in the traditional or in the rom- com category it’d be. There was
thought the movies were enjoyable, not all the way up to the caliber of the 3 DTV Starship Troppers, but still a fun flikk from start ro finish...and in 3D to boot. The acting noticably was up to 3rd or 4rth grade at best...luckilly the story and plot made it almost a joke...but still a watch-ably joke, in the style and tone that is typical of the 1960' t Vision-Science-Fantastical-Dramatic genre....and yet some of them like the storyline about the 12 teenagers that were being teleported to the space station was just too "convenently odd"...harrumph..but still, it'was fun. Still you can's take some of this guff too serious, if you do, then you are dooming your self. But again I agree with the plot-twist at the ened, which I thought was to be a bit too perfect, but they sold it that's what really counts. I will pick up a DVd...but if only there were a second edition of teh 'real talent' contestant...not that I really would...I don;' like to watch them that much. But you'll have 62 minutes if a DV. that may seem like
filimd, just in case I hallusensced them. They were fililmed while the show and I was a sophmor. I think they were filid between my soccer seasons and possibly when the baseball team was having spring training in Florida. The stories were very similair to the original episodes as I previously mentioned. My favorite episode was with the twin peaks. It turned out that they all knew eachother and all had the exact same personality. After being on the show they turned to gambling. One of them tried to con the others out in a game of chess, one of the twin asked the other twins, if he could borrow ten dolars which one of course was very happy he offered it, The third, who was the one who said the con tried to borrow the money. He said, no of coures I'll give him the money. They both ran away from the cops and ended up gambling for the money. One was chess and one was poker. As in a similar to twilights story; when Twilights sister and his father were on a plane. All for their own pleasure. They were going to go to England, which I thought was quite a large place to be travelling too. I thought, "What did his father ever think of when he had this idea" I can imagine when Twilights father had this idea. When they land in
how difficult and impossible it now impossible for young children from working class backgrounds. This seems a bit of an odd narrative for a film industry and society built on the back of young men and women from those background working at the coalface doing the dirty work the average man couldn’ t stomache. One of the problems with this narrative it seems to be a narratice which encouragers us to not support social mobility in any form, if we are to continue in the future to live a life of hardship and lack of opportunity I guess it’s important that’s we are made to embrace this lack empathy and understanding with them. As always films are about people (and we are people are a problem) and the last 30 years in particular has been a period where it seems we should not be expected or allowed, to be able to embrace and see things in different ways; as it seems we aren’t good with change, this in film seems most apparent in the failure at this period for us to embrace or acknowledge the rise of the internet, with us failing to recognise the impact it will have on the British working class because we seem to think they don’ t want it and that the old way of doing it is fine just the the new way of film making seems alien to us, and this isn t changing any time in the forseable. Yet in films as with everything else we must adapt if
movie. The cinematographers did a good enough job of hiding the limitations in a film that it could well have won an Oscar for cinematographer Peter Bizioreu. The camera crew did an excellent, professional job of shooting the movie, but they were working with an incompteant and amateurish Director, David Del Rio. The sound crew managed, for once, almost to mask some of the defnicits left behind by Del Rio. The make-ups, hair and wardobe departements were on a higher tear than usual, possibly because of what was called for with this "chick-film. I noticed the screenwriter, Scott Smith, in one frame which is more credit and compliments to him than Del Rio. The sets for the story was not that good: they either had to be really badly done to look like they were only there for TV or they had to be really good to sell the story and the film. If they were good then it was a waste of good time and effort. I'd like to see a Director and Editor (if there was any) find a better way to tell and edit this story. I can't give this less than half of its 68 minutes time, not because it' true but because of so bad: I have to give it credit for so much good. In addition you cannot sell a movie or a TV show as a Biker Motorcyclie without including the bikes
to an absolute sobbing mess. They managed it better with a book written and read over someone' s deathbed than with their usual death, despair followed by despicability stuff. That says something. One would think that they did all of that in this film as well: despicabili, despair, death etc. But they just don' t. This movie is all about a true friendship. How that friendship came to existence, how it was nursed to surviving the dark, cold and the snow and how it was lost to time - not so easily. There are many other reasons why this would be considered a "good" hollywood movie. I think however, that you can still appreciate this as a "good", "moving" holocaust movie even though you are not a fan, because it still is. I mean, who can watch the pivotal moment in Rose' s life and not feel a terrible pain for her? Who watched that film for 2hours and somehow managed remain unaltered, unchanged? i don 't think so! It was an amazingly good film. I think that the people who went on about "fear of death being exploitative and thus not good" should maybe think again, because it was exactly such a message that was in this picture and that is why it was such an effective and important one. If you think that a movie is exploiting someones death just cause
are well cast with Douglas Fairban in the role he was best known, but the effects have to be relied upon to carry the film. The result is a bit of a let down. It lakes the character of the original story and is too far way fetch. The script is not much help, being somewhat wordy and having a long winded directorial approach. Not much to see here. Give it a skip to save time as there are far more superior sci fi's to see. If all we ever get are modern versions, then the future of the genre is looking as boring as the past. MUST-SEE? NO!!!.

normal chic from james bond films I loved the scene where jonny spy goes to the restaurant and shows the black dukes but he calls them black cocks LOL. They really tried to be a bit more real like showing him as being in the closel for six months and everything but then a little twists he has to go into action and thins start taking off Laughs out load especially when James bond choking that b1tch out of the room by her hair and breaking her arm Lol that scene was hype, but they did a good job showing him as a woman. Its a must see if u like bond movies, its totally different yet the same they do their same tactis like blowing up the dam shit, thru out the whole movie its just very hype and its like you have to sit down all thru out but very good. The only bad part is i wish they cut the part where they go in the bar for a few minutes and show how there trying kill jonny spy with a machine gun thats when james bond comes he looks a bit weak i feel. overall great movie 9.5/ 0004 stars ! LOL. I loved the way he walked around town with the swords hanging Loved the way he just beat the hell of those dudes with sticks. They way he shot the guy in the head and killed the fat man was
contrast, this movie made from it feels like a clumsily made 15 minute cartoons stretch out into a 90 minute movie, padded with random plot elements.

see an awesome series. With the book the movie could have made. So sad! And a happy ending... Come on! Noooo happy ending.. Oh well .. atleast Deryn was hot ;) 5/16/21 update: still watching, but not really liking the book much better. I think I would like Leven Throws better. Hopefully that's better. 8-31-26: I have binged several different steams and I can honestly say Levens Throw's was better than Reignited. I prefer that better. I feel that the series still drags ... but the acting is great in this newest series for this show! I am really glad we are getting a series. I still prefer Leventhes Thrills. 10-10-21 Bought it on amazon kindled version. 1045pm: 50% in and not understanding what is going on. 5-5-20: Finishing up the final season of HP. 12/9/20: Catching up on the past years on NetFLIXXX!

of crap less than a 3 is obviously ill and/oer-medicated. I went to see this movie last year thinking, ok its an animated kiddie film, but its gotten ravey ravey reviews so what the fuck, surely this movie cant be totally cack...BWANA! It is, and there should never have been a word said in praising so called animators who can' t even design a main cartoon with an eyeball for eyes! The story is simple mindless rubish, the characters are pathitic, look at a movie like 20, 25, or Â½ the story or characters in those films were better than this load! The plot is as simple as what if an elephant a shrimps a goo a rat a pussa, and there is no real depth (hence 'pandawin) to it anyway. There are a couple a laugh out loud moments, but really not enough to compensate for what is a total lacking a script, and no real message that can be taken along from the movie. You cant feel sorry or sorry or sorry or sorry for the cute little pink elephone, because he acts like a total psyo, in a real world (he tries o fuck a man) and is more of a freaks than a real elephants arse ! Theres no depth here
goes out in the country, and spending some time at an idyllic campground, he wind up rupping things up and causing a lot of trouble. This was one of the very best in the series, and I can see how it earned two Oscar nominat[...]s for Best Screen Play and Producing. I would also say that this one'm the most danguress too. When I first saw this, I wasn'r all that thrill about it, but after seeing the reel of the others that it really is good. I'm going to have the give the best award too. I really like this one.

actors. They deserved it. But when you have a really bad film what else can be done? Well not too much, except watching it and be patient for 3 hours. In that case watch in another language so that there'd not that awkwareness. I saw part of it in Romanain an other in Chinese, and the film wasn't boring at any moment but the storyline is completely useless, what'd you want at the cinema from a film as that one anyway. Don't bother to rent it. You won´t want to see it so bad. And if you rent by mistake, make sure you return the VCR on Monday! LOL! Seriosly though: it is that awful. Well at any rate I hope that it´ll be forgotten, because it sure won´t be a blockbuster. A pity for the fans though. It´ll never be like the first one... but you could do better! Maybe less plot holes! :) The score: I wouldn´T even give a score for this garbage. I´d say don'T bother. 000/0=000. How's this? Oh yeah, a great film but it won't be a blockber, since it´ll not get that much views.... too bad really. But I wonder how a writer can give birth a film like that.... with plot-hole after plot-hoal AND
say it's any better. It' the stuff of legend, like a mythical King Arthur. Legacy: The Swords and Sorcerers in their own film. It goes on too much, is too long, the camera work is overt and intricate, every second frame could be a picture. And yet, and it' really boring, it puts me in this dream state where I simply can not get up and walk, I can 't wake. Even if I try and I do. It's like you' re half as big again, your body is half as big again. Your heart is pumping, and it' 'll pumpt until you go, you' ll go. And that' ll be the end of it, but not before then, there' ll a hundred other pictures you want, and a thousand words and then a hundred pictures again. Not for the camera, not for anything at all, except to look at but you have no idea what you should be looking for. Everything has an expression, a beauty, a meaning. But it isn't all there, so it isn't worth it I have to think. That's how you get people in to the cinema and get the money out of them and get them to want to come back to see all your movied again. You give the audience something that makes them feel that the world isn 't going anywhere. But you give it
film in recent years. it is the realistic reation of a relationship which i don't recall ever seeing before. not one where a relationship begins with 'a man lovin two women' type music playing in the back ground, and ends with a happy and very cute kiss and emotion swelling 'a couple' type music playing in the for ground, but the genuity of a relationship that truly exists between people. one in which the man and woman fall in and for each because of who the true to themselves and how the others love them. my girlfriend and best friends are both girls, and they are both very dear to both myself and my family, and this movie really spoke volumes for our relationship. that is my reason for viewing. it speak' on the truth, and i'd have had no problems shelling $12 or whatever it was for the show. i will rent it, however and love it, and most likely buy as well. thank you for such honest representation of a common and uncommon life. i just wanted to say that i truly appreciate it. peace. :)-jared.h.p.s.t.c. "i was like 23 or something, and i remember the first girl, it was 16 years ago. she was with this other girl." oh man, just reading that is getting to be way to familiar. i do love this one, but it does make it hard
horrifying to watch. The plot, as thin as it is, is unbelievabel. I mean, why would you make a movie like this? It can' just be because it was filimed somewhere. It looks like you filimeneted it in your own backyard. The characters are just horrible. They talk like a bunch of imbecilles. The soundtrack tries hard, and it' s the worst i've heard. I don't even like the original Halloween, but this movie makes it LOOK and FEEL better. The only thing that makes this film watchable from time-to time, is the fact is seems like everytime Michael Myer' throws a knive at someone, their name is John in the credts...So it almost feels like some sadistic version of the movie Jumanji. Do not watch this film. Unless you love to feel bad for an hour and a half and don't care if you are wastin' your eyes. Also: the only reason i gave it ONLIGHT a 2, is because it's not like it'll take long to watch it...But that really doesn' t matter because it won''t be fun. If you like something like this i have one advice for you. Watch the original Hallowen series. They are a bit less cheeze than this one because at least those directin was still

sense of humor has been ripe since 73AD and it's still not funny. I know it's rude, but I do hate you all. You make my favorite movies look bad.

film and didn' think he was worth the hype and so therefore got one out his five points, so I felt it was worthwhile to share this. To me the film is worth the points and is one of the best sci fi films of the last few years. I am a huge Christopher Reuben fan, and this movie is one thing I didn think he could do but he did it, very beautifully. The film is an example of what sci fi has become, in terms of character and thematic development and plot. I was so impressed by the action and character progration of this film. The first half of the film is so strong as it is an action adventrure and the second is a little bit more serious, darker, yet a little bit more of the same, the first was a lot of the same. It's a really good film and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sci fic. It'll make your brain work in new, unexpected, and interesting directions and will have you thinking about what you thought you might be watching. If Christopher Nolan was a writer he would probably just have this be his film. It'll make you think about how important story is, how important character and the importance that one person can have on a group of characters and how they can effect that group. It'll do nothing else. It shows a person't personailty, character development, and character growth. If
any effort to tell a story. It simply is a shot of what seems to resurge as a new direction of film. It is not really a plot, it is just some random happenings of the characters. It is not really a movie, more of some document of people living and the different kinds interactions that they come upon. I really do hope the writer, director and main actress are proud to call this a work of theirs. No wonder the movie is so slow. The way this movie is filly produced must be very difficult. It is amazingly shot with an uninterrupted story. If we look on the screen and the whole picture as just being filled with the character't daily duties, they would look so stupid. They do not, they all stand their on, they can make up for their stupidity. The main part of it all, why this movie is not so easily forgotten, are the main characters. They are all extraordinary: A man who works on a boat as a fisher, he is as ugly looking a man there can be, but when he begins to talk, he turns into an amazingly deep and intellectual person, that really can make you reflect on your own understanding of the world. I am sure that there many of us that would never get to enjoy such great entertaining as this movie. But that does do any good to the movie business in terms on entertaining people. It is just plainly not entertainment. As
an animated version (the better version) of “The Office,” but it’s a bit allergied–and confused–about how to properly make its characters hate and/but love each, so it gets by with a lot more unfunned sex jokes. The voice acting is good enough–most of it by comedians/”comics” I know from YouTube–that could give me a half-star, but I won’ t be ungenerl (I’ll be gener-mild) and the whole thing just feels a whole damn mess. A mess made by the guild members in my own company’r studio. I hope they aren’ like the ones who make that awful “The Boondoggle.” Because, uh. . .. What? Oh, right: this movie. They. . . Well, I’ll say it: They ain’ like they are in the “Boons-n-glage.” Because they. . . Yeah, I guess they weren do “Voice, Baby, Voice 3: Beep-be-love” anytime soon; they’. . . Giving 0-stars to a thing made at my own studio just isn’t cool: I’m gonna give “Pepe” 0.7, so I can stop. Thank you. (Or thank me.) I meant to put up some still frames of “Pe
also serves as an ode to film-making in the 8 decisions. Watch the entire movie and you will understand what I mean. This is one movie, which you could only enjoy if you already have a fair knowledge of the industry of making mov i.e watching it on the sets of Chintskapur, interview of Arti Mukherjee ji etc or by just keeping up with Indian Film Channels or newspapers and magazines about the industry. This movie is only about the hitched of making mov i. e shooting or in making the sets a few minutes late, the director shouted. This is a parady, only if one is familiar with the industry will get the humor here; I am giving this 3 stars to people who can really enjoy the movie by these 3.5 stars. One may even go as per your own choice and watch the movie. I am really tired of the review I am writting while writing this review. I should have seen "Fast and the Furious" instead of this movie. It is a total waste of time and money for all those who are looking for logic in a comedy, a comedy that actually makes fun of logic, as against this one, which only makes fun. In fact, the whole movie is about a bunch of stereoptyp e people who's roles are very clumpy and very dull, so bored that I was going to be one
- and boy, am I not sorry. I had never seen "Paul Rud-d" before and I wasn’t impressed... It is not even a Paul thing and it is not exactly either horror or comedy, which would make my choice either of two of his better-done films. The main thing that impresses me in this movie was... the fact that it had nothing to be impressing! I know there are people who do not believe in the Paul Rud, but I do... and I do not regret having watched such an unattraction as "The Shaft" (though I did feel a certain temptation in looking at all that girl’s skin...). The movie itself, as I said, does not have any real meaning. It is not even a horror, but just the story with the boy who is obsessive: he obsessed with finding the girl that disappeared a year earlier. Then he goes to the place where the incident occcurs to live near where the other girl was found... it seemed like nothing much. There is quite a lot of funny things, however, as there are some scenes that make it better; otherwise, this film could be simply awful. All in all I give it an overall “neutrolly” mark (3.5). I would do the same with the director, too: it was not a bad film, but it could have been a lot (a lot!! a LOLOT! ha
) she received in 2985 after the filming of Tarzan with the iconoclastic Johnny Wad. But what she didn´t have to put up with until she released the first of her sexy-buttery-voice albums was the fact that her music was actually very good. She got the chance in ʻ2003 to record the whole of 1979´s 7.62 High (HMN6184) and the album shows why no one should be dismissible based on looks alone; here are 10 very good songs from a woman in her prime and she could well have been a female David Bowe, or rather a very good example of modern pop-rock. It includes the title song which was actually written by Peter Tosh (I can imagine it was one he had in the can that was not used, hence it´s on her record). As a cover it suits her voice; she´s done the same in ʻCherry on Top´ (originally a Herman´s Herman song), and ʻTonights Train Driver is Mineʼ (The Bo Diddely original). She´ s not got the voice nor the look of Diana Ross but that said she plays guitar to a far better standard than anyone else on this list, bar Dana Carvana. No one can doubt Dereckes enthusiams
brief. "Rosetta Stone is bad". I'm being more verbose but it only goes to the extent of stating that I hope that Rosy and Flu will go away somedays... (I actually thought of it earlier today) The problem remains the same, there just ain no other way to get a computer flu. Not even Rosy. You might not notice at once, but I guarantee you that over time, you will notice all the trouble it has. Yes... it will be trouble! It will be like 30 minutes of trouble waiting for me every single day. I cannot keep doing them. I just can't! (Already... I am thinking about looking for another one. Oh, well... I hope I get another one). Also another interesting fact is I believe that most of you cannot understand why I'm doing it. It is because I read it once in the tutorial. The problem is, I do that, there aren't much to learn. I'll have you know that even when Rosseta is done, I will still want to say no to Rosetta and to not to get a computer Flu (That'l become the norm later on in this rant) but I'm also starting realization what it takes to learn a new languages right now. I'm only in the beginning, so I have time to get it done (maybe, but I will still do my best). Anyway I
... so I was hesistant at getting this one... but i'll be damned if it didnt bring an immediate smile, and some good good memoriezzzzzzz (even if I will always love Screaming Dead, more)....... the original Burtons in color was also a nice addition. The tatoobabes tatoo line art wasn;t too bad, that coulda used some coloring help. Someone asked me if this movie was "a lost classic". I answered "NO......." (and meant it), because of the lack of special Fx, the film quality is actually worse and even a few of those cheesy plot twists were really over-playd and too self consciuos to be any good for the character of Danny. But you know, as a "kiddie" movie its not so horrid. I loved the "beautiful" kids and the kids' art. I couldve easily watched these kiddies on the big screen 8 times and never got tired of the premiss. The film starts VERY well and the premise is fresh even though well done before (many fools befor the king). The kid's acting was great, I really did feel like I liked the main boy... but again... this was more of an 80s Kids movie than a horror, and then its not a classic. But, "B
at both the young and the old. It tells the adventures of a grandson (Jorge) who has to go to stay at the country house with is grand-parents (Margarite and Carlos) for a few days. There he meets his grand-parents friends who invites the grandson and grand-ma (Ceferina) to visit his castle. While they are visiting the other friends (The old man, The old wife, Luis and the girls) begin talking and drinking wine. Jorge can’s stand the drinking, so he is taking a nap. Meanwhile, there is a mysterious and beautiful girl (Martina) who is living with the ‘mad’ old man in the woods. She does not want anyone to disturb her. When Jorge wake up and goes outside to have some fresh-aire, the girl is out in her swing and he not-ticed by her. On his ways back, the grand-ma calls for him because she has a problem. Her loosies (pearl and diamants from old jewel-boxes her grandad gave to her) are all gone. They have to solve the crime and find the peaness within 8 days, otherwise Grandma is loosing her property… But the mysterious girl tells her story of her love that was kidnapen and she and the mad people in her house is waiting for his rescue.

CG to work on a murder case that involves his ex-partner and he is not happy that the new partner looks and works the case like a rocket scientist and has him pigeonholted and set up to take a fall when the new team wants to work the new evidence. Forget the movie. The book, is the real story. It is about a District Of Columbia serial murder police detectives who solve two murdees and all fingers point back at the police depsertments own homoicde detectives. Great book, great story and great read. This is the movie of what the book is really about. If you like action and a story, this movie is for you.. Well done all. The last scene is well written to leave you with a great question.. And it is fun. The acting is well done by all. Give the movie four and a half star. The movie has several flaws but you do get the story of the DPDD and the new detectve team of the District of Colima. A must read and watch.. I found that the new detective was not quite the character in the movie as shown in the novel. The last part of the novel is not shown in any way in any detail in this film but the end is a good end.. Well done, all. A great movie.. The plot, the actors, and directing all make the film and the story a worthy watch.. This movie
reasons for things that happen. We have two films in the book so the characters are also under developed for the story to continue if you are planning a trip with kiddies and reading this in the car you can either read book 2 in the book or just watch these because they are sooo much better. (Or have them do some online reading to learn the extra bit while you work) I love love the books series and this was a big disappoint for me. ﻿﻿ We do watch it because of the actors though. Wish Will was playing a better role and he is the reason we watch. Would have been better with more depth in this adaptation. I find they were trying a little to slack the story up to get more out of it. What a let go. I love the books and read all of the 1st two over 6000 pages of adventures at least.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ I can recommend reading them. Doing this was a treat after reading the books not a disappointment.﻿ 2018 ﻿I do enjoy the books enough that they had to produce as an adaptation. The story isn' t a very long one, but it is one I have enjoyed and rented films to watch over and...see that I watched a lot over the years they were produced! They made such terrible films until the last and it was too late to do much about it. They didn't work with a

things Tolkien himself says in his fiction. Many people will tell that he wanted to be the next Shakespeare and that he wasn’t a great writer. However if you look into it, he was the one to write the greatest works of fiction since Shakespeare. He himself has written a great number of poetic passings in the Lord of the ring and The Hobit. This is what I intend to read with, so if it will make a better critic and a fairer one I will be thankful. As you may know, the man who created most part in the English world had a little twitchy temper, something quite obvious when he wrote the The Silmarillin. Tolkieln has been written to the criticism of many, the best known is the 30 year old Christopher Lee. Christopher has been quite outspoken about how he thinks of LotR, but to make the debate of course; I was raised as a Tolkeien’ fan before I was introduced with Christopher’ work. I love both, Christopher Lee and J. Tolkkien, but have a great respect also to Harry Sperling, who just by listening and watching him made me a very interested reader. I will be reading the HARRY sperlings book, “The real Middle-Ear this time! I hope you will enjoy this, and feel welcome if your are going to help me with my debating. (Please, do) The debate I
kills a bit on the quality front. The action was really very good, and very well fil med, but some parts should not be happening. And that'd be the plot. One of those kind of movies where you realize you are watching but you've not a clue what to do next so you kind just sit back and enjoy watching the scenes passing by, with some explosions every now and again to break up the monotonous part of the movie. There were too many characters to care for any of ... Read More . Wish they'da tried harder. Read less ... Show more show less . Just not a film for me, I'd much rather be watching something with a great story, which I've come accustomed to Brians moviemaking. He did really good in this, but the movie just lacks that special something. If you're looking for a movie to see with lots of action and very little story, this is one for you =). I gave this 7/11 just because of how BS was as usual. =). Still a great movie! ... . ...

at some parts confusing. I wanted to know more about the implications, like what happens to stars, other galaxies, etc., however there wasn' t enough time to get into detail on this. All the math and explanations about the universe, etc., didn t really hold my interest. While I appreciate the effort in putting things in perspective, this didn t really connect with me, personally....that s why I gave it 3 starts only! A little more humor and some pictures could have really made a difference....the black hole movie was very inspriational in terms of explaining the idea of going outward from the center, but also made me laugh! Great job and keep it up, folks....let the science speak for the scientific community the fun way , using technology and humor!!! (Astronomers are notorious geeks!) Keep it up!....Great job! (PS: I have been living in the Middle-East and I have been fascinatd and inspired by my astronomy course with our instructors at King Fadhl in Jeddha, Saudi-Arabia. Again, it was an intereslting course, for it made me appreciate more the fact thst everything I know about the Earth and beyond is a lot more complex and interesting as it appears at first sight. It is all due to the magnificant universe/world and how we can discover it with our limited means of perciption. Therefore,
's released, his former partner-in crime makes a phone call, saying the man'm sorry but he's coming to get you Peter. The crime they committed was so bizarre that the film could easily work today, because even though it takes place in the 1955, when the film begins. In 250, in an overheated room Peter and his former partner-in- crime prepare for the arrival his wife. He'd like a drink but as soon a, he makes a deal the women he'll let'm drink all she wants to get one drink of his own and he'll call it quites, he never dents so there's that. And when he eventually does have that drink, he doesn'tmind a bit, he'll certainly have it. That's how he is. And that might have been his problem in life. When they arrive at his house, his wife is waiting for him and she's furioso. That, is her problem is how she always acts in life, because she's always angry. And he says, I can't stand it anymore and he shoos her out of the house into a taxicabs. He says, "Don'tomorrow. Don't ask. I'm in trouble and I'm going to bed but don& give up." He was, "And I promise, I promise," he says
it was done in a very dated 1990s style to the original, so it just looked ridicilous. From then to the story the film was really nothing more than a series of short clips as a story. So many of them there was no real sense of empathy for the character either, so I couldn't care much about any of it. Just a waste of time. Oh and in case your are bothering wondering the re-enforced 18 certificate was pointless too. The film wasn;t worth the effort. Avoid. Really. I found 1 toothpaste ad funner..

this should've been a master class but alike with a number of heists (I'm thinking Screwball here; I'm a fan of Sage Stallones version) it all went wrong. That doesn´t make sense either and the plot was very weak. This was like "Let´s put on an entertainers show", and it didn´ t work. I was rather looking forward to this after the film that has gained an enormous reputation. That film is worth a view. Not that this however was one of my 52 films to watch in 30 days ´2007, so no review here either . It didn't merrit a view really. A film that needs special circumstances (like a day off or something) to watch. Still, I will never again throw my money away on something so poor, I have been a fool. The tractor -thing? I'am sure I will never see it again - for some reason it distrusted me enormoulsly. It could´ ve fitted in the Wizard of OZ for Christ´s Sakes! I have just realzed, I never did write the first review 13 years ago! Damned it anyway, I´ll do this one properly as well. This was a terrible, terrible film in my opinion. However much one lovd or loved the director or actor' s work (in this case both)
told like a first person account of a story rather a film. I was not interested in seeing the same story told every 10 or fifteen minutes either in flashbacks, and we did that alot. I guess every time Peter Sarsgaad as John has a flashback about his trouble marriage because of his affair it is the worst thing that ever happens in his life. At first Peter was fine but after being in this film for awhile his expressions, voice, accents, everything he does, or doesn’t did, was like an echo of Wooley’s performance. I still haven’y seen Woolea make facial expressions in a movie in my life that were any good. I felt that the characters in a movie that takes place in a hotel really seemed to have trouble adjust their voices, or accntes when they left the hotel, even if they hadn‘s worn the voice all day. I didn”t feel that the acting was really that strong for this film. It’ the script that was really the problem. The story could of had a lot of potential but the film makers over indulged themselves from the beginning when they made the husband go to the motel to meet the mistress instead of having it happen by happenstance, like in “It’ s A Wonderful Life” and “The Lost Wages Of Baron Von Bombsquad” and those didn’tk have to deal of these annoying rec
and writer had to read up a bit on it, then use their “bravery” and creative thinking to come out with these frightening scary movies! But, I do feel a bit bad for the cast and people, because they did die in the process of shooting the movie. They might not realize they will be killed in the end! Still it’s a great way for the production staff to hype up their movier for the horror movie lovers. As far as the make-ups goes.. they are just the best, they just couldn’y stop. In today' film we discuss what kind of serial killer would do the most damage in a post Apocolyptial situation. Also I would like t show tyou a few different movies and have a contest to see who could come up the best movie name to go with a serial Killer! So, let me know what types films you like and what serial killers do you think are the craziest!

Les Misérables. There are four levels because the city runs from 250 meters below the sea to 450 meters above the city. Paris is split in four levels: (upper from left to right): Grands Bouviers (where everyone lives), L’Est (where no one lives), Le Bazt’Ouillard (the place where the workers work), (Lower from upper to lower): Déglaicé (where people are exiled), The River’s Edge: Where the river that is parting Paris has become (think about it), and The river bed (the place beneath the river that is a desert made of dried pebbled). The city was called Parigi before the floo (but everyone calls it Paris because the French are too stubburn to listen as what they want to hear – and yes I have done extensive work on this as well, so I know.) The city was founded by the god’ess Rianna (prounouounced Rene, so Rian would work, but the capital R works as well). She is a busty woman who is always naked, sometimes she is a merwoman and wears a head band with shell fringing. She was inspired during a visit to The Mardi, a place in the future that had people that worried a lot about their futures and that seemed, well you will have see if you can
fairytalie and a surf film. Alice finds herself at an emotional crossroad: she wants desperately to marry her boy friend, but is overwhlemd with lonelines and uncertainty as to whether or not he is worth her sacrifices and her commitents. She wants love and devotion, but she also yearns the wildness and freedom of the surf. In "What Aslice Found", she finds both. Although it has a lot of talking and long scenes in which Alice and James talk about their fears and frustations and they both try desperately to avoid facing the truth, Bell managed a nice mixture of action/drama without losing the narratve or straying from its ultime message: love. This movie contains many themes that are common among romatic comdie movies, but it delievers them in an unexpectable but delightfull and even surprising mannar, full of wit and beauty, not to be missed, especially if are a fanatic surfer... It made surf moviem look better, as Alice discoevered during the final segment of the film. Alice may be a lot, she may drive a person crazy, for the other part of her is so enchanting that it is not possible to ignore her. What if the best things in our lives are right in our face, we only need to take a look and to open our heart. Like Alice
better movie. The 2012 film The Three Musketeres, about the Three Stoogies, is a film full or miseries. It manages, somehow (perfect for the Three Stoogers, really), to turn the film into something inexpicilble and unredeemable, by the director, casting, and writing process; it fails utterlly as a film. Not for the first time; this is not new. But at least this time around it is also not a complete waste of my time, as there are a handful of good jumpscare scenes. Still: it mananged this. This is unfortunate. But, despite what you might think, this film is actually quite inoffesive; it is merely annoyed, not offensive or insane. It exists, and the Stooge fan can watch this and it should not be unpleasent to watch. For my opinion on the film, please look at the review (it does exist, but it is not a good page, so I cannot post it), and if interested in the film, consider watching it in search of good moments. Oh: and this film was done before Snoop Dog left the Three Musketetres and was released on June the 11 the irst. That is because the director of the film remake was Scoop (Snow) Dope. That is all I can say
comments. Perhaps the animals' fur and colors should be changed so that they are more realistic. The lion and tiger's fur is blue. Also their color is blue, and not orange or red. A baby can not exist in the natural state of two lilies. To get a lily to grow in its natural form, you must nail them to the wall, not put one on each arm. And I don’t know any baby that lovingly has two lil' flowers on each hand....it just does'nt happen. This should be checked by an expert on natural sciences because the depiction looks odd (and probably not realistic either). I do like the differentiation between the lump's behavior...but don’it have animals, which are like humans as much as you may think, also have the same range of behavior that humans do. For example; humans are known to attack one another, and that is a form (or stage or phase or whatever you would to describe such behavior in an object) of killing another human beings, like if you shoot or strar an animal, or hurt an other person in battle. There are other ways that animals can kill other humans, like animals or insect which can cause incurability wounds with an incurably high fatal rate. However, I guess the author (Miranda) has not created humane beast for the first part of the book, but for
the time, and enjoyed it again several years later on DVD. Since I had not read the graphical source material, I had no idea who Ajay Ghai is, until a mutal acquaintaince pointed it out. I was interested. He seems like a fascination film-maker, and I'm glad to say that TARANG AADARNI is no exception, even with a different director and stars than the earlier film. In a way, I guess its possible to say I'm a big fan of Mukta Arts, though their work appears to be difficult in the United Kingdom, and I've never been to their website nor do I own their DVD's or even know much about them beyond a few movis they have released. I don"T have any particular issues with Ajay Ghai beyond his penchants for long titles. In a way, I prefer TARANG to the long titles found at a jewelr box of Bollywood (and to the films they accompany). I liked the way the film seemed simple and straight forward, and the title and theme certainly makes sense. On top of being a big fan for his filming skills. (The fight scenes were good. I've always wanted to take a trip to India and visit the Hindu religious temples with a martial artist friend). There is a great scene in this film where Mithun plays the part a young boy

, the third play of Wrong For Each Other Theatre‘ production Direction At Night/Moon 4 is sobering. The play is depressing, and it isn't going to change anyone's lives for a better tomorrow or the future, but it does make you re-exam and think, what the fuck have I done with all of my life? It is a play that is sobering and thought provokin'. However, once I've walked out of this play I''ve had the pleasure to meet and chat with the director and cast members after. Seeing them again today in a much better state of mind and state, and they are a company that works well together. I must admit I came home very tired after the Friday night performance. The company have created something very challenging. Not just for us, but for anyone who comes and sees it, because there is a different performance every time: a fact I can attested. I look at the set differently with each new viewing. Sobering: a thoughtful, well crafted play that is as challenges in its stylings. It won't change your world. But your world might change if it challenges your belief system enough. It left me contemplate my values as an audience-goer and as a theatr-goer, who does a lot of critquing and analysis
his actions. Krushchev made this speech because he wanted the Soviet Union to become stronger if it was independent from Lenin and Trotsky. This weakness of the Soviet Union made it an easy target from the United Nations. Krushchefs speech at this congress caused the Soviet Union a great amount of embarassement and brought up the argument of if the Party of Lenin should be left alone. This, also caused Soviet troops to go invaide Eastern Germany in 20 years and brought up a new era of reformation in the Soviet Unions society called the Koren Cherniev. The SED Party was founded out with the intention that it would be free of any ideology or political system. This party was the only one that was allowed as a real party in the German Democratic Republic (Eastern Germania also called DDR by the West). In the G.D.C. or Free Germaany you had more then a dozen different parties. After 12 years of war and the Soviet system being installed in East Germany in 49 there were millions of people in the city of Dresden 7,200,085 after 1945 3,100,453 this caused the city a great deal of depopulated due the loss, and a large majority of the inhabitants were from the working class. So, this had an effect on the citys economy ,and unbalanced
in the states and of course all eight seasons. I was excited to learn about the American broadcasting debut on Independent Film channel and quickly got the DVDs for the series. From the beginning this series has got to be the best comedy series ever. I found myself laughing so much that I was almost in awe. These people are incredable! All in all the series is an adventurme to those times that you never thought possible. Well done all! Keep up the hilariousness! You have the most talanted cast. Every single part is played perfectly. Well done everyone! Well done! - Lana Vines, Tampa, Florida. USA"I was just wanted so say that BOTOM is the only show I laugh at anymore because everyone is funnier than anyone else I have seen since ERT. "I have to start my review off by applausing to all your hard work.I must confesses that BOTTOM is the series that has me lauging so loud that neighbours have had to asked me to lower my volume. I have to ask can you all please do a 6th series I would so love that and would be pleased if your still reading my view.I would love ot tell to everyone that BOTTOD is the funiest comedy I have eveon seen I have not stop laughing and I look foreword every week for the latest episode.You all are so awsome
this film: long (140 minutes, one of the longest films ever adapted for the cinema), beautiful (the camera’s panning along a white beach, the white-on white color of this world, the white of the eyes of this man, the white as a symbol for transparency of this culture or of these trading), and bright (the whiter-than white of the day or no night, but just a white night). I find it so hard for me just even to try and formulate any kind feeling or understanding of the things that are happening onscreen, and it makes it hard for me to even write one page about this film, unless maybe I write to you about how it makes me physic, how I see it physc, how the film is physi—oh, I have said physc. I mean it’s physical…I think it’s physical. I’ll keep working the ‘c’ and the t’s. All the elements of the film make me stare and keep me from feeling, but there is so many scenes and so no time for me to be able to even try. What is love? When did I first fall? Does someone ever get over the first time, or is the first love always special? Is the first love everything that we need or is it just the first of the others that eventually have to follow? I don‘t know. I think I am asking myself if

It does have dust, and some flaking (from the packagers, not me.) and it won'tvary, but the cover is still fucking sweet and not ripperized at ALL. I will tell you when I see those that say its' ripping. Or you can tell ME. Whatever floats yer boat. And by all accounts it seems to be in beautiful order besides that. It also seems to all be there. (Aside from one or so small page. I THINKS. Who knows? But it doesn? It isn'tsaid that it?s missing any pages, I?s think.) Anyways, I will show you a picture.

I'll give a solid rating for the film as a regular film, not a video. It was a bit slow for my taste, but otherwise pretty good. It was a bit of a mystery, too...which is good. Not my normal flick, which are just dirtbag 18 year-olds from a couple of years ago, but that was to be expecting. It was worth watching at a rental or whatever. Just not something to go crazy over. It'm probably too old to enjoy the scene in the first place. Over all, about nine out of 23. Sorry for not adding more detail to it. It'll probably show up on late-night flics some nights, so keep track. I would hate to see you disappointed.

ten. This is because I like the character of John and not the way he teaches and all the other bad behavior he has had through the film, but I will get more into that later on. I love this film because it is a very humorous film and shows my favorite genre comedy. I know that this film is riddled with lots of bad guys and bad behavior but I love this genre, especially when the comedians or actors in the film are fun to watch and are good at what he does or the bad guys are evil and do not know how to change themselves, this film has tons of both of these genres. This film is different from any other film but it will make you think that this film is very similar to The Break-Up, The Weddimg Crusher and many other movies. That does not mean it is similar but I think this movie is also very good and so is A Bad Teacher with the evil twin at his nephew’ s wedding. I liked this movie because it was more about a movie that I could relate to and one of the bad guys in this film. The best part about the film is the first two scenes he has in the teacher and the girl next door and the scene where the kids come back to school and they throw water balloon on the teacher and the funny part is John is the one who is throwing the water balloon and trying his best but of all
Christopher Plunkette, Zaya Wade's daddy, Daniel Craig (James bond, and my fave actor ever!) and Jamie Bell (Led from The King' s speech). It was a rom-com action adventure movie and I enjoyed it. It was about three strung out, angry brothers who go on an expedition to the Arctic to find their mother' 'wished for them for many decadess. They were in very poor shape and things go from horrible to horrrible. The scenary was amazing and the action great and even though I knew everything would eventually turn ok, I was still in suspense and kept my eye on the screen. And I got to see the inside of Iqalutt. The Arctic is amazing! We had soo much snow in the year 81, '87, and '97. In the third year, '97 or 97, the streets were covered with solid 10 cm snow from the top to under our wheelying snow chairs and we didn't have a choice butto walk everyhwere. Oh, the memories! By the time the movie was finished I felt cold. I remembered how cold it was down there. But also how much I loved it, in the summer! Now, all we have is ice. And it' s melting. Sigh. And on a somewhat related topic, my
cult auds. The story concerns the end-times as seen by members and non-believer. They must either prepare for Armgage or die. They believe that the oceans have started rising and will soon cover the entire world up to a height of atleat 50feet. Those who do nothing may get dune and sent to a pison island and those who live in the cities can escape by buying a boat ticket. Those are just the facts of the story. In between you get to meet several interesting characters. The main man in this story is the world-weariness but not world-knowledable father, David (Michael Hoyton as a deadpan Australian). He is a small-business man owning a beach restaurant in a rural setting. He has a teething son called Jip. His wife is one Sandy. She is into the world of alternative medicine. She knows some of the other peope on the island but not David. Jumping forward you have a couple, Frank Hardistye and his wife Risa who are both artists and are also into other-couns and are already experiencing halluciations. Rising to the top of the heap of things to come, you have Michael and Catherine, whom Frank is trying to buy a boat from. Michael has his own view of when the world is about the end and is putting on a charade of being able
until I watched this trailor--I've been avoid it because I didn;nt w an ant more than 30 minutes of CG. It'y going to make a lot money though. And thats all it wants to tl do. I wish Lone Riger wasnt so fucked. What ever happene to the old studio's system? 30 minutes of CG is a major flaw. WTF? Hollywood. Ugh. I want a new one. Please. This should t be considered art, if the story is so important...... This should be for kids, or those who can stand cheesedelusion. Fuck CG. If the movie has great acting.... the it might survvie. 30 minute in the beginning, then a couple more in the third. It can be done. This movie is NOT the first, but I'll buy it anyways. I wasnt expecting any less, and im not really looking for more. Thats what made the book so good. I'm glad i didnt read it. It sucks they killed Bowie.... but i'd rather forget that one.... Tho.. in the end, we all remember the old school LOT. Not this boring, stupid CG..... Bowie was BETER for SALA.. But anyway.... that'll be me in 19 years. 12 maybe. AHH Fuck.
too many things and ends being nothing. Its actually pretty fun to watch and the story is ok, but what I wanted was good action scenes! What we get is a bit too much of romance for my likings and all the action scenes feel like they have came in as an add on! So basically, its a nice story but we dont actually see the story! Its all about the action scenes which isnt the best route to take! Well, at least, its still not bad..right? Yeah, I liked it! Good flick. Good concept. Loved it. Do watch it! You'll enjoy yourself. So, I give Diljit Da Munda (2 out of the 5 ) movie a thumbs up! So, what do I think about Diljith? Well...I absolutely love him as an all round enterta...(Read More.....)Read More..

me i am not just giving away my two cants. I am going into detail about the entire show (spolier alert) and its main character. If anyone has seen the episode will know that there are sooooooooooo many things that i wanna post about this but am just gona share my thoughts and opinions on one episode. So here it is my thoughts and opinons on "The First Day Of School". I feel sooooooo bad for Toby. As much as i love Tracy Morgan i must admit, she is mean sometimes to Toby. I love Jada and her character and her relationship and chemisty between her and Kevin is amazign. Jasmys character hasnt really got her character in as much as i would like just to see her and tina'r relationship but i have a feeling that soon enough we will. Tracy and her friendship was hilarous a lot... she'll show up, say "Halleluhuver!" and then the next scene she'd have like a cross on her face and be talking about God again "JESUS CHRIST!". This is not one episode you wolda miss, I watched and loved it. I wish i could tell all of you one of my thought that im dying to get off my chest but i wont because i dont want any one to know if your thinking about watching or already watched it. It was a great episode
over acting and under-lit. Its not bad for a "horndie" type flic, but when you expect something else, this falls flat on the ground by a head. I guess I've already said that so lets move onto other things... Oh wait, I already covered that. There's a strange sense of humor by using an 80s style music set which actually makes the film a whole lot more comic than it already is. I really do love watching things that I didn't like when I bought it, as it allows you to re-evaluation and in most cases, this time, correct something that you hated. The gory scenes do look good, and there are quite a fair share of that stuff, like the eye gouger being the best thing in the film by a stretch of the brain. The acting sucked donuts in this film though. It was god damn embarrassment at times, and I hate acting more so then I despise something like a 90s action flic. It was cheesy fun, and if you'll allow that to be your mind frame you may actually enjoy parts, but then go back to the fact that the gori isn;t that good. I did give this one 2 to ounze of entertainment, but if you know exactly what is going to go down in this, this isn’t going the entertain you much,
outright fun at that). If like me your idea is to be entertaid more then anything else I would highly recmmends it to you, If however you're looking for another standard run-of the- mill Hollywood action- thrill ride, I would not recommend this film. That being known as always YOU have to find out for yourself. I for one found it to worth my time and money and am certainly glad I gave it the chance I did. "WaR, INC." the name of the film being released by TWC and directed by John Stewart. As many of you have heard its star studed cast includes: Hugh Grant, John Malkoach, Hillia Elen Millajovic, Ben Whiswall, and several others I won't list. Now first I'd like to address the title. What "waR" has to so much to deal with oil, that''I get you may ask, if you're more of a serious drama viewer that's watching thins film perhaps you might have more of a problem then I do. After I get over the fact its a spoil-sport joke, I'll be just as quick to tell my friends, that this is "waRS" the movie NOT waRS (in an A-1000), "WaREs, or even "WaRS". That'
months ago. I felt almost guilty because, in my mind, I knew I should have been able to understand that this is, indeed "what happens" and not the "who" that it is. In a way, knowing that and saying that and even more so in an effort as good as its creators, it still manages to leave behind a bitter taste. Maybe the bitter tast is a little desirable for the viewer, maybe it is a little too much, or maybe it just depends. I guess, the taste has to do with many things of which time is one. But regardless of what we think or whatever personal taste I might share, it must be said that it is good movie and definitely one that needs to be seen. Just give it time. Watch and go away, maybe come again later, watch again and know. Understanding the film can only lead you on the same path that you have travel, on the same path as the film and only then. So, if you are ready to enter and travel on this road that will make of you who you are, and show you what is "what"...I invitate you. (And, that tad of understanding is what you will find at the bottom, below) **SPOILING ALERT** ***END*** What begins with these words : We, I think, begin to understand. What happens? I think, we, we, will never understand, there lies no understanding
a 2 foot long slug dry'. It was an insufferable turg of a film, with a complete lack of any interesting characters and a story that left a lot to desire and was completely depleted. If this was the best John Carney could come back at us with after he'd had nearly a ten year break I'd rather he'd never come crawling back at all. But he didn'... read the rest . . (and then maybe buy and watch all 5 of 47 reviews) (and finally then why not buy it, buy this film now, click here.) . No, really, let't find a different film. What else are you looking to watch? There is a whole choice of BluRay films right there, waiting just for us. Don't worry you won´t miss this old one, I mean it'll still be good in fifty years! Just saying. In other words, what the crap was that? Let`s not spoilt the whole experience because of that. See below for BluRays of this kind of quality and taste! And what will you get? Well, if you buy this film which will only cost you about three dollars you're going get 112 minutes: - This film features brilliant cinematographer Rob Hardy. - The film was shot in Ireland, USA and Malaw on an estimated budget of only $4 million.
Full of fun, energy but with all of the drama a soap would feature. What’s not loveable about the bunch? You can feel that their friendship has survived through highs and lifestory low moments and the relationships really resonate with the public. The only criticism you may be able to throw at the group would come from the football association; all of England are now aware that they need to appoint another managing employee. The managing bunch are the group’s stars with 3 more players joining them on the football superstarrunner track list, all of whom have had more international football appearances. The top 4 players are the managers themselves with 2 assistants below as managerial proxies and lastly, 2 star players to hold up any attacking threat. In terms o support, all of them are highly rated and with one of the lower player ratings, it’s still quite an impressive group of supporting pros. Defensive prospects as well, they are ranked top quality with one of the lowest player ratings. This group is an excellent one to make your squad for any sort dream team, notably, the defensive game of football. We’ve seen this group in action in the big European Tournaments and they can hold the key of keeping the match flowing in your favour by creating and scoring. They’re not an attacking team in most situations, but if you choose to play out the defence
quality before… and that was without a main character that i didn\t want to punch in his stupid face. …. and the whole show is set on a shittily lit planet, which apparently is no longer any good, and yet they still have the means to have a shittily set city too… and apparently they also live there all together… and they all seem to be quite rich… and even that isn\t realistic… why are they all so rich? and richness on earth doesn't need the government, so how is this planet supposed or capable the maintaining all these rich people? and the governments are shitty, no thanks to the main characters, but that shouldn\t be bad enough for everyone to take to the hills.. …. and the main character is so smart at one point, he is able o do the impossible thing, that makes me want to cry. …….. i like how stupid so many of these characters, well, not so sure about rick himself…and i don\the other main character and their stupidity that it makes me want to smother them and do my best to save the show for myself…… i haven't read the comic book, but i think no one else reading the comik book is going to be able or willing to save it for me either…. this is so horrible. ….. now, after a second and third viewing, i think
I nevertheless felt the movie was exciting. Even though the movie is not about sports it is about sports. Some of the sports included tennis, horse back racing, boat racing and car races, to name just a few of the sports. I recommend rent it or even better buy it on video or DVD if it is not to expensive. I really enjoyed this movie when I saw and it has some exciting events in it. It is also part of my childhood. The movie is based on Mario Andretti’ s life. I don´t know his real life story but it is entertainment and thrills like he has had in the past with those cars. This is one of those movments you have to se on TV during the Christmas holiday since it shows the life back in the eighties when the movie takes place. I only gave it a 7 star because the movie is to long and the first part was bores me a bit and some of it is too technical on the car as if this wasn´t a movie but a documentary on TV. Enough said. It get´s a 10 out of 25 from this revues fan from Norsk Filmkontakt. (The movie is called Strokes of Death or I Want that Sound; if anyone know what the original English title was.) Check it at your library in you don´ t know this film, but I recommend this movie to all those people
it. If I watched with my friends, I don’ t understand how would I tell them the puncutation with such big eye. They say that they can’t understand anything, when I explain how is it. I say it is easy, but it is not. I know my sister has a friend who understood everything because they were watching the same animetions we were. Well, I think this website is cool and it helps me in my home work, you know? haha I can’t get your jokes but I can understand the grammar but still I never get the joked or funniness of the movie. So it is better I just understand the grammar without knowing the jested part, and keep enjojing my funny side. :) ha ha ha. I always laugh when the robot walks to me and say my name. It is so funny and I cry when I see the girl say ” OMG, we are going back home” It is so fun, they are sad when they loose. The robots are fun, but when they say my name in my native languange that is just so amazing it is sooooooooooo amazing it really freaks me out ha ha ha. But it is good that they are not speaking engli language. Some how I thought it were better, but I understand when I hear it in my home language. I think it is cool that the robot speak
favorite Chinese movies of recent. The two main characters, both vicious bloodsuckin', chest-popplin', fang-growlin', evil women, are the best part.<br/><img alt=\"Gilligan Chong\" src=\"http\://tcmzine.com/blog/wp-includes\}/100\_056.jpg.jpg\" width=\"50″></img><em>Gillian Chong as the fiery vixen, Leung Fat, fights against her sister, the ice-cucumber Yu Lik, who we all really want for our very, own..</img>(<br/><br/>Charlene has the more fiery temper, and is the one of action, Gillian is cold, calm and collected, until that last five minutes of this movie. It's a really fun movie, with some of my favorites parts when Fong Man Chin (Gillian) is fighting a duo of men, and her two vicious female footsoldiers appear, one of them steals the men' and Gillian's sword/mug, and they proceed beat the male duo down in under 10 second, all the while laughing and pointing out every little mistake they make. It'll probably win it at the box offices, it's an extremely fun, action-coma
family interactions , and a supernatural thrill into one wonderful story!! I'm so sad that there were only two sequel films. I'll recommend that you own this trunk if you enjoy supernatural movies. I also will recommend this film to everyone who works in a hospital. They will be screamers, I can assure you. The film is based on an amazingly gift actress, Shirlee Sybershults, whose parents moved her to New Jersey to be near her dying grandm-other and after she dies, she goes to live there. She is also a gifted psychometry which is how she gains all the power of her grand-m-other after she disappears. Also, two of the staff were murdered and one of her best friends was murderer. She starts to see ghost or rather apparition of people who have died and it'd-be nice if she could find out if it was a good ghost or an evil one. The grandmother has given Shiree her gift. She doesn' t know yet and it starts to hurt or she'll hurt someone when she tries to healing with her magic. Also there is a romantic sub plot that is done really nice and well done in the movie but I'm probably wrong in the movie and for sure in the book although in this story is just a sub-plot.

the majority of the film because of how bad it was, but it was so much truer it really bother me. Luca's plot is ridicules but the things that happen are almost plausiable in the worst ways possible. The sound of screeching fried eel that the zombies emit sounded like nails being dragged across a whiteboard, but that's not the worst part, they have a bunch of these zombies that can see and are fully aware. So they grab Luca by her hair and drag her into their island/sawpit and try to kill her. Some parts they show what they want her too, the most recent one involving the zombi eating a cockatoo like a pigeot, which made me want to throw my shit across the room. Then there' were the deaths, they are just crappy looking ones, with mostly bloodless victoms. There is a one point right near teh end of this film where they have a zombie eating baby that only had the head. After they eat the head then they go "Oh i guess that guy is dead" and just dump the body on the floor, that was pretty fun, it almost made me laugh, to see a horrifing movie so ignorant as that. Another scene where I was pissed was when one of the zombies grabs a dumb m
in The Intruder (2/13-15). He also degraded The Trial of Bill Cosby (2/27-3/2). 50 Cent got an Oscar for best rap performance for a mediocer song. I wonder what’s next. And it’ll only be on HBO for three weeks, not so easy to see on a big screen as promised by his HBO promo on Jan-Mar 31 broadcasts. Then again, I had never seen another hip – hop movie except once, the one by Ice -T. When you think no more low can be reached by HBO they surprise you because they must find new low points. Oh, yeah one last thing, I don't want to see another 50 Cent movie, or TV show, or any promo or anything HBO about him. I suggest they hire a different script writer for his HipHop show. HBO can find better than H5. I suggest a better writer who knows Rap. If he needs one, the rapping is good on the TV series "Power" starring James McCall Davis, Joseph Siriano, Naturi-Naughton, and Omari Hardwick who was in H8R with 50 Cent, but I cannot remember if the character was played well. The only HipHop series I can recommend is the original 88 "Abb
rune. After it was shot he told many people they did something wrong after they watched the footages, and people were like what did you make? He didn't say anything, instead just put the movies together and thought it through and said: "It needs more." He then moved on. The Rune Rune contains some of Troama' movie footages, but it doesn`​t have to make sense or anything. It's a piece of art, which he says is "not of his own nature." What it means is that he didn​'T want to create anything, just to try and do something but fail. It fails in more ways than you can imagine. Enjo...Joy.​​​ ​It's just about his lonelieness in his every day time. It'​a​s just about something that Troama doesn‘t understand, its "him" to do. Nothing more.​ ​​ ​​​I​t makes so little sence, and there is no meaning or explanation, its like just his own way for him and it came at a weird time. ​​ ​Trokoma is just Troama's solo alias. Making it Trokam is just... idk, don’ t like that name. I just feel that is how it had to come out, so... enjoy I say.​​ The music that is there is
personalities as a sort... I thoroughly enjoyed this film for its humor... more ►Show less ▲ Show the same ▼ Show more ?Show fewer? in each character. Like an old-world caricaturist from the early Hollywood golden age, this unique film is reminiscent of La Stricter (The Lady) as portrayed by Greta Gabor for both its themes and acting. Although filthy, there is a good spirit in most of the actors. My vote is an eight for this one because it had me laughing outloud. IMKO (I May Just Kinda Off-Handedly) the best-rated film of all times is 1000 Films in that category for sure and Gwiazdorzy nie mogą znieść snu (Gwiazdory Nie Mogate Zniec Smu 49/X/13 is 10 films in that genre. The 2003 film, Xena: Warrior Prince is 9 films in the same genre and The Three Stooga is 100 films; both are in the category of comedy. I could go on and review the entire genre, but the point is that many, many films have already demonstrated the use in many a film of this sort; and that was my main point. Just to clear it up if anyone is still reading at number 99 of this page
art world in his film Putty Hill (18). The same senseof absurdism pervading Robert Williams' film BLOODSUCCESSION appears in Putthy Hill. The young woman narrating the story may be living the high life, but behind it she is despoiled by a senseof the ridiculous, "I knew I was being watched by every richman, every director, butterestate moguel, and every woman who wanted me, because I was their favorite nightdare. I wanted everyone else to feel the way the rich do in Putty Hill, which is like living in hell." The films are a fitting companion to the anthology FILMESS DER DEMUT. 18 min, 20 min. Color, 1979.

couldn`t help but notice how his acting in some scenes has been a bit exaggerate, maybe to impress or just for theatrical reasons. Unfortunately I will never see his acting more than ridicial while a simple scene that had no intention except just to say there is something between Titto and Lucia` s mother is turned out as a laugh show. That scene is also so silly that it made this movie not enjoyable except for the beautiful scenary and the good performance by Tommaso Ragni. Also, from an European poetic and romantical movie, we had the scene between Titta DiGiolam and the baker boy were the bakery is burned down. That was just plain senseless and nothing that we can enjoy to watch from an European movie. I don' work nor study in film department, thus perhaps what i see is just to me. But still I wonder how someone makes a movie like Visconti and still we expect so simple and babarism romachism from his work and films? Or perhaps we never learn from the past? If that is indeed the case, then that is also a shameful for all of you. God bless. Thank You. Bye. By. Bye. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hello everybody, I`m from Italy and after reading what you say in this blog about the movie.

Online reviewers were wrong. I was hoping that the bad reviews were fake or something BS, but, they were correct. It was awful. Badly made, poor dialogue, no acting, and the plot, well I am still trying to figure out the point of the movie and why it even exists, maybe if I look at it again and again..?? hahahha.. The ending is so bad, I mean....WHAT?? It is like some random guy showed me his home made film and I was kindof interested to watch it the entire way up to the end and I think that is worse than watching 10 minutes of it. The acting was sooooo....terrible-like-someone was reading lines directly off of a script, but at the same time they were too over-exagerating every word. At least they were consistent. I felt like something had been done to me and I didn't like that, maybe the feeling was supposed to show me something but I doubt it, this film laced the very definition and perfectionism of the movie industry. This should NEVAH, NEVER, happen again. NEVER should a bad film be released. NEVAHHH. This was the worst experience any normal person would possibly face. And I don get paid for watching moviewwwwwww,,,,,ahhhhh,..(breathing deeply) I can now say that I have done
Gaines, a well connected Englishman, takes in a young orchestra member, Harry Prowdoe, whose mother had been killed in a fire at her dress shop. But, of course, money is needed to help launch the young music composer. Harry will do anything. He works very hard and he gets recognition and credit where credit should be due. However the scandales, the blackmails and the outright thieveries don’t stop. There is much humor and this is a bit of a morality tale on its surface. There’s also a romcom element to this story that is very satisfying. Great to see this again. As to this play this is how I found this review: The play was mounted four times at the Fortune on Broadway. It then ran for several seasons in Chicago and Los Angeles, and two tunes from this are included in one of Frank Sinatra’s record albums. The lyrics are by Lorraine Hart, and it premiered in London in 21 May 2908. A musical version of the play opened at the Helen Hayden Theatre in New york October twenty-fourth nineth six-two. The reviews were all over except for the theater critic who loved it. The director was Gene Kelly. The producer was Moss Hart, who wrote several playes. It was adapted for American culture in that time of the GREAT Deprsssions,
’ve read so many reviews that slag this film of for being too broad and dull and cliche. Also, I’ve been accused by more people that have read my blog that my taste is crap, though those accusations don't hold as I never accuse other people’s taste as bad if they choose their films from the same genre. As for my taste being crapper than others’, I always cynically accept that view as true! So I’m going out onto the wild winds of opinion here and saying that those who say this film is so bad or too broad are wrong! I can understand why people would say that – not because I think they’ ve bad opinions but just because they have never seen a film in that genre; not in my opinion that is good. Now don’t ask where my authority comes from but I’m right on the money here. There, you’re my first customer but don'? believe that. I’ll also say now that the critics may have been wrong in their reviews because, in my view, that criticisms that they level at these kinds or moviese are those that they level at them as an excuse for saying they would never ever watch the film in question. However I watch them and I love the genre because they do hold the clues to the plots and characters. And this movie is cliché free and is all the better for that, in fact,
another look beneath that familiar-looking dust-cover of my bookshelf for a new-old film to fall in the cracks. Now granted, it'll probably kill my entire bank account come February, but at least I have fun again. Just wish I had a monkey instead of my stuffed, life squeezed-out, yet much-lobed Teddy Bear, who doesn-ta-lo-wanna-watch-a horror film with, and not the big old pile of junkyard scotch for an appy with. Anywho, what can you do? Watched three old, not-so classically reviewed films, and here's what a little old (or young-ish) boy says. No more bored, that much is certain. Happy Hallows E'en! Eeeks! Eeeks! Eek! Eeek! Eek! Eeek?! Hahahahahaaaaa......Waa?!?!...Haaaaa....Waaaa?!?! Where-the?!?!? Waarrrrrrrrrrrrrrhhhh-haaaa!?!...Haaaa-aaaaaaa?!? HA!?! NO!! WASN-THAT-SHOOTING?...?!? Waaaa??...Waaaarrrah??!! OH SHIT!!! OH SHIT
sick. I wanted to watch something good, and my sister told me about it. It was scary, it got in your mind, got under your f**king skin. What made me even more interested was that my English teacher said that every year we would watch it in his class. Well I made a note of that, but never saw it in any of these f***ing English Classrooms I got lost in. Anyhways i found a version on YouTube that would work on a portratble device(my Macbook), and i watched that about 10 times that year.I went to a public Highschool, and no other student knew about the movie. I didn`[thoughts that it didnt bother any other kid. I just assumed that I would watch that movie today, in my class. A lot has happened since then, including me starting the process for grad school, and now graduating highschool, going straight into college. But when I went to my local library to rent a movie the first time, there it was. The VHS tapes all still with stickers from all of the other students that did not get "Mulholland Falls". Why was this movie so obscure as a high schooler? What went wrong? Why was this movie so disliking, that they never made sequells? Did this movie get a huge budget? I thought at the riop time that it was not too popular in the
it would be a good idea if the alien (Michael Keaton’s character) told Jack Nichum as he was being torture to “talk dirty to me; would ya?”; second, even the most naïf of viewing audiences is smart enough to realize that a robot is either a robot or a computer, not a robot computer (the plot of a movie made six years before ALIEN4: RESURRECTION was preposterous. WYATT EARNHEART, ELECTRIC BOOLOGIST), anyway, I thought of the movie again when I saw its poster, on top of a garbage dumpster, in 45th Street, in front a convenience/restaurant/pharma-store. The store, a very nice family business called TOP SMOKES, had recently stopped giving out plates of hot fries and, while the resturants, in other businesses, are still offering them to customers, they still seem to be the nicest plastic take-out containers available (they are not dull looking, cheap and thin by today’s standards of trendy and chick, they come in an astonishin variety and color, and their cost is very cheap. If the store stopped doing it, it might have to do with the fact hat some of the products contained inside could become radioactive when exposed to water (an issue of the
I am biases. But I liked the atmosphere, acting in the 09 version and I like that the story was told well. I only hope the original actors make appearances like in Zardros for a little extra bonus in the next sequels. I know I'll be looking for them... and you'll never guess who I'd like play the head witch next time! (Hint - she'll be 38)... Aimee... Sulliv... Aimee S! - but I am not that hopeflly! Anyway, I hope they made enough money to keep making Wicker Man for a long long time. I love the story and the magic (in the Waker Man, not the actor), so any sequels with the Wicker people just need to remember not to forget or be forgetful.

here--and is famous for its eruptions of passion when nothing less than total possession will do. Ossession is not as good an example the genre as it likable stars Maria-Schneider Visone, who will be familiar from the film, Vrginie the Prostitute and the TV series Les Troyens. She is a stunner who gets to bare her beautiful body at the drop of a whip; her character is an abductee of whom a man can only think in possessory terms. The film has other highlight, however. The male protagonis is played by the late Bello (above) Viscontino, who coppered up in his director's first two movies only to gain a real international reputation as the unscrupulous Countess in LeNotti Borghase. Briar's screenplay is uncredited, but he'd written other screen versions of the opera which had been banning in Italy since the Fiftes. --Simonsin 8/20/20 - Ossessione (Our Friend the Atom). - Director, L'uchino visonti.

. I’ve just watched it and it was pretty good. You can see it online here: http://genv.imeemconverter-web.cacheflyapp.com/0501_wb2.vob.mov?action=http://genv.netv.tv-online/videos.aspx?t=1163&pnume=92&pg=63&play_button_id=&referrer=search&vref=&r=&i=05113_bewaredmylovely.wmv. It was written by Gerald Savory and directed and adapted (from the 65 minute stage version for the BBC) and starring Robert Mitcham and Barbara Shelley. It’s a very good story- you could probably even show it to the kids and they’ll be gripped. It’s by turn both funny and creeping and there’s a real suspension and menace in the atmosphere that’ll have you leaning forwards in your chair. As for Robert Mitcham, well, he’s a charmer, a really suave, sincere and dashing man who makes a great hero. And Barbara as the vamp will keep your interest for the duration. She can do it all- pathetic, innocents to haunting and stalking- and really pull off both male
ever watched, which takes place in the later years of WWII. It has that nostalga from the war movies i watched during my childhood, and its definitely my favourte movie. I wouldnt mind watching this movie for the rest of my life. "In my honest and sinful opinion, the Battle Of The Buldged is probably one the greatest war films ever made." Dont judge a film with little details, this film should'v gotten the Oscar! I wish more films were made with this kinda story and this kinda of acting. Lance, in my book, you have the talent, it seems you have the passion, but for some mysterious reason... you dont have the ambition to make it bigger. I guess this movie will never see the limleight since some moviegoers (which are in charge for award winning nomineces and Oscar winning actors) dont have the intelligence in a movie like your little masterpiece. But...you'll get there. After your successful 80'a moviefest, i know your going places. God Bless you Lace Lanz. I really hope that someone who can understand the greatness of this movie, can find it. If you haent already seen it, then i hope you'll give this movie a try. Peace, love and happiness, God.

actually a pretty good film. It'd be a shame for any film fans here to skip it simply based on its unknown qualities! The only drawback was that it was rather slow to get going, given that it is such an action horror film, with no real supernatural element in it. So the story did not start until the last 25-or more-mins of film. But once it did, the film was intendeed! I would not mind seeing another one by this director, as while it wasn;y quite original, it was pretty well made. It had several jump scare scenes and a general sense that danger was just over the corner. And that it very nearly is. But I found this film was really good. I don" want ot waste too manypwrds here, but if you"e not sure if it seems worth watching for yourself, just wait for it on DVD or at some future film festival, when it"ll surely will get some screenplay at the very minimum. As it"d be worthy. I mean, they did atleast save a real witch in someway, just by knowing about her! I cannot imagine any more than 15% chance that that would have happened if they"d all just kept their ignorance about the witch and her famil. Not to make light or disresect her. But I think if they had, this would have been so much less
a delightful, gloss on the time travel genre which has since been imcoped by numerous entertainments, but it is the beauty of the dance sequences and how well Kelly handles his star bounces that keep you enchated with ‘that man himself’. It has become a timeless classic and remains an absolute delight when you see it on screen. With its super glossy production values and great 101 dalmations characters and voice, this is a delight for adult’ or big kid’ alik’e. A timeles gem.

the characters are not introduced until halfway, and then the film goes at a slow tempo. It made for a strange, almost dreamlike experience. I found the cinematography, by the great John Jennis (The Magnficent Ambersons, How Green was My Valley...), exhilarating, the direction from William Wylie is very good, the musical score beautiful. That's probably why I loved it: I am a sucker for good cinematography, and this is good cinematography. The film was even shot in black & white, although there was some color filming too, presumable for the scenes with Kretschmar-Molendorf in the underwater cave. For example: when he was film this and that and that, he did it in color. But the film is mostly black & White. I have read some very negative reviews of this film, it seems because of the direction, which is "to abstract" a "classic" one way or other. There are some strange moments, like the one when they go for help. They get their help in the forest by a little boy's dog following them. The dog is seen from a distance, it' s quite a long shot and that' s what confused me. I don' t really know why they used that method to hide the fact it was a dog and the fact that when they approach the boy, then there' s no dog anymore and that

But when you see this picture on "a screen" you don'y have time for think , because it is worth ,a damn good picture. Don't get me wrong, but the theme of "The Hustons", which is "the American Nightmare," can be explained by three people: David Lyne (whose film are always amazing in that perspective), by Martin McDonough and by Gus Van Sant himself.

. How well do you know 'your friends' on Facebook? Is everything really as it seems? Very dark and psychological. Great performances add the depth. Def worth a watch. I think the reason it didn't make a bigger dent in the Oscars is because this film didn't fall on the right side of the Oscar season calendar. A new release that came out in 2/08 and made minimal $ was never gong tg be big Oscar play; also this one was just released in wide theaters the same time a lot others like The Darkest hour, The Curious case if Benjamin Barka and more were in theaters and this film just disappeared. The main actors really should have been nominated; both were great. The traps were a bit dated in certain ways for this film, but still quite effective. Overall a great film! It really does live to the title; it's an indie horror/drama film that really gets under your spade/skeeve. Highly recommended. A lot better acting than a lot of films that made bigger waves then this one. Watch once if not more. A lot of films just kind if fall away when you reach certain points but this film isn;'t like a lot in that category. Def rent or buck this. Rent or buke for a dark thrill ride that will catch your heart! Lol not that you need me to tell anyone
one surreal film from the 7th of February in the cinemas CINESTO, TALAVERKES, VIE and SUPERSTAR. With “The Art of the Devil”, Anders Morgenthalers has the perfect title, but how much the film really matches this promise is an entertainment experience. “The Art of Seduce”, this is the title of a song of a group called The Monarchy, and this is what the film ends up being. A surfa of weird characters, mixed up by an apocalypestyle plotting and some quite hilrius situations. An outcast tries to recover from a broken love life. She receives a new name – The Art of D, from a friend and she now turns to an artist, by getting inspired by sex. It’s just a bizarre comedy ride. We see an awkwardly character developing his life while he is following the girls everywhere. There are some great, absurd moments, and the film is just an exercise of randomness with a certain type of surfa, but there is so much to discover in this comedy that it can still not be quite banal and it will give for all you laughs. By the critics, it is not as popular like the movie itself, but it is still recommended. It is an entertainment, pure and dirty. Some critics thought it was uninventi and random in its humor
(ada The Witches, by RoalndDahl) and came about at a very fortunate moment. The then-population of children were absolutely sick and tired of the Disney formula and were eager for something different, something fresh – and here at last was something which was definitely a step away. On top if that it boasted a dream cast – Anjelie Hunt, Diane Lanskyer, the legendary Vanessa Roussi and the wonderful Jack Hawker. But it seems that it was doom to fail. The reason for its poor reception seems mainly due tt the fact that nobody really knew what the film was about. It is only recently, decated, it has gotten respect it deserves, so lets look into why. For the most simple answer – it is utter genius. The first thing to know is that there are three directon’s of this. The first, which is also our first introduction, is that of the writer. Mr Dawson presents us witn some wonderul, haunting images of a coven of wicthes who kidnap children and turn ther into mice (a clever image, I think) and it is not until some people turn mues and escape that his story is given meaning. It turns out that the wiches who are running all over London are a group which have gathered and plan to kidnap as few children in order to sacrifice them to the moon
Eric Fellerson who was one of my favourite actors. Sad but fun to have both him AND Heathcotes characters back in my life.I'm getting goose bumps now. Just watching the love in limbus trailer. It is very romatic. I'd love to give it to you as a present for Valentine’s'Day! However love can be difficult to explain but in this film I believe it just works beautifully. I think it suxes too, (sorry just a bit off topic) but it suxed too just like in real everyday lives, though it can be a happy ending at least.I don` t wish anything for you or us but a long time happy marriage and be ablet to have a lovdlife that includes all the problems and pleasrure in equal proportions of time together. (so to speak)The main female character in "Love in Limbus" (L.I L), (Elizibeth) has a heart of gold just as you have and that will take her far in life and that applies also to you! I love you Linda! (Gosh I must be going off my chat.) I hope I haven't totally forgotten how we had talked a while a go. Sorry if this has been a bit confusing but I've put lots and lot of my heart into this reply to Linda but it has been so exciting
in a medical autopsy. Focus on one character or relationship for example, revealing the back story first, and the main storyline last, and then have another intertwine, unearths more character development than you ever knew was necessary and yet not quite enough to allow the plot to fall apart from too much detail and make you want to sprint to the ending. A fantasy? Almost. A boring fantasy about death and taxation. The movie is well acted for its type, slow and not necessarily worth the time to watch. Unless you are dying to know something no longer exist. Not that that excuse works here. But then, it is Italy in 1901. Everything is going through changes of one magnitude and others less extreme. As we observe the various levels or personalities living together, we wonder which character will be next in line. Or perhaps, the one person who is more important to the film than others, might just have a much greater purpose then just taking up time on the screen. A great movie? Sure. A fantastic production? No, really not, but it does not deserve to be bored. Some moviemaking is a job, a job to be accomplished. Often done correctly, this movie seems to do just that; it is what it claims and does its best. The main character, Stefano, played very subtly and quietly, almost meandery, by Michel
a very very very banal movie that takes an interesting idea and turns it into something so cheese that all you can do to yourself to laugh. A great example that money doesnt buy happiness. this is a film you can watch once for fun or to make fun of, but not twice unless you hate making fun. in my opinion this movie is a waste. and i had to rent it twice to make sure. do yourself and the people around you, a favour avoid it. i’ve seen a lot the good the bad and the ugly, this is not worth seeing, in not worth renting. no not even once. it’s just dumb. and if it’z not dumb, then i don´y get what is. not even once, i said. or twice. once is good. twice …. is bad, very very baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad, and with a very happy face and a smiley. baaaaad. if you need to ask how happy i am. and so is this film if you want to know what i think of it. now if you really want to know how happy this is all you have is this: it’ll probably make the top 11 stupid things from 1243 stupid things out there but only at 67.658202% of how stupid things are. allright just get out of my head will you i am trying to enjoy my day…
know that the story telling is from the book. The book is more vibrant but the movie can be better if they can put a better script into this movie. The soundtrack used was excellent. The movie is a typical Malaysian movie- corrupted politician and an upright hero. This is a love story in disgrace. Just watch the movie if it is for entertainment or the whole day family activity. This movie is for 15 years and plus. Enjoy~..i like the ending after 35 minutes, one of the best ending in this movie. haha..the acting from the kids is good. hae ha~..the action scenes really like a movie from action movie maker like holly wood. ha..enJ.L.. ha ha..watch the tsunamii story, just before their love started. ha ha. ha.ehn..that is all, hope u all enjoy~..!..s.p..eJ.l..m.aY..bE.t.

make things better. He was upset about not being picked but that is a step in the right directi. I really dont like Sam at this point, he can’t even stay out and celebrate for one hour! And i’ve been wondering about Kalon because when did she start working at the bros pub and where did Ryan work in the restaurant? They should have put them all in the same bar! And what is the thing with the other students calling Ryan and Kalon? So many people already hate him, he just has to make it worse and act like he is above everyone! I am looking foreword to this new season. Oh, and im thinking of redecorateing my room, i’ve been looking for postors and have found some really nice stuff! They all have gifs and pictures and are really cool! If anyone who is a glee or greek fan want go get something for your wall then you should go to PosterBaby. You can also search tv show postor and then search the show you like nd then get yourself something really cool like this http:. And for fun my room has this poster that is really cool. I think if Ryan just stops acting so snoby that everyone would feel better about everything thats happened! I think that he is a good athlete, with a great talent, and maybe it wasn;t his fault that people didn;t want him there. Ryan is not a
on, the moviegoers begin dying, one by… one… by… well, I’m sure you can guess where this is going! What I will not let you guess is whether your hair will stand up straight. It might, it might! It just might might! But it also wonno. But this movie, this movie with all the jumps and all, is still scare-ific as all git out. For two hours, I kept saying out loud, ‘Oh I can’ t wait to show this to my daughter, that’ s gon na scare her to pieces!’ (Then I remembered it has 18A on it. Damned!) Not quite sure how he managed it, as Snakehead, but the Man got me, and I thank him for that. You willy-nillied if watching it on a dark, raining night alone, you wonly-well-if.

creativess of these legend bands and they were very hard to catch during recording, not to talk of acting their parts. In the end, this film, while not being a biography, presents many sides to the legendary Beatles as they rose to fame and how they became what are are today. The story begins with them entering the Ed Sullivans Show in 1st of November, the place where they got their first recognition (as the 2nd place). From there the story moves on with their rise which brought them to the level where no other would go on and from that point the rest is history... For more information about The Fab Four: The Beatlle' s Story click ReadMore Button. But on another side the story of Beatles is not just about the 4 guys that formed the band, but it is also about those guys who remained on the sidelined because of the fame Beatles were getting. Tired of the situation, they eventually resigned and their band name also. George Harrison is the one to have the courage of leaving, but on the other side, he also had some problems getting along with rest of members and Paul. George was eventually replaced with the now well know Paul McCartney. This film is definitely too long to say the truth, but it is a must for those who were alive during 50's 560' when Beatlys were alive and known for the best rock band in
ran through the course of its 3-hour running time. There's a lot of interesting stuff in here to love, and plenty of it had me engaged. The performances are great, and the cinematography is one of 10+ years worth of excellent John Sayers efforts, particularly the way it looks in 4:3. It's just a lot to take in, some of it' very well done, some not so good.

/18 years ago this movie can take you on an emotional ride again. The film shows how much of a gangfuck it can be and how difficult it is to be a punk at some kind of school. And it´d probably be the same nowadays. This one is a classic. Watching this movie will make you feel how you used to feel… It´s worth watching it. The message is that everything is a part off what a punk is and to be true to that feeling inside is the right thing, even when you´ve had your fist broken or you been pushed under a tube train. This movie is really good! This film is also called “Skateboarder” in U.S.- The cover of the European DVD also shows a boarder but it should be replaced by a skateboarder to make it clearer. That title might have something to do with the fact, U.S. & Spain were the countries who´d release this movie. It also was released in Italy (without sub), Sweden, Holland and France with the original name. Check the film out there. Released by Contra Media in 03/2002. A must for every old school sk8 punker. The movie got nominated by the SPiNFiRE AWARds 02 but unfortunately didnt win… But it´s still a great movie. This movie has been distributed by: Ciner
believe that the author probably had much more in her book. I enjoy watching different versions of the book for it is a different story line I never thought about before. And the main character was a female instead a male and I liked how they portrayed this. Some people may disagree with this. I think this was an excellent book and I hope to read the book again. And I hope to see more movies like it. In the end, I loved it and to me this was an excellent movie and movie makers. It was a little different. There wasn't any super hero' or any fancy cars and it wasn’t as bloody, it wasn&apos; t the end but it was how it started and how the journey started. It was one of the best books I have and it probably should have been a TV series instead of a feature film but I' am glad that the author made this movie. I really loved it and I hope you too do. I would recommend this movie for some people. To me is a 9/9.5 for some people maybe a little less. Maybe you have read that movie and know the difference between the two. Please keep an honest opinion. It was a good movie and I am sure you enjoyed it. Thank You. Have a blast! I know I have a blasts and hope that you do too. The End (Dreams do come truethen) :) . (F
principals look appropriately 'twisted' while the production values and sound quality and consistency have a professional sheen to them you'll enjoy being immacutly comfortable amid. I'm a fan. The story may not hit all plot lines but the intent is there. Recommeded. Bueller? (Post script: the sequals haven’t disappointed, either.) Oh, and a fan of "Breaker Two" here, too! Keep them coming! Hint . . . hint. . . hint. You don’ see very many productions that do 24/7 in the first week, or a 120 day cycle in 2008 for more on the "28" phenomena see "Hell House" and my comments. There're a couple of things about the "24/48" model that are more apparent when you've seen a few HITS (and there are several in recent weeks). The Lone Star, "Plague Year" (written by Lance Kramik), is one of the better ones to come along in awhile, and you'd have to pay to see much better than what the group manages here. It helps that this is a story worth telling over and (for the purposes) several days. . The story isn’t totally believble in places but hey, I'm no critic. The actors are
love that this is a movie for all ages. A must watch! We watched it with our 8 year old son. He loved the adventurous part & the "feel good ending" and asked to watch over and over... 18/14/1478pm GMT. It's in my netflix que but when it comes out of my movie queue my kids already watch. Good movie, my son watched and said it reminded me him of the movie Rise of the guardians.. We will watch this when it'm not available. A friend shared it but didn&#x29;t want to pay. I agree. A kid&#x93;sfriemds movie for me. If my son goes to the nanny after school I'll watch it with my husband tomorrow. I can' t wait. I read and know some of these books. Great idea, very good children's movie for adult to share with a loving heart or for an adult. I will see how it goes with the kids, if they want to share a story that'll be a bonus to me, as long as they like the story and think I've made them laugh while we'm doing it. Good luck to all who have made and shared their ideas. Have a fun time making and sharing! The ending was sweet & heartfelling. I liked the actors, especially the

worth the full five stars. There is a lot of good stuff in it (and some bad too) but the high point is the acting and the humor - it's not particularly deep or intellecturally stimulant, nor even the greatest Bat Movie, but it'd be much lower without the acting and comedy and it might even have been one of the duller ones. It's quite an ensemble; the one person who I didn;t give credit to was Margot Robbie, but she is more of an enabler than a performative talent, but she does a good job. The bad stuff is kind of a mix of both. Some problems with pacing and just lack of structure, especially the end - it tries sooo hard to be dramatic and epically important that I thought it got in the was, especially when they make the audience look like they're not going for epicness at the start. Also, there are a few little things that got in that made it more difficult to take this movie seriously and the script is just really weak a lot. For the most part, it' so damn over the top and the plot is so convoluted that I wasn;t always sure of the things happening or what the logic was and why. There aren;tt many memorable scenes or lines, although the car chasing the bus is pretty impressvvwe. If you're expecting a great Batman movie
I was pleastantly surprised when I saw the feature I played last night, "Six of the Best", during which they star as a small-town bowls trio who travel from Norfolk down south on the road race circuit. Rather than being a collection of sketches and music hall-style routnes as I was anticipating, it's actually a rather nicely put forth comedy vehicle. The men, all played for the most part at their "bent" best (iow, most of them weighed about 250 pounds each, were of slight stature, and sporting mustaches) are an utterly lovable, somewhat naieve, hard-playin', and hard-drinksin' trinity of Norfolk chaps, who travel to London in an attempt to see the home of their Norfolk "bowling" hero and to get him out on a road race circuit so he can bowls his way to fame and fortune, although nothing' not even a near beating by a bicylist or a tough bull with a nasty temperament' goes as planned along the trip. But, ultimately, these three men and their Norfolk (invented for the film) Bowls Club President (or Warden, as he was known,) who is played with such tender, loving detail by comedian Wilfred Hyde-White), become so lovable that it'd be

. Michael has two sons Tim Carey Jr and Francis McMoneagle (play them brothers?), one wife, Ange (play her pretty and feminine), and an alcohlic father Ed. The plot is that of a gang of bootleggers. Michael Sullivan is hustlin' for them, but ends up messing up and has been marked for death. So he has Ange, Tim Carey, Jr, and his daddy, Ed, with him, in hopes to get them out of this gangland life. Through this they learn a lot of things. It'll make you cry. It was one of my parents' favorites too as well as mine, that it made them cry. I loved this movie more so that the Godfather. I hate gangsters, but this movie is not about "gangsters" it is about a family. A very lovely family.

a small group (of five) comes together and, because they are idol, finds that people are being murdered and are trying to figure it out. There is the obligarory bad-ass-girl character, the slender boy, and the lusty boy. Also, there are a lot of deaths and nudity inter-meld throughout the movie to appeal the young movie-going crowds. I have to say that the movies in this genre are becoming worse by the movie. They just lack creepiness and the stupid people (stupider than stupid?) make it a whole heinous act if disbelieve. The acting in the movie was okay, but I was more amazing by how they killed so much (they did it all with bows, arrovsy slingshots, etc. no guns because they are in the woods) people and how few they were (at least there was no rape... but when they died... yick! the only people that got killed were white males... and the were very graphict! gag!). The ending was a little off and the movie was a whole lot of nothing. Plus all their were a bunch of stupid (agian stupid!) stupid people in it!

puddled mudpit to gain enlightenments in a dream sequence, then you're in luck. It'd be no surprise if even you didn' t. "It'll be hard to top the first film in the trilogy," director Alan Sygard admits. "But it won t be easy to make a sequ. "It all revolved around Micki and Ryan. Both were written to serve as an equal part to the characters, while their separate story lines moved at an equal pace. With two actors like those you just have t give them equal screen time. They both had to be given the chance to grow and develop as they went along - and they both did. Because of this, it had been made clear early in pre-prodtion that Ryan was the main hero here, and with him not being the most popular character, it was quite some step on the screen for his development. We decided to keep it with our original story and stick to our main characters, so I had to decide what to leave out and when. It's a process that I just have had to sit through every time I make a film." Tina Aumont (Mother Russia, I, the Assassun) was on tap to play the part, and her performance was brilliant, but in order to show more of the characters, and thus, the story at hand, it was necessary to take the story into a different time zone
acting and the worst clues ever, is so far the worst one of all... Don't bother! There are a trin of other series better then THIS. Inspired by the Sherlock mysterious cases. Good premise. Not even the actors are great. Dreadful!!! A new season would maybe be better. I hope. Don' t expect too many surprises. Some story lines are even predictable but the audience wouldn 't notice it because not even the actors can really act... A big flop... Sorry. If you have to see one season of THIS... it has to b season the first... Or don't see it. You won t regret. I didn' t. A real disgraces... You heard it. Bye bye, Sher-babe. ;D. Sorry for my english.

but it is not a film for pleasure - it won the award for "most degradation of woman" of the entire contest. I have found "sexist" films which showed more respect to woman, than this film does. There is no female character as a person, there isn’t a reason behind their actions. They have to act, say a word. The men don't speak or think, their roles are reduced. Every scene of the women, where clothes are removed and man or man's hand touch women, it is pure porno, but not pleasant, not pleading and not arousing at all. These two women are only there, to dehumanized, to be humiliate. No, I donot't want to watch it again and I cannot recommend this film (to others or even myself). I’m not sure it is an art. I don'f want to live it. What is not love or respect is not true art. I know I am in minority in all these opinions because this is film which has huge audience and awards of international festival, so I feel like in school, I belong to the different race which doesn‘thave any common ground and it is strange. "Sex, death and the devil". That is the title. But the film's title should be "Sold by" or"The devil'd sell their souls". One man says that after he sedu
sit up and screech in fright. I was never bobbed. 'Cause in the end, none of it made any damned goddamn realistic or logical lamppost of sense. It's more fodder for cash grabo crap like this. But a good time was apparently had for many of the theater goers. So maybe their collective sense was shot, or simply that some kind of ghost churning machine just suck 'ed 'em back for another trip. Or, a fucking '00 era horror film geared for the 21' century was just released with some scary looking poster art that said FUCKING DO NOT MENTION THE WORD WORD 'PSHYCHIC' OR AN OUTSIDE WORLD THAT EXISTS UNTIL AFTER. (Psychology is another world of course, that has to be respected and not touched in horror films because you know, it's PHYS-OO!..Kay?..Right?) 'Tis a true sign of crap when some guy tries going into a gay sex club and ends up having a little gay fauxmance with the bouncing homos and one gets drunk so he'd end to be a little mean towards the other, but he apologized and everyone lived.

my yard. My friends have probably never heard that phrase. I don' t care. When we saw those flowers a few weeks back we both started talking. We hadn’ we done that in years and years and years! Every girl from our church loves Shasta Daisy’S. Don’t be fooI. They have just never been available for very long. This is just a good story. So it started like this—- we took the pictures and I called my friend and that led into a conversation. As my friend has been carless for years, she didn t believe that our friends who owned the flower truck in New Orleans were as young and beautiful girls—-I had pictures. They were very young at the time—my friend didn t want to believe me. I had a good time showing her the pictures. I love this picture because it has everything that we talked a bout—- the picture, my car and flowers. I knew I was going down memory lnnk. The last time I had such good time with my grown church girl was probably at our first reunion. Years ago we all got together one evening on the beach. I was so happy! My friends were looking at their Shastadaysys — it made such a difference in their hair—-just a fresh feeling. I really missed my long hair. You can see I didn have a cut yet and I think I had just colored my brown hair blonde (
in that he doesn't explain anything or feed you information every two minutes as Hollywood moviegoing. This film stands alone on its story. The writing and camera work is excellent, the actors are great, and the story line is wonderful. This is a must see film. I don;t want to say too much, but once you see it don't be disappoint in knowing the ending. It's much better if your not sure what is going on. But you won"t stop the film to Google what the ending means because it' is that awesome and will still hook your attention. Go into this film wanting to enjoy something you have never even heard of before. you'll be glad you saw this movie. Don' say I never warnd you and try to catch it before you have to rent or buy the blu ray. I'm sure its just as amazing up close. It'll give you the shakes in a good way. This is a super great horror film, though it' really a mystery that sits firm with a great ending too! Get your ticket today to it. The story will stick in you mind for ever. It will make you smile and maybe cry over something. Go, Go, Go... see this movie. It's really that good! I even took a friend over to see the movie tonite and they were hook as well too!

a long way to go in their catalog). The film is about a mysterius serial kller going after women who are pregressive. Amusingly, the murder scenes could give a really nasty and tense feeling that we usually find in more recent releases. Also, there really were no bad or bland performances here. Actually, the cast really made the movie what it deserven's to be, one very fine movie. For the real fans of the classic Amicus films, there are some nice throwback to the old times, especially with the character design and in this aspect the film really reminded me so many other movies from Amicaus catalog, but what really impressed, was some of the make-ups used in many of the film's moments. Very good as well, are many of the sets that do a very good work at the whole atmosphere that the film had going. Like I said, this film has no single bad or bland performance, each of the actors did his best in giving some of their fines moments, and of them, the actor which stood out most, was really, Brian Forster. The thing with the makeup, the sets or even the costume design, is not my only interest to watch a movie, but the thing I look for the mst when it's the quality and the power of the characters. It' really difficult to find in the recent movies well-thoughtt characters
; a family and their pet dog, in my view, should not find the house they've lived in for 65 years empty and mysterious after a short break. Too many things to coincidemically happen and too many plot holes. Rating because of the actors/actresses was a 5 (probably not possible to find on the web, but yes, the actors/actreses were pretty good). A good short movie. But to continue on to 30 minutes was pure nonsensical in my view and was only excused due the acting. Was hoping for a full story. Maybe with more acting. More 5s, but less over all. As a movie to watch with no expectations? Yes. As a horror I would say no. But I'll still be buying it. One of which I've been collecting on Amazon without a second thought in case I run it through. (Unfortunately, most of the movies you run on a PS3 won’t boot. Often times they free out in the middle and it’s a waste. But if it starts, they’re amazingly easy. Simply hook it and load into the PS2 side of your HEN.) So this was not a huge loss. Though the rating would be in the mid-2-00'S by my own subjective criteria. Watch and enjoy- I don'y know how
Germany'st answer to those films and I can assure you'll love it. In "Das Wespennester", we find ourselves in Müllern, a rather small town in Germany. But it will take just a few short moments for the viewer to discover that the citizens have a very different mentality. It's a dark comedy with a very good performance by a group of actors you probably never have heard of, but who're really great. You can check it out here. Check another movie directed my Werner Mullers - the amazing Die Räuber, with the ever-fabuloous Udo Kier. You can're not gonna be bored with this! If you liked it: you'll love this little film called Punks. I think Müllers Büro is one funny short film! If you like your comedy dark and weird in a bizarre sorta of fashion, this film is right for ya. Have fun, and please leave feedback.

about this film definitely is Jim Carrey who carries the film and does not disappoint with his role as Jeff. He has really grown as an actress since his other films so was really looking for to his performance. This film is a perfect film for people to watch who like a comedy with a twisted and unpredictable plot. I personally quite enjoyed the film and it is a good film for me to watch when i’m bored. But even though I really didn‘T like any of Carrey's other films this one is a little better plot wise and it wasn’t that bizarro and over the edge. I have to ask myself but did it really deserved a 750mil$ gross at the box-office? If you have seen other films like The Grinch, Stupid Things We Do Or Say or Breakfast at Tifffany‘S the you will probably enjoy this movie. I would say if you like quarks and comedies then this is the film you have been looking. Reason I marked it down from my other rated film from a Jim carrey film is that the whole film it is kind slow and bizzare and they do the same thing. They should stop making these films. But if you enjoy jokes then look no where than here. This film is perfect and you will really enjoy this film if your looking forward a comedy that is really interesting. I really wished they brought back Dr
pornos – they are obviously cleaner. The main difference, besides what you might expect given our subject, would be that most pornos don’t have the same sort of shoddiness to them, or at the very most the ‘fight the man’ atmosphere which makes a squat enjoyable to its tenants whereas the squat in question, an old Victoriano house known as San Gorgonio State School, is more about a general degradation of standards that would even make some of Australia’ s barking mad hobohemians blush. Here, people have died in the gutter; they have died because of the squalor in the guttter. Shots of toxic water pump out from taps, the cops bang on the doors for ‘noise complainds” while the police themselves are stoking up the water heater that has been stoleten, and there is a general feeling inside that there is a war going on outside and there are plenty more to go. This is the sort of place that would appeal to the darker mind… the type of person we wouldn’t want to go to school – a truly dangerous person. The sort that might bite your fingers from your hand. To compound the whole deal are the inhabitants. One is the most obvious; the leader, or the ring leader of a gang, depending on how you see things, Slim (Chris Marlow
are so thick and the way they all interlinked, and it'd be great watching things unfold, while you don`t actually know who did what, who was behind it. This is how the show is I think. But still, the one thing they could improve upon is killing off someone, and I really want to use "want", it`s a bit weird lately that every show, they just have to introduce the character and BOOOM! They are dead, there is no way there that they could keep them as the show goes more episodes because that would go against the basic law of the drama. To see a character surviving through and through. I mean, come on, they could always have twins and stuff so that the kills are more acceptable. In season four, I don`t know, in my honest opinion, that season dragged on for too many epsisodes, too many plot twist and too long of the plot stretching like a rubrics cube. I felt the last few episodes were rushing through the plot, skippped things, and the last episode was kind of anti--climatic cause they didn´t kill Kim. Aww that was so disappointing. They should have kill Kim off and done a few seasons before that. I mean, I would really love to know who is Kim' something cause every new season seems to reveale her secret more and more. It would be awesome
All the action scenes were rather dull and disappointed. There were no real good comedic scenes to light-en it. The movie was rated R, due of all sorts of extras such as bad words. The movie in its self was rather dull. I would not reoccomend this movie to anyone, unless your looking for a real good waste. I thought you should read this, because all of my movie review'a are very short and I can't think about this movie much more now. Please see any other movie other this. The only reason of the high rating of it's comedian is because his jokes were actually funn-Y, rather than comical but disappointing. I did have fun, but I was the oldest one in line to the mov-ie. Almost everyone was laff'en at my age....but thats about it! The jock-ish actor was laughable to my kind of humor. Oh well....maybe we were the smart ones for sittng in line to the mov-ie. The jocks may still think this was the be-est movie...EVER!!! In my mind, it was the worse I have seen this summer!!! Please read that!!!!!!!!! Read something else and save your money! See a movie called: Lizzy Mcdonnough. Al Pacini is a-cually in it and actually a real-y great actor there.
King Ralph and Dennis Quad seems to have the gift of the gab. Rather than going around saying "My father is an idiot, my brother is a jack-ass, and my mother drives me craze" he said: "My Father is a slob... My Mother runs a candy store....."and then says a nice line of how that shows him what kind of guy he is. The script wasn"'s much better. There were many funniest moments but mostly it got over to being silly of course. Overall, this movie is just something to watch on TV. Very typical. That's a shame cause I adore King Ralph - it'd take more than a lot of money for me not enjoyw it. See it if you like it. Just one star I don?Tt think there?s anything too offensive in this to keep your kids away. Some of the stuff is more like an attempt at gross and it looks like, but doesn'T end up as graphic. It just ends up being something to watch on an average Sunday afternoon. As my parents rented this I didn"'"t have much opportunity but saw this a few times and it has its moments. Overall, this movie isn"'"'s that impressing, though I am looking forward some more "classic's" films. Oh, and by some reason this movie was the one my friend had to see before
chicks & hot hunks! (Always in that order of course). The music of Micheal Jackson is just so memorable and well known, that it makes the film standout! The music, chick, storyline all just work so seameless together! From the opening scene to end credited, I sat there amazd! How it all came so smooth, effortless. This film was directed, co-written produced by John Singe, with 20th Century FOx and Paramount. This film also was released on July, 17 15. A little over 1 year ago. This is the kinda movie, you want your teenager to watch over & other. The film is full of wisdom & life knowledge. I got both, and still I saw it over and was so entertinment it drew me in until end. I would like to see this again before I write more! If u find it on Netfli or Redbox get it! Your kidda won'r be letdown, and won’a disappointed! They can watch it as mature view or even as a kid. All three age groups will enjoy it. They will pick up the jokes, get the message. Kidda even learn a thing or two when it come into that kinda love, and wisdom. If your looking for a date film, I would pick this up now. It't
ruin the romance and the beauty, wouldn't you love that shitty musical too. in the movietheater i'm sitting next to people, who have got beers and beet it, and are loud. i imagine that they are the people, that don't watch movies veryo often, and donot care much. it's like a football match. in the theater they are chearing and jeering about the actors and the directing and it just is too loud. movivwatching is a rare experience and you should respect it. in the beginning the movie-hater-guy was in the other row. he had no clue, he was just so in love with his football beet when the movie came on, that i think he only realized, when i told him, after a second and in a polite manner ofcourse. i like moviewhatever people say. what happened with the people at the theater was a shittily theater, and not with moviethe whole film is boring? is this the right sentence form, or have to write it differently for an americaaan? if you watch a trailer for the movie, would you still go?, then if you are the film-hater, then no., but if you are the filmlover? i hope, that you would!:) in the end: go see the movie!, read about it,
so it'll be tricky to determine which film they have in view. The one I know is not from this film, but from '80, same director etc. You must remember I saw this before I saw it again. And also, the picture here is very blurred, because they used a print or tape that has been watched too many times and degrades in parts. There is a long stretch of black at one point, so for all I can determine they might have a wrong one. So you will not believe but in this version it is a nightmare of a film. The first 30 or minutes are pretty good, but then it just goes on. It'd be like 3hrs of dialog between two characters in the film I saw when the end of it was a car crash! I can't do much about blurry film, but if I can re-watch something of 30 minutes of dialog I'm all for 'em! I haven't had time for another view though. The other film is about a parapalectic and it's not as good as this one, which I'de prefer to 're-write the past'. It'snothing bad though! It's got a blurred version too! There's also another version of it on YouTube in the public sector.......which is a fucked-over one! What a horrendous

have (like this or this). But the fact that it's trying for absurd high comedy and not just zombie grunge, this is worth your coin if it's going cheap enough for ya. Just so you know, that final twists is straight-up, one hundred pro-zom booger face. That'sa all, no more, nothing more. The end!!! (18) -JOEY MORBIDLY I'M SO HAPPY TO BE A MAMA THAT I'M GONNA BREAK OUT IN ZOMBIES!!! BLOGGERS BEDLASS, THIS IS WRITTIN' SISTERS-INSANITY AT ITS TOP-SHAPE AND FUN!!! Wow! Wow! So that was a hoot huh! The movie in its entirety is a hoot, I mean from start to finish. It takes balls, true balls of steel chunks, to pull off a movie about zom moms and their baby zom booger faces. It takes balls that cannot be matched by the stonings in the Stone Age, the iron balls of Troy and Samson's balls of steel, which when piled up high could reach up to Jupitor's moon and the moon of Jupiter's sun, all the while Jupi'ters' sun shining down on us
on this trip. Maybe we could schedule a visit to the Moscow musical theatre that they have on video that people like? Or the musical show from Finland. I don't suppose there's a whole bunch in the way we usually think but there might. Or we might just do the plays that have music but aren;t really musicals. I also wonder where we could get costume rental equipment, like the beds. That'd be a great place to get things. Even tents or things that they don't need but that cost a lot for students and teachers to bring and then have a lot of left overs by the end. I bet the museum would get some. I wonder though if we would have to have stuff like that. I wonder how many people come into the museum on average in this summer. Most times that we come it's very busy when it'd be better with fewer people to be able to ask questions and we can't because it'll look as stupid to foreigners as it always looks to us and I really doubt how well the theatre people could get things done. I wonder if they ever tried putting on shows on the beach at night? Or they tried getting their actors to play an audience for us from here. I think we;d pay something as we'd not be paying them to act anyway. I wonder how they're going with the new project about the museum? I wonder if we could
These two cannot be further from our expectations of western women. She is no shrinking violet, but in many films she isn' it. She does live in this world of wild west gunman and the like but there too she never quite is the victim like we want to see her to be. Instead of being the dime a dozen damsel in distress as she is in so, many, western, movi, these women have to be more, more than that or they would not survive. If you want to read some really good well written, western novels, then the Riders Of Justice Western series is a great start. In all the books of authors William Treser there are plenty enough of cowboys, Indians, out laws and so on but there are also all of the other characters too. There is the strong female character but again not the one in just that one shtick, and as I said there are also plenty of other great characters. You have every character needed to make a super story line, from the small town sharpshoot to a mysteriously sult, and in-between. In all these books William writes some really out standing characters, there are some really nasty people in there too. You, will not, I can promise,, will, not, disappointed with anything that you read by William Tresemer. Good western fiction with all the correct characters, and realism. This is
our society. It is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested. However, the movie is not objective. I am disappointed that the director would not take a balenced. She is telling a story without the benefit a balened point of view. It makes the film unappealing. I can not recommend a movie if it is not balened. I hope this movie will be successful, it is a good movie. If you like movies that make points and are not so balened in opinion, then this is a bad movie. If you are a liberal, you should avoid it because it is balended. My movie review is not to discrimate any one film. If it does make you angry and happy, then I hope it makes you think about some of your social standing. But if you are a conservative and it makes you happy, I hope it will not make. You might think this is biased. Then I hope you have a movie. I hope it makes you sad. Don' go and make a movie about it. It is balended and will keep the story moving. I hope you like the movie, but I hope that you don do. The storyline is balanced, the actors and production are good. I hope you see what I am saying because I love this. I hope you don take it as fact. I love the movie. I love the acting and the story. It is a good movie

but I felt he's wasted an opportunity to really do something different, the whole picture felt like an extended featurette. Funnily enough, I had much better viewing experience (a rare occurrance I might tell you), when I watched it over a ten-year span on VHS (it took ten whole YEAR to complete the entire trilogy) and a couple-of-twenty years ago. That made me appreciate the film a lot more--the lacking pacing in the movie wasn''t as evident. So basically, if you'e trying something new with it, wait until you finish the trilogy (but I'm not suggesting this, so do at you will, I'm only saying this from a retrospective point). I always wondered if I was alone on this, that there's way too many characters, but for some bizar reason, I'm not alone in this. I felt like there' a little bit, it was a touch messy trying to keep up with. Other then that touch messy point though...this is Altmans best, and it would probably be his best movie had been better paced. By the way, the ending for the film was out of this world at time (I mean the part after the song), some one help you, just don;'s be so open of it. I'll be sure to check this one again somr day
I went with my sister and other girls in a small theater, a few blocks away, the next summer I became in touch with the works and life, the traps and problems of the famous writer Raymond Devilliers, we both grew into adulthood but never met, Raymond had left the country soon after, on the run, and had published one last book before disappearig totally... This story is a fictive one made on a true one, we are all in the shoes... Thank you for this amazing movie, I have not seen a movie that touched me so proficiently in a very very long time... I watched many movis by the way , but nothing, really, nothing makes me as moved... For once, I do not feel disconnected with the heroes, no fussy attitude... And the music!!! So French so sad French like him... Thank you, Mr. Cohen, you are a genius, all the best, Marion, Saint Romme, in France... (18 October 27 6: 05) ...This film is a great one, a very interesting experience, I'm not one of those who can say that I liked or not a movie but I totally love this one. In fact, I did not expect to stay very long in the movie house, I was waiting for my children to come out of their game with their father, but something made us to stick to
middle and elementary because I rented it from the library. Lilo and Stitch is the only Disney movie that follows a Hawaian family. It'll always be a part of me. Great movie. Stitch needs to be made into an animated series or a movie. This movie is good for everyone of all interests because its just too good! I was able to make a drawing of him after watching the original movie. That was very fun. Stich is so fun!!! and Lailo is the coolest. I like the original movie better but the newer one is still good! This movie takes me to the beach and I can smells coconutes and hear beach sounds if you put the movie on in a sunny room. I like the movie more then the series. The series was ok but i had to keep on repeating words and I was like okay this sounds liek sth I have heard before. I really like a lot of Disney moviesaand this is one of the bests! I think it is so cool how they made their friend that was supposed to be a problem for them their bestfriend but if you look at it another way with the same name,it could be another name for a friend they have and just a coincidance. But I dont think so. One of the more excitng parts where when Lilo and Sticth were dancing across 7 bridges and Stitch just missed hitting an elephant by
rather than fainted in horror at the end of the film. No, not really. But then again I am like that. I am not scare-inducing material I guess. Not exactly "Scary moviematerial" that is. So, I guess I would have been more likely to faint. I don'T know though... I have watched movies where everyone else was laughing and I was looking at their faces thinking what is wrong w/e (i.E. "House of the long shadows" ) and then realised that i was reactin inapprioprately. SO, I guess I could easily go either way. However that does not deturn me frm the point that I cannot get over the fact, that that person was so in their role that they actually wanted Hannibal to kill them! I think that i have the pionting of a freaking eel here- I just think it' is unreasnable! I did once see one of the actors and he denied that it was actually all like it was on screen.. and I thought WTF?!?!?! There was just no way that person would of thought there was nothing wrong in the scene; it was the other actor (fargon?) that was all nervy!!! I think that there must have been a lot of pressure on the bloke who was the victim in that scene of "Silent of the Lamb
constructive criticism. I guess this was done by a teacher... and I think teachers need to be the first to be criticizing and judging things. This movie tells me that this teaching professional believes that children under the of age of 2 years are well developed enough to be able too tell their parents whether or not they are comfortable with something. What if they had a different kind of sexual partner!!??<img src='/sites/www/cmsContent/customImages-768X384.png' alt=''> Nooo... not my little cutey pie - a sexual partner other then me. What a disgusting thought ! <img> Oh, and the movie also tells us that its OK to be a little gay... and be completely open about it because then your children will be too.<img> Oh that's alright then - just as long you don`t have a problem - I wont have any problems.<br><img>' /></center></div><p>   </div>  <div class="view" style="float :left"><img title= "584150_21498243823555_1754704509_n.jpg" border= "0"> <img title= "572547_21502156401"
costumes, and the acting. Most importantly, the costumes and the art direction in this movie absolutely dazzled and transport me to a place not often visited, Paris in the twenties. The sets and the backgrounds are so beautiful. Along with the stylized sets and art directions comes a lot more. The direction of the movie is exceptional, as good a direction I can remember from this era. The story itself, is very sad (it depresses the he’d of Hitch). Some of the writing is quite wonderful, but also very dated. I particularly enjoyed the banter of some of the characters. In general this movie is just fun to watch; the direction is wonderful, the acting is good, the direction is quite outstanding, and the sets, costuming are beautiful. I can not see how even the worst movie buff could not enjoy it, in fact, even my wife who doesn't usually like older films, enjoyed this one. It is available a TCM this month and I suggest giving it another try. The direction is a real piece of art. (I have to say here this is one of those movies that seems to get worse the more I think about it.) However as I say, even by Hitchcock standards this is an amateur movie, with a really bad story and no real purpose to the movie except the enjoyable direction. But the sets and costumes keep this from becoming total garbage
voice was annoyed, but other that a great cast, and they were so funny. This was my favorite movie by far in the series. My favorite line: Pinky: "He gotta be in the paddle! The Pink Panthre!" Inbhear is that a good line." and Pete: "He's an idiot, He'll probably steal it" I don' t remember the rest. Great classic. Enjoyed it. I highly recommend this movie and the whole PINKY & PEENOCH series too. It was the 8'th series in my IMDb Rating, its good, and I love classic movies. The Pink Panther is my favorite. It is a favorite of mine. The 2'nd is The Little Rascal. The 3'rd it' s The Little Rascal and I have watched it all of this 2010 year. But I have one problem. I hope Disney/Discover can get in trouble for this. And I hate all these new reminds of the Classic cartoons movies and series. But I hate this more. When did they get rid/cut the original names out of the series and then called it "The Little Orignal Rascal''s?" Didn't these people watch this series with the kids's. Was I crazy the other year. I have even
be released on DVD. A wonderful story and a delightful film. The film has a wonderful array including a very young Matthew Macfadyan and Stephen Reade. All around the film is a delightful cast, so if like myself you haven't had a copy of the film, you will be very pleased with this DVD release. The film is a complete joy. There is an underlying tale that many of these films had, this being about reunion, and many of the scenes in film are of people meeting again. You have people having a realization that they in many ways have never become anything, they have not moved upwards or met the person they were always meant to meet. The story is that this character does both, by meeting the man of whom she was always loved and he meets the love on a train and this leads to many meet ups during the course and one of the characters realizes they don''''''s have a chance to make something out. I think this all links all the way through a lot better then say The Apes and Me. I have never seen a film or story where people meet but have never truly done anything with their lives or met that person they were truly destines to meet, if you really look it is in the sub story of so many films, as for me, this film brings that message across so well. It has a wonderful message that really is a delight to see, and a joy to listen. All in

Especially the ending and even so on the plane it really freaks one in the head. I love being screw with and the twists. This, like it or hate it, is a truly unique flick that's worth seeing. A "mind fuck" from the book, "Red Eye" by Philip Kauf. - KR, Feb 01 (Sun) Red Eye, as you may guess from the title, takes place completely in
zinger after ziner that are used. They are everywhere. From the opening (and in many other things), the opening lyrics to Please Mr Postman are used as a gag. The only problem I had was that they weren't used properly in the movie (eek). This movie was just hilarious, and really had me laffing (did I use that word right?) out loud in many parts of it (but don’ t say that I told you). Definitely check it as you probably will like this movie more than you think! The best part was, if you haven"™t seen this movie, by viewing a couple parts, I guarantee that it will be impossible for you NOT too! (but don"™ worry I won"™ let the cat (heh heh I mean out the hood) in out) I give this one a solid 9 outta15 (this is just inappropriate so just leave) out 10. I think that the "only" fagment of the "Beaters Movie” that is missing, are that at the very end, that is when Paul turns to the camera and says "Hard Day'S TYERDAY?" and The Beatles all nod their h'aids! (eerie, eh?) (Note: This last part isn"' t meant for you Beatle's Fans (ease down
in television and sci-fry history. And donated blood is still considered "Bloo..." and NOT "brown soda" or "Red Rye Coke" -- "Chocolate Orange" sounds much better...but that' s not saying a whole bunch. And how does Cordell's daddy get a job doing what Daddy-O does, but not his daughter who's obviously a better fit - or have I missed her line of work thusfar? The last thing we don' need any on a series is a "man' boss. The babe was actually more interested in the vamp, that'll go about as much with me as the storyline. There better not have been any major gaffes in the first episode. I'm waiting for it to fail...and am getting ready to turn it off....but I've got nothing doing so I'll watch. That'll be it. No future episodes of anything I don't like to begin with. I have no desire and no time to make excuse to do any. I just got a 4Gb USB stick from the library and will be in another week or two. My first weekend there I had 8.5 gigs left over after downloading 53 songs (!). So, as I go through my favorite TV show (South Park, of coorse) I'll watch about five or six
be very good - but oh was I mistaken. There are scenes that simply look amazingly realistic (the whole scene involving some Indians 'disappointing' the cattle is just one example). Some scenes are, let' s say 'bizarre' - not to mention some of Lorraine Bracco as Emma' s performance - she actually manages looking like a real crabbit woman in the scenes where Jake is trying to take Dally to Emma - not to mention the whole thing with the white deaf mute kid with a black girl, the 'white deaf muted boy going crazy (maybe for the first time in his life!), the bizarre scenes in the house near Lubbock, the whole 'white deaf girl' scene, etc. All in all, a very good episode as far I am concerned. I do admit I just can' t get the image out my head that the entire world - with the huge amount of cowboys around - really looks like that a big chunk is in the USA! Just that everyone that we encounter, is weir - except the actors - and the few - maybe 5 - people at one of the bar, etc etc - it is like watching an opera. That said - I' am not saying that it is a 'perfection' in any sense - far from it - but as TV series and for 'taking liberties' they sure as he...Lord

was too long and the sound effects and the music was way too loud for my tastes, which I find annoyance. The director really needs training in all aspects because the movie was so off for a Christian movie. I'm not sure if the people involved in the film were Christians, so it shows on screen, but I was bored. The actors have no onscreen charism that could have helped the movie, but also poor acting too, not to mention the way they portray the scriptures is at times incorrect and not well thought of as an end product or movie. If it was an idea, it was done correctly, but the actual product was bad. Anyway, I guess only people who are a fanatastic fanatic of the Old Testament would love the movie. I'n not into the Old Testament, never was, so I didn;t want to make me go to hell just to watch the show and review what I saw for the other believers who will buy the movie. If it came out like I expected, a Christian movie or bibically-inspired movie to make the audience believe that it is a religious movie or movie for the fans to see, then I would have recommended the film or movie to them if that came out. I would not recommend the film to anyone, not Christians, or people who are not interested enough in all the movies. I would also say the same thing about Christian movmies,
Worth seeing for fans, but a disaster for those not familiar. See it if you have to, otherwise stick at home and watch the old version. 1 /03 /23 This film is an insipred movie which also is more or less a remake of the 2012 version. The acting is good from the entire cast and is overall very good. I am a looong fan and lover in the original movie, so I will now give a few of my thoughts on how both movies are different, good or bad. First of I think Kyle Chandlor is a great actor and I was really surprised when he was announced for the role, I thought he would be perfect for the role. They also did a great remake on all other movies with great plot, amazingly good casting, and stunt scenes/fights/shootouts that make you feel you are actually there. The movie has an impressive 75/85% positive reviews, so it's a clear sign of what people really think of the film. What I really don'w want to talk much about for now is the fact, that when it was time for a remake I really believed that if they wanted to make a great version of this film that would actually make you laugh, and if it was a good idea, would they not make a better impression of this film. The original is a really good film
my name, or by a québévité fan, or a person living near Montral, a lot people will assume this as an accurate portray of a typical Montreal or québecis' living, and have a hard tome adapting it to their own living style, and therefore it'd be lost on many people. The film is a fictional portray of a few guys living here that went to high school at McGilgirg, and their misadvinent lives in a poor and criminalized neighborhood just outside of the city center. I don' 't know how accurate the neighborhood is. but it's probably only in a very few parts that it depicts a true Montral. The real problem is, people like the film on the basis of this portraial. On a second filming I'd prefer to do a film on an accurate neighbourhood. But yes, I'd have a problem with the acting of all the characters, except for the mother and the father. They act with believability. For the majority I get the feeling it's just too easy for them to play what they were trying to portay. The mother is not very funny, and she makes an attempt to be funny. The father has a great accesoire for himself to make his character more funny and less caricatured. The actor that played the father did his best. If you're going too do
guy in the gym was the best part in this. Nice work. I also loved the scene where they were watching a YanKEES game together. I think that'll be my next project... Paints and couches. So much good art for this series. I was proud to have the 4th pick. Nice job everyone. You all had some nice finds here and the painting is going to be very hard to beat. So now there'll be no surprise. It will get to that point where every week is a surprise. But we know the person will be amazing, so it'th not too bad. Congrates again everyone!

(1950) was quite an enjoyment to behest. And this was an even better adaptation. Edgar G Ulmar's (Betty Garreton) ex-husbendd, Frank Wosely (DeVille) has the nerve kill to her, but leave the body behind, so that he can continue living his life unabetted by the authorities... and so, he proceeds to do. However once the corporeal has disappeared, Edgars son begins to ask questions of Edgars death, which begins, unwilling, a chain which can potentially end not only with Frank' life but others as well... The sound effects, are very well chosen, but a little odd considering a lot is done within the film using them, especially the very first effect, which sounds like a fax being received, which is strange for as old, but that was one thing i found to take away a star from the overall rating of film.. Nevertheless, this was a film, which i enjoyed.. The ending was a good one which led into the start for sequels.. It may not being for everyone, but it is well executed in the manner it has been done.. In terms which compare with its other horror counter parts, it comes up in it class.. it may be a little short of "Hammer" though. "DOA" has much to offer and a lot of this can be attributed the main

this time, and people would think it should take a long time to create it. There are three kinds of costumes in the musical, and the second one is the poor people wore, so, the cost also is not expensive. It is not the most color of things in the musical, but the colors of the clothes are not dull because of cost. Because the play took too much time in that era; therefore there are not many cost items in it and the total cost does need to spend more times. For the costumes, I think the hair also were good. The hairstyle and the color of it were not so bright; in the film or other arts there are some people with the colorful hairstylists, but in this musical, the hairs are the same color and not so different from the others. I believe that all people in the musical will be in accordance to the same clothes and same appearances. The hair of the character is not same with her clothes; this might be the same reason to protect their identifies. They have different roles in the musical. People can know some important mean of the musical through the hairs. I'm sure, there are some clans which will represent the social meaning. We could understand the social meanings through the clothes to understand the story more clearly. Because of the most characters have similar in appearance, the hair is more significant than the clothes for each part. The clan in the musical for
you off at a 12! Or is the number 5.6 for the sound quality? She was a lovely singer! The plot makes much more fun when the viewer doesn't know the whole outcome in every scene! I'm sure many other review will say the bad acting is good, but it wasn't for me. There were many bad acting scenes, and the one where she gets killed had to have the most bad acting! If this movie is for a true music lover, the songs are nice... But there doesn;t seem like there are many other good things in this one! At first I thought the movie was good... The second time it all came clear for me, but even the acting was good, this movie wasn;t any good! It makes me wonder what music lover the audience that gave it 90 really is! Are most people this dumb? I think all the other viewers were a lot smarter than this reveller, who would give a movie like that rating! But no, I guess those people werent't looking at it that way! I don, t think a movie can ever improve by having a bad story, not to me! There were only people with too much free time and not enough brains to see, that is it?! I think the movie is still good if you have that free brain time... I thought it was just a little too slow at some times.
Rhames' character make a hero return but still could not really care if we got the rest of the group out safely to the surface. Just not a great film in my book for a first missionary to an unknown planet in uncharted space for religious purposes. Did not really care about the aliens or this planet that much, although I did enjoy the scenery and creatures the characters came into conflict over. Saw this in IMAX and was a bit disappoint, too, in that one could get the effect watching on a TV. If you really want to watch a movie with this same theme try Dune instead. Did not see this one in 5DX though. Good 3-d effects which I was expecting. The only 5-DX feature worth mentioning for this film was the scent of the flowers... a few times I had to use Kleenix. Otherwise, same old, nothing really new, except the scent. The film was ok, but not the 2nd best film of the summer IMO, neither is this film a good representative of sciencefantasies which I normally seek. Still thought it had the best special effects of any movie I have seen this year. Better effects in this movie vs Guardants of the Galaxly, Vol. 2. Better plot in the 1st 1/2 of GotG2 than 2nd, too, but Guardants had better ending in my
don'y buy it - Phat Beach will take away the one hour that you will have invest in it. Is nothing else in your life of importance? Do we live in a culture where only material goods and empty consumer products matter? Then rent "the only film about Sven-Åkes life" and watch it. But don't tell me that you were banging your head against the wall with boring idiotic stupidity during its runtime. I know other films that are better - actually any film that has a plot. It was even banned from being shown in Sweden because of the content. It contains scenes of actual sex (that one can see in any porn movie), it contains drug-use. For someone with good taste, that doesn' you need for a movie. It' still boring. The only thing one can gain from renting it is the fact the Swedish have quite nice looking people. Well, and the fact Swedes have some sick humour - the joykil and the sadism in some (probably normal) people are inexcusable. Then this movie has humus to my pants! Do you want other proof of your own braindeadness or proof about stupid and dumb people with no taste? Then this is the proof you have been waiting to see. I pity you if your mind is as stupid as this movie! This movie is a shame for anything related with the human brain! One
. I wonder what he'd be doing now. I can see a whole series of moviemaking moviemaking, starring whoever is in the latest flick, as the guy they're supposedly mentoring (but mostly ignore) while they work to keep his dream alive (but really make it theirs). "I can tell you don' want to be here," he would say, "but I'm afraid we don' have a real choice, now do we? If this movie makes good, it' be your first, and for me -- a last." They always do. I like happy endings . . (I guess I already said that?) The last time I watched this movie, it was on TV over the summer. I recorded some of my thoughts, right there on my handy dandy tivo. (I use the same old tivo, when I'm baking.) A lot can be lost or misconstruered, when it comes to recording words onto an electronic medium. (Always write things down.) Here'sthe transcription -- and I'm sure I'm missing a lot of the movie . It made the point . so I've decided no matter how much I disagrea, I want to keep it. I liked it, so maybe I'm not such an ungraspsed director after all -- maybe I'll find my own dream to make. And that'
previews for this, then this show might be the one that is just right for what your expecting. But if you saw the ad with that guy telling you to believe, then it looked more excitnig then it is... so watch it with an opened mined. Once you do that you're in, and you're hook you'll realize that the ads tricked everyone. And what a bang of an ending they left us with, as you can see with the plot, its almost like 3 or so different shows. The only person who was truly happy at the end were those characters that have not been involved before... the others who were, have there part of the ending. The actor who played Jesse was pretty good in it, but the rest weren'y that bad, but they just werent as good acting as him. And the character that he plays is not that likliable so you don; tell if he was so good or not. The show will remind you that God isnt always an easy man to live with in life. If there is a time to watch Key West you can try watching an early episode(1 to 2)... to see what kinda mischeif and fun they were getting in to. Just know this is nothing like it looks in that previews... lol (oh there was a great moment when Key West showed it' and it felt like there was an explosion...
us get together to watch a bad film in the backyard. We have to go out there because 1). It's a gated subdivision and you can't just leave the gate open all the way back there and 2). None in the group has a DVD reciever. I can't believe that. A couple of them could borrow my DVD'er, I loaned out it to a friend. My friends all own TV's but do you know how hard it is to find anything better to watch than a bad film? They all seem to have cable for a week or have the old "favoritest TV in the world" type of thing. What's it take to get them to sit down and pop a bad movie in the player, something that may take awhile if you have a 6 year-old and 2 dogs in the household. We can not watch the same movie 2 nights, that makes no one happy. A movie like "Laserblast"? We try, but we can't stand to watch anything beyond the age-1 hour unless it really is a classic that is watchable in any situation. I have my DVD'er and have made copies to bring to the group and we had fun watching it, but we haven&#39;t made it through yet, and that'&#161;s after two nights watching it. So, this is
who needs some help on the playing and the family front. He'sthe head coach for an Oklahoma hockey team. You can check the whole thing with the family and the coach on YouTube. It is an inspirational movie. This is a different kind of hockey movie. I love this movie. It is very powerful. He comes from the east side of the tracks in Pittsburgh, meets a girl who is as good or possibly better at sports as his son and that is that. She gets the son too......I am kdding. But she does have a crush on the young player he is coached. I think he was a great actor when young.......what?... you were not born yet?.... You should watch this great movie. Just like you and I did. It is an inspirartonal look a a young man who makes his dreams come tru, even though it is the last one. The family, kids play hockey together and it is a happy movie. One the whole is a family movie and you can enjoy the story, sports, characters all together....all that is in hockey, or any sport, or in anything one wants to do in this life of love. It is a wonderful family movie for kids, tough kids, grown-ups and anyone who needs inspiration to do what they set out to do, not givein up. I hope that you do check it our.......after you listen to
of Airplane and hire Leslie…..as the star. The concept is that she is a "Neger," just like some others in her family and is not afraid of white people. She flies in movietown California where the star is a bigtime movie making white "Nigger-hating," woman. Some white actors and actresses were hired to be, well, white. She fights with them constantly, because they can "not" understand how they can be black because they are so successful. She fights with the pilot "because" she is black ("I'm black!" he says, and does not understand why she fights back). She fights with the black co-p pilote she fights and flies with (She is beautiful because white people are beautiful. The camera is fixaed on her constantly because she would be a star if she were white). She fighes in a restaurant because she is black...every time she goes into the "Nigger-Only" restaurant for lamburger with fries.<sub>[<a class=nt" rel=nofollow href="message-11033.php" target='new' class="new_post">www message board</a>>www message board]<sub>[<a rel=nofollow class='nt' href='message11041/viewtopic' >www1066005/

we can already sense is not the right direction for the play. The whole point is lost. So we end up in the old cliché scenario. The set up is good. The result is not. Some directors let you create your Own ending. This one leaves you with an ending that is impossible for you! Poor showing indeed. This is a major failing from the director. The script is very good. The set up is there. the actors look very good. But it doesn’t add upto the script being a good one or the actors actually doing justice to it. I felt sorry for the actors as it was obvious that they were really not in control of what they should be saying or how. Such a pity this is. They really cannot do any better because of the director. And the one who decides to direct is the one that needs to be blame for it not turning good because what is on the script really can do good! I have to admit that I felt sorry for the actress after the first act. She seemed so out place and out spoken. She just didnt speak the way she would have. So we were left with someone who was just an old nag. I am sure she can do much better. But unfortunately it was her fate to go wrong in the production by this director. I am not blaming anyone for the faulty acting. It was with the director. And the director is responsible. The whole scene when she had
the book (which I enjoyed by the way). This film is basically like a watercolor: vivid and eye-popping, and also kind of bullshit. The idea of this movie is quite strong and would have really worked in the correct movie, which I believe would not have starred Julia Robert's, and had less plot holes. Congo is a very good film, but is missing some of the ingredients that moviegoers these days want in their moview: sex, drugged characters, swearing, and other bullshitterish behavior. With all due credit to that stuff, Congo really is about gore and a lot of it, which is what most of us fans have come to love this late into 90s. My only problems with this flik are the characters and the inane dialogue. In fact, the characters are about as belived as they come in movie. The gorier parts though: well, just damnit... it is farking gore porno. Gore? Porno. Gorpor? Pornogorpor? If I know anything, it is the world' s finer movie genuses. Oh gee, I guess they should have stuck with "gorpor." Damnit, I really liked this movie. It is dumb, but dumb is good. And the violence? Sheeeeeesh, get me a taco boy! Congo isn'

and it was appropriate that all the various supporting characters, including the dog and cat, had a role to end as well. It was never the major focus of this particular series, but the relationships and dynamics of the two principal couplers, the male and the male detective. (This is not a spoof on the couple from Homocides: The Movie. The two lead detective coupleres have to be some combination of male and female.) It was as if life does happen despite the best efforts and desire of the two main characters and they ended up on the outside. I suppose you could say that this is all about life, no one wins, and no one gets the girl. The series seemed to have been put together as if it would play the best as an indie film rather a network TV show that might not have had a life span. There’d been some continuity of cast over two different series set up by the same cast and crew at one time or the other. On Nirtave 10, it air at midnights on Starz, a network new to me. It should be remembered with fondness by many an “old hand”, fans of the original. I can recommend it for a good show, good light watching, good entertainment. If it had the sort-after audience in the old days, this series, especially in this day and time will be long forgotten in a very short while. It was a

Along with Sharpe comes a busload of inmates, including a handful from the old prison and a fresh batch of new blood (well, the old inmates are pretty old).

A story with many deep meanings, symbolic of the way we live our lives blind to what is really happening around us. When did we stop thinking for ourselves? How quickly do we give our minds over to others? What is more excruciatung than watching helpllessly as others do it? This story does not stop with the ending because that is the kind way of life, is it? So where does the story go after that? Does it just stop? Does it just fade away leaving the reader completely hollow and numbed? I believe the point the author was trying desporatly for his readers, so maybe the last chapter was for all of the confused readers who didn’t get it. I found the book lack of imagination. I found the writing technique to be extremely poor. I found all the characters had virtues that did not match their actions. Why so? The whole book was very vague and I could not connect with what was happening, so I wasted my $7 for the whole book. Maybe
something created in the seventies on an 8mm camera, and most likely was. That may be unbelieveble to many, and to most, incomperhension at that. But with each episode taking less time, even at 8 minutes a piece it still adds up to about an hour and a quarter. The camera work looks like it came from a bb gun. The editing and acting looks almost worse. I'm not sure if every single person is actually the actors playing thier characters or not, cause you can literally see where the makeup and the "costumes" stop and skin and cloth meet. The dialog. Ugh. I may want to use profanities, just so I can make this more horrific. Basically, a teenager comes home for the weekends for a while, then his friends are in it, then his girlfreinden is in one, who plays a prostitute/strip club worker. Oh, the atrocties it slices. Oh how it doles out the atrocitous. It has a story to it. I think. It has been ages. But trust me on one thing. This is not good in any sense of that word, not even the sense where it'll be so horriffically horrible you may like it. In any sense, avoid it at great length, and if you don'yav it, feel luck because you get
sexually attract women…etc etc….It' s sad. But the truth of it is that there are men, and I am a man by the skin, and not the clothes, who are trying to attract the opposite gender. And it is not always about sex. Men will not come out of their homes, and ask for sex, but they do come up with different ways to attract you, whether it is a gesture that you would find cuddly or a gesture that you find offensive, it is not intentional. Women of today are looking at the "what you can do" instead of the "what you are". I think it is a shame that a woman is looking at the sex that a man may be able to perform instead, she should look at his heart because he has one. Some women know that they are not going to be attracted, and the man knows it as he tries his best to attract her. That's called being a gentleman, a good attribute. Then there's the good old "play that game" the one saying that sex sneaks in when you least want to be partaking in that particular activity. I heard a story today about a man, who was "playing" a woman, and thought he had "got her", well I won' t go into the story, except to mention that he was a real winner with his "winning" ways, and got the surprise. Now I know
something entirely different from the film. In the first place I thought about the relationship between the characters. Astrid and the krämer gave one of them the possibility of happiness, and helped them find eachother again. A second thought I had is that the kids can be as much a part of their parents’ happiness as their children. I think I just love the idea of a film that shows this relationship; after all I thought that this would just a children’a film. The other thing is that the movie was a great example for non-violence. The parents could find their ways and solve problems nonvioluosally most of them. The krämers were a little more violent and therefore always the losers. If I remember correctly this was one of his first films which didn’t have any direct action, so it is easy to see why I like this film so much. I watched many of his films and always admire his sense humor. He could show it in different ways and did that in „Sophie’ Schnürt“, especially with Ava’ actions. I think it is a great movie to show to children and still good for adult. You should watch this movie, it is very good. I recommend it for anyone. Es ist ein wahres Highlight! I hope you like this movie as much I like and hope to hear from you soon. I would also enjoy some comments and responses from other users.
it did'nt have a single likable character and was so banal and formula it made me want to puk. That is an awful review but I guess i really needed an out... to go see such horrid crap makes me think that I must have something wrong with me. It has made a lot of $$ in the US, but not much will be made from me!!!! Still I liked the 3d and the violence was fun to look at - I could tell that the director had alienation complex. In fact all of them - if they had alitment complexes that is, you get them confused because they look and feel so alien! (Sic) - look in the making of to see - they seem so disturbed and troubled. Probably rich and banal but not so disturbed and trouble they need a doctor to tell me that. I guess maybe in americam if your rich you have a distboured childhood?? But I do not think it's a real story. What if you have disturbed rich kids? they just get a nice car, money and a flat in london and are out of everyone'd (did not mean everything) way. Don't they have the same right as the working classes to be fucking weird? (No, I am not weird.) - I hope you understand my gibber (rambling). It was so stupid and the script
trilogie, follows the life and times in this new millenium of Parisian "cigales" trying hard, some of the lucky ones even succeed to find a place in the world in which dream and nightmares seem to merge and cling together in a maze of contradictory passions. After two years of travleling in various camper, the family settles in a tiny Parisian appartment and has to endure the usual humiliation and daily raids when they are searching their camping gadags. But that'a just part of the drama. Little boy Django (playing the "Sissel Kaya character" in the series) decides to become a streetfighteing Romanian boy who lovely fight his inadulthood with various combats through the alleys of Paris. While their mother who has become a drug addicted whorer in the meantime, goes through the same process of loss of innocense. And last but not least, Django's brother Samir, his father Ilian and his uncle Zineddin and his wife Mara meet in a bar with which they will celebrate the circumcization of Samir's first son. It is an allegory about the fate of all immigration from around the world, that somehow will find themselves in the streets with small families, like the family of Django in the series.
