. The central character is an old woman who is dying. This character, Lila Waters, is played beautifully by Vanity Fair'smagazine's 25th Annual Hollywood Issue cover girl of the same name, Clare Danish who is in her late twens in real-life but plays a woman in her early-50s in filmdom. The character lives alone in Boston having been abandoned by one and all including her husband and daughter many years previously, her husband and daughter are dead and the latter'scold and uncaring attitude to her dying mama is revealed in a series a letters which are sent to Lila by the daughter'spersonal assistant. The film opens as the daughter's personal secretary, a gay black man, visits and tells her that her daughter, now a prominent physicians in New York, is dying and requests Lila come to New York and be with her. A series of flashbacks from the late 60s to the early '80a reveal a series if intimate relationships which have left Lilla embittered and alone; a relationship at college with a fellow academic which turns to violence; a long term affair with a married man which ends disastrosuly and, most poigantly of all for the modern viever, a gay relationship, in fact a sexual relationship with his secretary in the early's. The lesbian relationship, though int
the same budget as a big studio action film like Batman V Superman: $90-225 Million! Just a few years back, the idea of a film like this being released with the same production values would have been unthought of! This would be a good film to see in an actual cinema, but it is not one I think should be on a 40inch screen. The film is a good one to have on in a room by it self. The only way in a room is to have the whole film in one screen. There is a little bit of a problem with this, however. The story is a bit thin. This does make the film more interesting to me. There is a good amount to do in the story and this movie is worth watching. The story is about a young man who is sent on a mission to rescue his girlfriend. He is a great character for the film because the film does not focus on him. He is a good character, and the film is good for him. He is not the main reason for the film, however. The film is really about the young man and the people in it. The young woman is very good. She has a great deal to do in this film. The young man is really great. I think she is a great character because she can have a lot of different emotIONS. He has a lot of fun in it and the film is really interesting to watch. The
isn’t for the faint of heart, it picks straight back in to the series with the death of the last of the CIA operatives, and the fallout that is caused. The story follows the same structure with a new group on the hone and a new protagonist. I won't give the plot line away as this is one not to be spoilt, but you will be in it from beginning to end. The book does not disappoint. High quality characters, gripping plot and well constructed twist. 11/10 would recommend. Read it now. Now! Seriously, stop reading reviews and buy it. It'll change the world for you. The End. ........... ........................... 100% serious review, no affiliate links. No boring crap about this book or that book. Just a book lover's review of a book that was awesome. Enjoy. P.s. I read the series in this particular sequence, and if I could have given the books stars, I would. 5/5 from a 5 star series and author. No question. The book is the last part. The story will continue in a new series. So, if like me. you were worried you had missed something, the last part of this series is now in place for you to read. If, like some of those people who don’s read reviews, then
Italy it follows three friends as strange events start occurring after an accident. It'll take a couple of minutes for the audience, myself at any rate included , who are used the more recent gore filled offerings from Fulcio to get used to this slow, deliberate film. Fulci has a tendency here to take his time letting the story develop and this can lead a vieew to lose the will to wait at times but in reality it's worth it. The story is very good for this kinda movie. It has an odd feel about it that is very good. In fact the whole movie is quite odd. I've no idea why that last statement is true, but as I watched, I couldn`t shake of the odd feeling I had about the thing and this only added to my enjoy of the whole piece. The cast here is excellent and very believable (if that is the correct term for this genre). The acting by some of the main cast was very good indeed and helped to add another dimension to this film. The film itself is beautifully shot, again very unlike some Fulci later efforts. The music is very good and helps add to the whole atmosphere, and the way the film is put all together is a credit to the director and team. Fulci has given us a very good little movie here. It' so well acted and put together with a story that moves along at just about a right speed. In fact the
this film before (not that i've watched it or anything). I think it would be interesting if a couple more people who have seen it recently and liked it (like myself) posted there thoughts and maybe get some more people to watch it? I thought the film and sound was great but the storyline was a tad weak. Overrated I think...maybe? But I'm still happy that I bought it! :D Just my thoughts...anyways what do the rest think?

! But if we're going to do things properly, I'd rather we start with a discussion of the film in question, which has its good points, I should add. I'll do a quick review (in the interests of avoiding the dreaded spoiler) and then we can discuss the film's politics (and those politics of the politics) at greater length. I can say that this is the first Harry potter which seems very aware that it is in competition not with Lord Of The Rings, but rather the Twilights and Hungers of this year, which are, I would say (and many other reviewers seem in agreement), the more potently seductive fantasies of the moment. It feels more adult, more slick, and it has the added advantage (or drawback?) from the point of view I've chosen that the main characters are now teenagers. So while not quite as interesting for me as it might have once appeared to have the possibility to turn into, it is at the same very definitely something other than the kind of film I would have expected it be a year ago when I first saw the first three books in the shop at Waterstons, having been given the series to review as a gift by a friend. I have never actually read a single Harry Pottered. As I recall, I said I'd read them if I got the contract. But I haven’’ not got around
best. That certainly isn’t in this case. I haven’ t read the first book, and I don’ thnk I will. The movie has a good storyline and a great setting, both of wh ich are very appealing. The actors seem capable enough, although not one really stands out. It’s a fun movie and worth watching, but it could have been better. The story and dialog aren?t as sharp as they could have beens. Also, some parts drag. The movie would be a lot more effective if there werer fewer subplots and more focus. The ending, while not too unexpected, is not too satisfying either. If you?e a fan of the books, you’ ll probably like this. Everyo ne else might want a better option though, and you can?t go too wrong here. I recommend it. It?s entertaini ng enough. The movie is based off the book The Shadow in the N orth by Dean Koone. If you like this sort of thing (and you probably do), check it out. But I wouldn’ thnkyou’ll enjoy the book if you didn?t like the film. I don?t think this is a great movie. I think a more entertainig one is in the cards for you, but this is definitely entertainin g. I?ve given it 6-stars (out of five) because that just seems right for the amount
that brought DareDevil and Punisher"... I guess they're not going to try to sell it as "from that dude who brought you Kung Pow" or "from The Matrix team". I guess the studio thinks the Matrix team are better off doing The Matrix stuff and not trying out a bunch of other stuff. I guess you have that "Burn Notice guy and the guerrilla film maker who does a lot of music vids" as the only guys left of the original "Matrix" crew that are doing stuff. (I' m not that familar with "The Matrix" so my knowledge of the crew is limited.) I do hope there aren"t any Matrix sequels in development... I'm not really a fan. Maybe if they were going for a real cyberspace "The Truman show" style thing it might be different. I think the Matrix crew did the Anime film "Gothic and Lolli" which I liked but that seems to have fizzled. I think there are so many films that are basically variations on "Ghost" and there seems no end to how long that thing will keep getting remade and how far the film makers can stretch the concept in the future so I think it would be best for everyone to let Coranado be a stand alone film and just move on. I really don' t think there'll be another one. There are so few good

who leads the Chinese mob. The first scene shows the mob taking a man out of town and shooting up a restaurant. They then show up to a building where all the mob baddie wanna bes are and vote. The votes are counted and one man leads the mob. The man who won the vote doesn’ts want it. There’t a big mobster in Hong Kong that he doesn't have some connection with, so he knows who’ll kill him if he doesn't play along. He goes about his mobster duties and soon finds a rival group of triads are after him and the group. His life is turned into chaos and he’s not quite sure who's on his team and who't his opposition. The man is played by the talents that is Louis Fan. There was a bit too much mobster talk for my liking, and while there is fighting in the film, it’s more of a drama than an actual action film. The story moves at a slow place and the film is a slow ride for the most part. There is action in there and it’s a lot better when the action takes centre scene. The first ten or fifteen minutes is a great start to the movie but the story takes over and there is a lot more talk of mobster business and not enough action. I’d love it to get a release to see what else there was to the ending because it cut away before it
but the 15-minutes of a silent film are like a short and concisely-executing poem. And like most poetry, you either “feels’ it as you read or it doesn’t speak much to you on its surface level of analysis or meaning at all; but, you are the one experiencing these emotional and physical moments, not someone telling them to you. And the more it makes a connection with you, you start to dig a lot deeper and try to analyze your own emotinal reaction to what happened in a film, and that’ the true mark and beauty in the silent era in film. In this case, Brown is a silent film where you either get it or you don;t. You’e left to your imagination to fill in many of the gappes in the film and if you don’t, the emotions and repercussive actions of the events are not only lost on you but you’e left out completely, like a person not able to see a beautiful painting and just staring blank at it. For me personally, I felt this connection and I’e seen a few of James Brown’ films, and I’e read about him and I know this was based off the life of a Harvard football player who committed murder and was then found innocent, but the film doesn’ tell us these things, we have to fill them in for ourselves. That’ the power in the film and that
Year's Evo films I'd seen before, and a good companion to 'Tokyo!'. It's a story of love, loss, and hope. It's also a story with a good ending, even though it's a bit predictable (as most happy movi'e are.) This film will make people laugh and leave you with something to take away. It is a very enjoy'eable film, and the best part of this one is that there isnt much dialog. It's a very quiet, yet interesting, film with good cinematographic and a great sound track (with 'M' by the Beach Boy)s and 'River's and it has some funny parts, a little of drama (but just enough) and a great story with an unpredictab'le ending. It's a movie I will be watching for years to'e, so I would defin'tely recommend this film to you guys! En"joy! The New 'eve (aka, 'E've of the New Year') is the name given to'a movie which was released to the public in 1887. It is also a movie which was released to 'the general'™e public in the United ''tated States on December 26th
thought I'd give the two winners a fair chance to impress. I think they succeeded. They're both pretty hot. Both are good singers. One is more talanted but I think the other is more charismmatic (and has the bigger boobs!) I think this one has more of a Bollywood feel. There've also been a lot fewer Hinglish and Hing-lish songs lol! It's got some catchtunes and has some great songs. This is the first I've seen of a Bollywood movie that has a song where they sing the word 'baby'. The music's better than the usual Bollywood stuff and is worth checking. Some great dance sequences too (although, as usual, there'll always be more dancing than actual dancing!) I think this movie is going up against Dabba and Dabka and is worth your time if you've seen them both! I'd also recommend the Hinglish songs. I think they fit better with the movie. I give this movie a solid 5 because it'a good movie. If you'e not into Bollywooood, it might bore you. But if that'a what ya like, there are many good songs. The acting and the songs and the story and the choreography and even some funnies. So if you have the time and the money, check it oout. But
made as I just couldn'y get myself to believe they weren't from the 80s or 9os. It'd have been easier to just accept it as true though, as if you just look at it and don'tt take the whole episode it does seem real. I have to say that while I've liked this series up until this episode, this may be the best yet and a great example of an episode of The Office at it'so finest. It may also have been the most controversal, even with the show'so audience. It really does feel more like something that would have been shown in the mid 9oos and it'sd pretty amazingly done if I do have too say. It makes the series feel more real than ever and it has a lot that I liked to it. One of the things I like is the idea that in a series of 20 episodes that only 10 are made up, with 5 being documentaries. It'ss a very cretive idea and one that makes the series feel even ore real. I think it may also be the best example of how The US version is different to The UK version. The UK version had the whole series done as documentaries, this version makes it feel ore like an acting show and the US one is ore like an office show and that's one thing that I think I liked a little more about this one than the other
how everyone has nothing, and no-ones got a job and we all have no money and life is just so horribly shite and woefully unfair blah,blah,blah. The most successful British film of all time is ‘Bridgit Jones’ Diary‘ which makes it the biggest load of toilet water I have seen since I was 12. And it is the one film that sums up the whole depressive, dysfunctional British film world of recent time perfectly; it is the biggest insincarnation of how the British film industry feels it should be seen. The biggest load, and the most successful. A film that is as far away from the truth as one could possible get with the world of cinema today; a film that makes the British film industry look like some sort of a clowns convention, where they all dress up in their biggest and ugliest clothes they can manage, and then they proceed down to the local town centre with a huge bag in hand to go on some sort on a shopping sprees whilst everyone around them stands there looking at them with their jaw’d dropped to the floor in a state of complete and absolute confusion wondering why they are so utterly ugly. I can’r help but wonder how it came to it all being like that in Britain and what the hell happened to our sense in cinema. I mean, I just can’t understand why anyone would find Brid
movie, but I'd like to say why. (There's a difference between an "unpleaseable movie," which you just didn;t like, for a number if perfectly good artisic reasaons - and a truly bad and incompentant film.) I'll do a longer post about this after I'v e seen the other DVD, but in brief, I'd say - there was a real movie there - and a good one - if somebody had made it. (And, if not for the unpleasable casting of the female leads...) But, unfortunately... I have seen so much bad and worse made by Hollywood - I can;t say this was even near the bottom: there was a good idea behind it, a good director (even if a bit un-confidant, perhaps, in the material), a decent budget and an overall okay production - it was, at best a B-picture, but a bad "A-picture" at that - that is, they spent too much and got too litlle for their bucsk. I donno, perhaps if I;d never sseen a decent film before, and this had been my first - then I would'v e been wowwed. As a friend once pointed out - there's "good bad" and then there' s "bad" bad, as opposed to "good," which is just a matter, then, of whether

But i do remember this movie, it was truly a classic, and the last movie that made me feel this way. I may be a little over the top, and may not know a movie from my ass. If that's so then i am sorry for being so ignorent and I am sorry about not knowing the moviemaking and the technical aspects that go into making a good film, but I do not care. This is the one of best moviies i have ever seen, and will forever be one of the movies that i will remember. I may be sentimentality. I may have a weakness for romance, but what i have is a good feeling and good heart. I am a little soft on the inside, and it'll take someone to break it. The movie did it. It'a a movie that is beautiful and will be remembered not only for its great acting, direction and story, but because of a few scenes that made my heart sing and made my eyes tear. For example: When Sally walked out on the porch. When Sailly and Harry met at Katz Deli and talked. And the scene after they had sex was brilliant. This movie is simply brilliant. It'll always be
are the three sons of Ulyssess, played respectively by John Huberman, John Howard (The High & Low-Way), and Jackie Cooper (Sky Raider), who, after a lengthy prolog which takes us from Uysess's final battle to the deaths of his sons, set out to find their long missing father. They do so, and, after a long battle with the suitors, they take back the throne of Ithaca from the grasp of the evil usurpers. The acting in the film is quite passive with only the three lead performances having any real spark and the villainious suitror is quite banal, even though the actor is given a few lines to mouth. Some of the special visual effets are nice, especially the transformation of the three men from boys to men and the burning suitors. The film is a bit long, and the ending is not as dramtic as one would like for such material. However, the film is quite entertaininmg and I give a 6 out 10. The film did not do to hot with audinece when it first opened in 1953, but it has since gained its reputation on TV and is now a minor cult favourate for film fans. A few scenes have appeared in other TV shows and movies. The most obvious is in the first episode of "The Addams Family". You're right, G
normal kind of chick that can be fuckin banging hot but this chick right here is smoking hot and she looks like she can be a total freak if you fuck wit this kind chik i can guarantee she will be a freak in da bed.

Man i love how this movie was put together it's a real good film and it was great to get all the behind the scene footege of this movie. The actors in this movie are all very nice looking and they all play their roles very nice so I can see how this is a very good story. It'S good that they added some behind the scenes of footage because that makes the whole film more interesting and gives u a good idea of what goes and happens when making a feature film. I like how they also added the behind the scenes footage of the movie. I also like the special effects and how they added this to this awesome movie. It'Sh great when movies come out with all these extras because it adds
contrast, Howard seems to have taken the simple plot, added a complex message on greed and environmentalism, added a bunch more unnecessary characters. What does he gain? He gets a bunch more money! And the film’s not much fun. There is a scene where Horton sees a drop fly off into the air that’s actually quite nice. But that’s a very small portion of the movie. The only reason it got an Oscar nom is because the Academy has no idea what animated movies have to offer. That, the film’s budget and the director (he’s an “auteure” now; look it up) being in favor with Academy voter, the film got that recognition, not on the strength of its actual movie, but on the strength on its reputation. Howard’s a nice enough guy, I suppose. But when he’s making stuff like “How The Hedge Was Made”, he’s an overrates hack in my book, not an “auteur.” And the Academy’ s just as bad for letting him have his way with this classic story. It’ s like letting George W Bush direct a movie. Oh, wait … . . . . . he’ s got some in the works already. Oh well… . The Hedge (20-Mar-08) ★½. 19th Ann. Hmph! The Hmfph! Awards. My favorite
this film. I hope at some point in time it will be better than it looks now... But now the book looks better than the movie. So sad. I hope it will at least entertain me, I do love to laugh and it was hysteral. But the story line is really messed! I hope they will make another one, and they will get all the characters in it and they will have better writers. What a bum! And I am a big fan for both! I am so sad. It is really messy... I will have the DVD in a few days, I hope it will give me some hope in it. But now, I feel like I am not going into the theartre anymore! That is how disappointed I am. I really do love the actors though! I hope they will make a revised version and a better one! So sad! I am sorry to say this, but the movie was really mess! And I do love both the books and movie!!!!!!!!!! I am sorry. But I can' t keep it inside. Please, do make a remade version, please. And get all of the characters in it and the actors, please. I am so sorry! I am really disspoitned. Why did I see this one? Why? Why?! I am so so so sorry to disapointed the actors. I do love the actors. I know they did their job
of work above a 5 should be sent back into the dark ages. I have only seen this movie once when it first appeared in theatre, I was bored for the first 2 hours, I was still asleep the last hour. There are many movies that are very boring in some areas (I would say many), but this movie is a complete fiasco and I am glad I was bored, otherwise I would know that I wasted my 2 hours of life on a terrible movie! I can't wait to read the reviews from the next people to watch this movie again. I would rather have a 10 hour long movie about the life of a cockroch (or any other uninterestable insect for matter) rather watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy again. I was going to watch it for free online, but the free part has made me very happy, otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the chance to waste my time. If I didn’t have other things planned for today and tomorrow I would have watched it for real (and I would give my review). But it was better not, it would have been another two wastes of time. I can understand how some might like it, but to me there is a movie that was boring to me and one that makes me angry to have wasting my precioud time on it. This movie is an example how good movies can
is working for a company called "Gimmicks, Inc", and the head boss (played very well by Harry Dava) is always trying to find a new gimmick. They are always looking to sell more stuff and come up on the idea of putting a free "Psychic" into every box. This guy is a real nut, and is always spiting gibbbering about nonsense that sounds like fortune cookie advice and then saying "you have a problem that you don'thave to have". He is a real nutball and the bumbling Mcdoakes is trying to avoid his wrath when he finds a free "Pychick" himself. He takes it home, trying not be noticed, but the "psyhick" is a real pain. Joe is trying his best not to let the psychotic "pyschick" in on his business, and the "Psychic" does all kinds or wackiness. I enjoyed the film a great deal, especially the ending. Mcdoaakes ends ups going insane at one moment, and the "psycick" starts to talk about himself, and then starts to talk about how he has a "problem that he dont have", but then the "pscyick" goes off to find his own "problem that dont have". He finds the "problem that donthave" and he starts to act crazey too.
actors as they had to perform this garbage. I only watched this movie as I had just finished reading A.I. which is a brilliant novel but this movie was such a disappointment. The acting is awful, the story line makes no sense (or atleasts makes sense only to the writers of A.i.). Donnie Dark (Jake Gyllanhall) is an etherial teen who seems to be stuck between two worlds, the reality and his vivid imaginative world. At first I loved this kid for being such an interesting character, then I hated him for his insane actions and the ending is just unexplainible. I really don’t think I will recommend watching it. Save up for the DVD if there is one, if so, then maybe you would like buing. But then, I think it will end up in my dustbin with a huge dent on the cover as I would love throwing this movie in the truck and driving over it, so don't expect my rating of this movie to be high, I give this movie a 3. It'll never win the Oscar for worst movie but definitely it's in my list. I really can't understand people who love this film and think its a classic -_-...well I guess it was a nice movie just a bit too weird for me. My only positive comment is that the music in this film is excellent, it was done
say it's a good film - in which category does it belong then? Maybe neither, as the film really falls somewhere in the grey area of not so bad films that are not so good films, and thus is quite easy on the eyes for the most part. It'd be wrong, however, not mentioning the film's shortcomnges, so here goes: it's quite a drab affair in the visual department; while it' still a nice looking picture, a bit too much of a studio set, with not enough natural light and colours - even some scenes of the characters in a forest look unnaturaly dark and gloomish; the actors don’t deliver much either: the film could've really benefitted from the presence on a stronger lead actor, such a Bogie, or even a better Gould, to make a film a little more tense; the music is forgetable; the story is a very simple one; and to top it all, the ending is so very un-satysifying that you'll want to scream "Whaaaaaaaaaat??????!!!!". And I'd really love to know what kind of person would find a film about a woman with a broken arm in jail and another one, in the same jail, who keeps her arm inside her sweater to show that she still has it, all that funny? I didn't and so the
film I can remember seeing. I love the characters, their chemisties and relationships, their little moments of real life that you can't help laughing at. A really touching film that's so worth watching more than once, just to savour those great moments. (9/10) The cast is really well picked and everyone plays well. They give the film a really believable and realistic feel. A lot of the characters really shone, in some parts you couldnât stop your self thinking, "that was a bit over doneâ? but that really added to the characters and the way that the film flow. The actors have done an outrageously good job. (10/08/07). 680704184650. I have to admit that before I saw this movie I was worried that it was the same as most movi es. There are a lot of good things that this movie can bring. But one of my favorite parts is when they were playing chess. I really think that it was one of the most powerful moments in the movie. I also love how they are able to communicate with eachother through chess. I also love how the characters all talk to eachother about the most intimate things. I also like how they all play music together and how they all play a different instrument to add something special. Overal this movies
horrid, especially that woman. The plot and the script are horrid too. Just skip watching this and watch "Night Of The Living Dea..", it'll be way better. That woman is so bad that she makes me want go see "The Last Exorticism" again and again to rember good actors. I'd recommend the movie to the most un-intellectual audience possible, like a 3rd graders class. Even the children will find it too much.

sense and sensuality are both asleep at the switch and the only surprise left is the one we get at its conclusion, which tells the audience not only that the film is over, it’d better be. It has no more to say that matters or makes sense. And it was all a horrific nightmre. I wish the film and I could wake up and it will have all be nothing but some hideus memory that hau’t left a permanent scar. I wish this were a dream, because I have just woken up from that nightmare to a new one. I’m in a bad, bad movie. And the worst thing is that no one else seems aware of it. I mean I was aware of the badness, but no one else was. I was so aware, I was aware enough to be annoyed with all these other viewing zomnbeies who were too zombieficated and aswleppt to wake and realize they’re living the worst nightmare ever. It’d been bad enough they were asleep, and had not even a shimmer of consciousness that this movie was a bad one to begin with and was going on. But it was worse when they woke and saw me sitting there, awash in this sea I did’st even think possible, of the worst nightmare ever. And then, they were awake and could see my
film after seeing it. I can understand why, as this is very hard hitting and I found it very de-press-ing to be franck. I am sure if you can get through it, it is a powerful and moving experience but it took me a week to get over the de-pres. sion. The only good thing about this film, was the ending scene. I don's understand it at all and I am not going to tell what it entaile. but I loved the way it was written and the way they chose to finish it. If this movie is your kind of thing I think you'll love, but I couldn;t help cry at one scene which left me feeling down for weeks and still not sure if I got the story right or what the hell it was all for but I was entert.ained by some of the characters and I really liked the fact that the main character was female as she was strong and had a lot about herself. I think this was great for a first movie from this director who is now in his early 2.0's. A really great movie and well worth seeing. I hope you enjoy it. 9/9. I hope you like this review and please let me now if you do like it, and tell your friend to watch it, but if you do not then just move on and enjoy the movie and tell your friend to see it because it.s better than the book.
any sense if watched for fun. I do, on my second view, see what was going on in it but it was not fun to see the second or even third time around. It is a darker, gloomed up movie with not many light moments. But as I have said, the cinematography is amazing. There're lots of scenes with long tracking shots as if the camera follows the characters all along. The movie is a bit confusing because you never really know for sure what was going on in the movie. There're lots and lords plot twist throughout the movie. It really gets to your nerves. But I am very happy I have seen it and I am pretty proud that my boyfriend and I saw the whole film, as there are lots and lots and lots and lots of characters in this movie and it is hard to follow along sometimes. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone to see it unless you want to see it as an artist of sorts. It really is a piece of a movie that is made to look "nice and well-made artistic-ly" but is not much fun. But again I loved the cinematograpy. The soundtrack was good too (and that is always important as it can make or break a good film) and the story, well it was there. But as with all good movies it does not have to make any real sencse but to make us wonder what is going
an emotionally honest and heart-wringing story about the relationship of sibs. That's what "The Fare" is, in its entire wayward journey, and it does a pretty effective job, even though it'll take you into areas you won'tona. In an attempt to tell the entire truth of his character, writer/director D.C Fitzgerland uses a framing device that shows us our hero, a hack driver named Parker (playd by Gino Galento), as an adult, a successful writer, in the middle (presumably, but we never know) or a marriage crisis of some sort. He's a man on the edge of a clifffrom which he can either jump or be pushed. He doesn'ttell the truth to the woman he'sona (Sarrah Strimel) that there will not only not ever been another book, there will not ever even be a first book; that book was a total failure and the one and only that will be issued, he will tell us, when he's dead and his daughter (played by Sasha Pieter-Scheele) has the book published. It's a good set-up, a good framed story about the writer's life and a man on the edge of life. In the flash-forwards we'll see his character as he was in his earlier life and in the flash
also does not follow the original story. If you don’ t find this kinda fun, just ignore it. But if this is really annoyi ng for you – it is better you do not download and see it at first place..! 80%of the movie is in tune with original, with some changes. The rest is all my imagination. 1) This was an idea of mine long ago. I got the inspiratio n to write it from a similar movie, which was also not that great, called “Scooby Doo 2”. I always thought that if I could get a chance I could make it better than that. Finally, after so manys stereo types, I got a chan ce and started writing the story, but it came as some kind of a short story – which is now posted on my blog for all to read. That short was supposedly a story told in a college lecture by a professer, as a part o his lecture on a course on film study. But the movie is a different take on the same story, though the basic story is same. But here, there is a new character added – and that is me, the narraror, who keeps giving his commentar y on things happening. So what I have is a story, and a commentator, but without a hero. Now I needed one, and who better than the great Shivaraj Kumars character,
- it was a very good movie, not as I was told. Not a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it. Not a "must see" IMO; but it's definitely an enjoyable movie. And it has some nice nudity... I think it was the best part of the movie ;) It has 7 nude/porn stars, but none of them has a "stunning" nude, not really worth watching. So, I wouldn´t call "Clubland", the porno flip side, a waste - but it would have been really much better with less "hot chicks in skyscrapeer heel shoots" and a little less "fuck this and f**k that" from the director :) I give 4/1, and recommend a rent to people, that can get this film on DVD. I think Paul Rud's performance is one of the main reasons why this film works - so a recommendation of this film is actually a recomendtion from Paul Rudd as well ;) But not a "MUST-BU-IT-ON-DAY1-OF COURSING" type of movie - more like "rent and buy on sale" type of movie :) And I give 3/2 to "clubLand", the DVD, because of the extras. It´s a really good extra, but it´ll take some hours to load it up and watch it to
) given her appearance at the 1977 Oscars. She was the "girl with big hair". Her appearance in Blazing Stewardships and the famous beach scene from the film 000111 made Derek an international super star. Bo' Derek is probably best known for her hair. The image of Dillon's long, flowy lox became a cultural phenomenon and the subject for much parody, but Derek is more talanted that most know. Bo Diddliy Bo's name comes from a joke her late ex husband, film producer John Asher, made. Diddly bo is also a slur for "little". "Bo' "is "girly or girl". It was John's idea that this was a good screenname for his beautiful girlfriend. The actress has also appeared in Bolero, Tarzana Shores and Ghoulies 2, Ghoulie III.

...but I thought I'll try! This is one I've actually seen in the theater and I loved it! I've also bought it twice now! It came out in 1987 and I'm 100 sure I watched this as a kid...but I can still remember being in theaters with my family and thinking this was awesome! I was probably 6 or so and I'm not sure what it is I really loved about it....the fact that it was a little creeps...or that it was set during Halloween...or the music... or maybe just that I remember having a good family experience. I know my mom loved that it was about a young girl that loved to write. She was the one that introduced us to books and literature and that was a bond we shared as I grew up. Anyhoot, I'll tell you that this film was just as fun to watch now as it ever was. I had forgotten soo many details but I'm soo glad we watched this again. For starters, it'll make you nostalgic for Halloween! I think a huge part that makes this film work at all though is the cast and I think they are all so good...especially the kiddie characters. The little girl that lives down in the celler is SOOOO good and so is the gui that lives above the book store. He'
ed to kiddie audiencence, but has very few joky and cute scenes. On contrary it has very dark and disturbing scenes, with some pretty violent moments. It is quite interesting to see it. You have to wonder for whom the film was meant to. The film seems quite untypical for its era. Even though the film is in black&white, it looks quite colorful (because it is shot out of doors. The film is shot in Mexico and is very realistic in it´s approach. The acting is good and the direction quite solid, but not much memorables. Still not so bad film to watch. I enjoyed it. But it is far too long film for what it delivers... 3/6. (I would have given 7/ 8/ 9, but it doesn´tknow how, why or for what it is made). I wonder what would be the reaction of kida to the film. I can imagine they would be boring to death. I wonder if adults would like the film or they are also going be board. It is so hard film to give some advice if it worth or it is not. I enjoyed watching it, even though I don´t know what to think of it. The only thing I know is it should be seen by anyone into the Mexican film production of that era. And that it is a good thing to watch. The only problem is that
CGI to look realistic by acting just like his dog at home, a 20 p.lb Jack Russel Terrier. The director tells him no matter, it is a CG dog and will move like he tells him, not how the dog acts. He also tells Dutch the dog will not eat, shit, or pant, and that the dog will bark, when the dog feels like bark and not a second sooner. Dutch goes to the dog trainer for a bit more instruction about how he wants his dog to act. The trainer says she will make the dogs move and bite in ways they do in real life and that the dog is only trained in oblique and direct attacks with the use of a pistol or rifle on the part of the victim. She shows him how the dog will attack him and tells him this will cause him the least amount of pain. He says he likes it. The dog will bend and bend and bend and never bite until the dog says bang. He will not say bite until the gun is pulled on him or the punch is thrown. He is told this is to make it easier to use real footge, not CG. He is told the CGI will be made to bite when the dog barks in the CG and that the CG will be told to not bite, not bite. The CGI dog is a CGI and a real
reasons of events to make for a very boring watch. It is as if the producer took the most mundane and boring parts of a book and put it in a film. Apart of the film is not even about a book and there’a very brief scene that shows the character reading. This is a complete fail on the producers behalF. They should be ashame for wasted peopled and the authors hard work to bring a film to life! It looks nothing and is nothing of which is what I wanted to watch! Disgusting! I wanted my 2 hours back and I feel sorry for anyone who watched this waste of their time! Do yourself and favour, do not watch! It is awful! Don’y waste your time watching it. It doesn;’t even follow a storyline at all! It just jumps into events without showing the character even reading! It is awful! I don;t understand how they have been ableto put their heads up to this film! It just makes me angry! If you want some entertainment then read a book! This film does not even have a plot! How can a producer and director call this a film if it has nothing to do to the book? I feel sorry anyone involved, especially the actor! They need their 2 hours back of watching this nonsensical film and so do I! I’m so angry I watched it! I wish I could turn
hero is Jack Graham (James Farentino), an idealistic but rather dim young man who joins his uncle (John Millais) on a trip to Moscow. Uncle and Nephew are there for one reason: to help an anti-commie politician, Yuri Andreov, secure the votes he will probably win in a rigging election to be the new Premier of the USS. Jack is not aware that his uncle, the US envoy to the Soviet, is really the CIA agent in the game. The Russians and Americans want the election rigged in Yuri' s favor, so that he will be in a position not only to control the Soviet but also to become an ally in a future Cold-War struggle. The Russians have their own candidate, the cynical Andropov (Dana Elkkar) but Yuru has the upper hand. The Counter-Intelligence agent Andrei Yakovich (Omar Shariff) is on the trail of the Americans, and a romantic triangle develops with the American, British, and Russian representatives falling in and our with their respective women. A great cast that makes up for the weakness of this over-complication plot, and a few great lines. "How do I hate the Russian. I count ways every day" "I know you are not as dumb as I thought" and "The only difference between a good spy and a
LOTR in comparisons with the book and how the movie does it. But, I'm not going to just rush in and say the movie is caca. Because it is not (for the majority of parts, at lease). So, let us continue. As a critic of a movie like this is very hard. I mean, what is there that I could pick on? Well, the book is very rich in characters, some of which we never heard or saw at any other time in the books, or the mov. Well, except for Aragorn. But, I have heard many people criticize Aragorn, as if the movie was made to make Aragorn look good or something (not that there is anything wrong with that). I will tell my opinion on his part soon (and many others, as well). I will not give to many of my own views and ideas, as it is the moviemakere that is making the mov, not I. I would just give to much away, as I have not even seen the movie a third time yet, so my own idea could be a bit clouded. I do admit that if I was directing, the ending could have ended a bit different, but that is only my own personal taste. I am sure that the director would have loved it had the ending been different for me. Well... on that matter, it really doesn't matter how the ending was. In the end it
looked a little strange, and I think a lot of people thought so. In this movie he portrayed an author, writing about a fictitous serial killa...who actually turns out to be his son, whom he has just met. The story was a good premise. There were some very good, even some very fun, scenes, but the acting was pretty poor, and a few of my friends have said the script was a bit too simple. However Brosnan did a good job, as did Danny De Vito as Brosnan and Deirdre O'Kanyon as his wife. In the film his character wrote a book called "The Goldfish" which was the title of the film. All in, I'm glad I watched it once, but wouldn't watch it more than once, or recommend it highly, as an average film. I'd give a 6 out of 9. But that doesn' t mean it wasn;' t enjoyable. I'd give it a go. I'd also recommend "Mrs Hendersens's Neighbor" if you like Danny Devita. (Not a comedy though...more a real story) Enough from this movie buff! Have a great one! 4th May.16, 3.30pm.

It's a must for fans as it's a must-see for people who're not familiar with the great Peter's works.< Less More I saw this film in the cinema in the '60' and I still like it! Peter Ustinova and his partner John Gayvin are a brilliant couple, I have always loved these two actors. The plot of the film is well constructed. The ending is very beautiful and touchant. Peter Ustinovo is a great comediante who has always been able to play various types of roles in different films. The plot of the film, however, is not original (as I think for the other films he has done at this time). But the film
it is almost identical and there is no other point of reference to it's original form apart of course from the original title music. The cast is good and it is good to have some decent actors playing some very well written parts. That is the only plus point to this rehash of a classic and it'll take a lot more than a well cast and well written story to make this film interesting. It's just a pointess and boring waste of time. Avoid at the cinema at any cost or at all!!!!!!! There is nothing worth looking into with it. It'a very poor show and a very very bad remake of an excellent original. Shaun of of The Dead is a masterpiecc of the horror genre!!!!!!! There, I've seen both of them and I can compare them!! Avoid!!! Avoid!!!! AAVOID!!!! AVVOOIDD!!!!!!!! AVVIIIIIIIODIIDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!

this is something of disappointing waste of resources and talent, especially since the story itself is pretty thin. If you want to watch a good heist film then watch Ocean’’s Eleventy or The Thieves. This is all style without any real substance. There have also bee a number of films recently set in and made in Korea. This is a good one for the reasons that it is an excellent showcase and has a strong lead performance by Kim Min-hee as the young, naive but determined con- artist, who gradually learns to appreciate her elder and wiser partner in crime played by the charlmingly cool Kim Sysin-ho . The film is beautiful to look but is lacking any real depth or drama or any genuinen’t emotional investments in any of he key characters. All in a rather disappointingly superfial and forgettable movie.. The story is that of a Korean thieving team, consisting of a man in is thievery twilight years and his eager, if not rather na’ive prote ‘g ” who are planning their greatest score yet, a heist of a prestig’ous jewel in a hotel v’aul ‘. The plot is thin and the script poor, although there a re moments of humour, particularly from the vetera’n character, played by Yun Jong-bin. The film was also released in North America and Europe under
told with such a lack luster performance and a complete disinterst of it's characters that the movie fails on just being bored. You could say it is a character study which works in the sense that it could make you wonder who these people are and how they got this way but the movie does such poor jobs of showing you this that you just don’t seem invoved or care at all. I was bored. The characters were boring. The story was uninterest. I can't really remember much after the movie was over. I just remember thinking, "Thank God it'll over soon" but by this time of course it'll over. The movie was just bored. I don;t think the movie had to have some kind of action or suspense, it didn;' give it a more engrossing character. There is a moment toward the end where you think the movie was maybe headed in that direction, but the movie never goes down that road which is a shame, and then the ending is just as boring. The movie had potential but the movie doesn';t deliver and it really doesn;' deliver anything. I am a fan of character studys and movues and I think the movie could be really interesting, but this just does the characters a huge injustiece. A boring character study is a bad character study. The movie is bad. The film is so bad that it is a

Leslie Nielson'a "Fast Food Fast Food" sketch. And there was no food, anywhere. Not a single café on that street. This is a street which is, in fact, called "Le Cours Des Vins de France". There's an open air fruit, vegetable & herb (and flower) market here, and some of the street vendants here sell wine. I'v not seen them, though, since I was not here before noon (and it's now 1:32PM). I did notice that I can see a few vine leaves in my hotel room window, and the room is on, what, maybe the thirthi floor? So...it'll do. And there's always a supermarché a few blocks from the hotel, so I'll be all right. The problem I was facing this morning was that I needed a place to get a showeer, and my hotel didn't open until 2.

better send-out than they’ve gotten from the Farrelli/Rattler team. I’ma get a lot on my chesstt today, folks, but I hope you’ll stay and listen. Let't get on the Stooge bus! You never have to worry that one of the characters will have sex. It was an era when sex was something one did to procreate—it was not something people talked about. That was the 1950s. And The Three Chords of the Farrelli brothers. We're gona tell you some stuff about how you can be a good person. We got two new movies for people who want fun, like, "The Three Stoogies" or "Three Chords". The Farrellis are a comedy duo made up of Bob Farreli, who was a music director for several moviemaking companies, and Jim Abrahims, who wrote and directed several comedies and dramatized movietoons for children such a"The Pajama Game", which was also made. I love the Farrelly Brothers, I love Jim Abraxan, and I love the Three Chord. I don’ t think it is any surprise to see why The Brothers Farrellis and Jim Abraxan are two of our most important movietoers, and why Jim’s “The Boss’s Daughter
comments: The illustrations of the animals and insects are well done, though I would like to have more illustration in the book. The book is very well research, but it is rather a zoologist than an artist. I am not sure if this is a good thing or bad, because the book does not give any illustrates of animals, except a few draws. The text is very detailed and it is very well written and very interesting. The book is very interesting and well done. However I would recommend this book to anyone. This has been one the books that made this blog. I think this blog has been a success because of the great information and the great pictures. I can' t remember the last post that made me think about this. I have just finished this and will post it later. The pictures in my blog have been posted. There are some good pictures, but I will have more. Thank you. This is like an art book. The illustrations of these animals are very well drawn and the animals and the animals are very accurate. The text and illustrations are very accurate also, but not very detailed and the illustrations are not good enough. This will be a good book for the book lover. The book is very interesting and well-done. It has been one the books that made this book. This has just made me think about this book and it has made this blog. Thank You. This is like a zoological text book,
the time, but I wasn't blown over by the experience and the memory of the movie faded. But I was so intriguing by the concept behind the film that I had the screenwriter, Paul Chitlik (and I had met him at NYC'S BRAINSCREAMERS back on 10/3/02) contacted in the hope of conducting a lengthy interview on his behalves of the film. Unfortunately Mr.Chitlik had a very low key promoting of the film so he had not given much thought to an interview. However he did answer a very brief email questionnaire about SEA. It was a shame he did not give this film more of a push because it is quite good. I will be reviewing the film itself in a future column. I did have the opportunity to talk to the film' s director/actor James Cullens. His comments follow. -JC- The following questions and answers were compiled by Mr.Chitlk and answered via email by director, James Culllans.

in Norway with Norwegian cast and in a Norwegian environment, we find a real-life film story. It has a very good plot, is a very well-made film of the high standard you expect of a Hollywood movie and it is full of surprisings which makes it an intriguing film. The actors are all very skilled and the director, who is a very well-exercized one has done his utmost to keep the film a realistic one. I was so amazed and delighted, that I have recommended it as a movie to buy on DVD, and I was not disappointed one little little. <br ><a class="readmore-icon" aria hidden="hidden" onclick="/web/210310/readmore/28912" target=="" title=""> Read more »<i></i>&nbsp;</a></p> |<p><a title=="" href="/web/gallery/2.jpg" class="btn-gallery"><i class=icon-eyepiece></a ><a title=="" href="" class="">Gallery /  <a title="" href="/web/" class='btn btn-gallery btn-small'>Preview<br /</i> <i class="></i>&nbsp;}<a></a></p><h1 class=headline>Titles and Synopses</h1
will not help, but there are other ways to cheer yourself. If you are feeling down then I recommend one or more of the following remedy for the soul: watch Raging Bull; listen to John Coltran's My favorite thing; play through the first movement of Procol Harum A Salty dog; read Moby-dick; sing along to The Who My generation or play the video game, Fallout. I have also found comfort with the help from this book. It's a collection from various essays from the Guardian newspaper. They are collected under various headings: The Good Life/Bad Life; The Body and Soul; The Pleasures and Pangs of the Imagined Life; and A Place of Peace. Each piece is well-chose, some from famous writers like John Steinbeck; others from lesser-known. I read it from beginning to end. It'll be good company for me. If, of a morning you woke on the cold side of the bed then you could pick this up and read any of the essays, or dip in and find one you need. My favoruite is an esssay called 'The Snake Charmer' from Gerald Durrell: "The thing that I like is that I know exactly what to think and feel about this snake. I am not at all like the man who comes upon a sack of coins and wistfuly wonders what
his pact of Non-Intervention with Hitler. A great change was taking place. The Communist Party began breaking down. Many intellectually sincemembers of Communists left. They were shock by Krushchev's speech because, in the Communism they were educated with, Stalins was always the hero. Now Stalin became a traitor and Kruschov a hero. The communists in power in Czechoslovakas wanted to be independent of the Soviet control, but this meant a great change in the whole Communism Party. In Poland and in Czechoslovaka the change began with the new generetion of the Communist Party, which was more liberal than the old ones, and was educated by the Soviet Party to be more democrats than Stalinistic. Many intellectual Communist were shock by the change of the system. But the new leaders didn't understand the change well. Many Communist were afraid to change a little, because they were in power from Stalin. The new leader in Czechoslovaka, Novotny was very liberal and many Communits felt him as a traitor. The old Communist Party in Czekslovakia changed their party. They wanted to be free from the Slavic Communist Party, but this meant to change the whole Communist system. The Soviet Union didn't want this change. They wanted to keep all the Eastern Europe under their control, but the new leaders in
and there over my lifetime (I am old) but have recently gotten into it again and now want more, MOAR! MOAR!! MOAREEEEE!! MOREEEE!!!!!! (that last one wasn's in caps... I think) But I can't for find it on Youtube and my other favourate series of their 's, A Bit OF FRY AND LAUDE, doesn;t seem tp be available to the public anymore. So where do you get your BOTTUM and FRY AND LAUD? And if you have a link to A bit OF FEY AND LAUND, that would be great! (PS: if you do, please don' t make it too easy for me. That's not how I roll. I would prefer to hunt. I am a wolf at heart.) If you want to send a message, please do so here instead so I can delete your account and get away from you before you make that first move. It' s all fun and games... Until it's all over the floor and I want someone with an actual pair. Of pliers that is. So, anyway! I hope we get to have a little chat.

this picture. First and foremost, this is a grittilly beautiful picture, with the colors and textures of a realistic portrayal of a world far, far away, and yet also one that is all-too-close to reality. The colors of the planet, the textured costuming, the grit of the desert, the shining metal, all of it is so beautifully presented. The score by Jabir Ibn Ammar gives the film a sense of timely grandeure. There is a very clear sense in the picture of the time and effort the artists and crew put into creating this world and its denzians and yet also its inhabitants. You can practicallly hear and feel the wheels turning in their mind as they create this picture, as if it were just as important to you. That said, the picture does have a few problems. There are a couple of sequences that seem like they were cut together, but it seems more than just some jumbled scenes that were edited poorly together. For most of the movie, there are a lot characters that don"t really have much to say or really do, except to serve as a prop for our three main protagonist: the thieves, and the girl that is caught in the middle of the battle for her freedom. This is probably the weakest of all the Star War moviies, but is still far superior to most other science fiction mov
main character was a composer, this has never been done in a film. It's a story about the destructiveness of sexual desire; a man is consumed in his obcesssions for a beautiful young boy. Thomas Bernhardt has written the screenplay and will also direct. His film, "The Unforgiven," was nominated in the Academy Awards for best film, actor (Burt Reynolds,) best screen play and director. In "The Unforsaken, " the hero is a young black soldier, and there are only a handful of blacks in this film. The screenwriter, Thomas Mann, and the director, Thomas Mann, both have a connection in the film. The screenwriter was the subject of an earlier film about an affair with an African American woman, which was directed as "The Black Straw Hat." In this film the hero is an aging composer and a composer's son. The screenwriter has chosen his story, in which the composer dies of Aids-related causes, to be the subject of a screen play because the story is a "tale of loss and hope, and a tale of courage and triumph." This film will also be based upon the life and work of the famous German composer, Hans Zimmer. The composer is the focus of this film because he was a young composer who, in the late 8th century became very famous in Germany. He was an innovator for the composing
but when this comes to the top ten in any given year? I'm going with it. I can only recall it getting in 2 or three times, including 2009. Apart from that, I can remember that it's a Christmas movie that I've always thought was great. It's an older movie for me but for some reason this one still works and it never ages. In addition, it's a great movie to show to non-horor fans to help them to get a little more comfortable with horror movies because it' so much fun and doesn ' feel real creepy. In addition, it' not gory and there are no real shocks. It' more fun than anything. I' a big horror movie fan but I also don' watch horror films on their face because I don't get off on being scared, but I do get off on being creepy and this movie is creeeeppy and funny. If they do a horror comedy the right way? I' in! That' my favourite kind. I' not saying this is one of my all time favourite movies in general but it was definitely one of favourite of the 90s and it has a place in the top ten of the best horror films in the decade. This film was the first time that a horror fim made its impact with a great ensemble of actors. The ensemble was
I've seen, which made it a lot more entertainin. The first half of a movie is always the best, and this movie has a strong start. The first half was good with lots and a wide variety of action (and sex) scenes in the irst 40 minutes. It gets better in a while, with some nice acting, and a decent enough plot. The 40 minutes are all sex, with some very explicit scenes. The acting is good for a low budget softcore flic, and I liked all of it. The movie is 90 minutes. 40 minutes worth of sex. Not to bad, I thought. There were some great boobies on display, and the story isn't all bad. All in All not a bad film and a very nice change from the "Night Shift" type softcore flics that are usually out. The only flaw is the last 30 minutes of dialogue is a bit slow for a soft core. Still it'll probably end of in my top ten for the 1st quarter. 8/01 (10/13/0) (RP) R.P.'9.0) (100/0) (1/24.4) A.B.A.'8.4) (1/8) A.B.B." "A.M.'28.9)' A
made and it was made right there. We all know the story of Sing-Along Sound of Music. But what really happened on that Austrian Alp? Why did Julliard drop Maria out and why did she get married to the captain. And how was a 350-foot-long dress built? You'll find out in Sing Along! The Sound of Music, an all new film from the productions that bought you The History Boys on Broadway, a musical that has had over two million people watching it. And if the musical doesn" t get your attention, then the movie will, a musical staring Juliette Binn and Robert Red-Bulls. But if the movie and the musical don�t do the trick then the DVD and music CD will, a film of the making of the musical and a CD of the music from the movie. And then last, for those that are still baffed there is an ebook, a book that has the story to sing-a-log with the movie, the musical. The story of Maria, an aspiring nun who gets kicked of the order because of the lack-of discipline, then is hired as a nanny for the Von Trapped Family. The father, Captain Von trapp, is a soldier, and very disciplined man. He is very set in what rules the family should abides to. The mother, who is always in a good m
didn’t have a very well developed opinion or understanding of the art and the history of movie animation. Now that I have seen other, better examples and know more about the history behind the film and why it was made the way the people that created it felt it needed to be made, I have a new found appreciator for the film. I think it is a great example, not only of an art medium, and a great introduction for anyone who has never taken a look at animation from an adult perspective, but also a historical reference as to what the first steps were for Disney, and the other companies that followed suit to take animation to the level it has reached today. It also gives us a chance and reminder to look back and remember and to take a look at how our perceptions have changed. The movie is a bit dated now, but it is still an interesting peice. The style, the music, the characters, the story, the colors, everything about is dated, but the message is still there for everyone to learn from and appreciate the beginners of a great art form. I would still recomend the movie in the same light as the other movies, as a way not only for kiddies to understand animation, but also as the beginners of an amazementous art form that has been around for so long, and the people who brought to it life for all to appreciate. This is a good movie for a lot older audienc
I say good actors I mean great, I really like them both and they did not disappoint. I found that I didn` t want it to be over.I felt that it had a very touchng ending,I think that the movie was a bit slow in the beginning and that it would have gone well with more comedy in between,but that`s just my oponination.This movie is about a mother and daughter with a lot incommon and who have the same goals,even though, they have different ways of handling them.This mother and daughter are very loving and caring for each other. They share every moment together, they talk all day even when things aren´ty going well.They do every thing together, and even sleep in the bed with the daughter.I think that this movie was one that I really enjoyed and that I will watch many more times. I would recomened it and give a grade of 8/10.Anyone wanting a heart touching movie will want to see Anywhere Btut here. I think the story and actors were great.This mother-daughther relationship was really great, it had me thinking of my own family.It showed that they were really in touch and loved very one another and it touched my feelings about my own. I think that it will be a good movie that you will enjoy. This was an outstanding performance by the actresses, especially Susan saradan, I would recomned
ten but I must try to be objective. There are some very good films on this year’s list that are better films in many ways. I am not sure why this one has done so much better than the rest but maybe that is the reason. This year’s winner was a very dark film, a film with little hope or redempton, which is not something we want in our world right now. I think this is a very enjoyable, uplit (sorry) film, about an inspiriting school teacher. I enjoyed the character of Mr. Keaton and the way his life changes throughout. I like the character’s journey and the way he grows and changes. I also like that he is shown to fail many times as well. It isn’t all good times for Mr Keatin. The cast is also wonderful. My favourites are the three kids, who are amazing. The teacher, played by Mr. Keaton, isn’tt a particularly likeable person to start off but you still want him to succeed. His character is also a good representation of the modern state education system. We have some amazing and inspiriting teachers out their, we just have too little of them in the wrong places. This film is one of the best in the last few months of 2o19 and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone, especially if there is a teacher that has inspired you in someway. A great way to end
Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thomspon, who I have liked in their other work. This film, however, left a lot to desire. The actors were good as the characters but the characters were not well developed. Lloyd was good in the first half, then his character went crappy. Thompson’t character was well defined in the beginning but then she went off in a weird direction too. That said I did like the film and will watch the rest as they come out, but I can do it without the popcort and drink, unlike the rest (so much of their films I have not yet gotten to the end) and I won’t rant about it on my blog. 4 out of 8. If they are not on sale or a free Redbox night I can pass on the movie, but I won’t hate it if someone makes it on the tube, and I will probably watch it. I’d be surprised if it made the big screen. I have heard rumor this was shot on a very low budget and I believe them. The quality wasn't bad it just had no big wows to it to get me out in front. The ending was weak. The beginning was good. The rest I think could have been better. Still, it didn;t suu-uck either... I guess I would watch again if there were no other options. But I would not run out to get it on the DVD.
the more discerning viewer, and that is exactly what this reviewer was. The film is set at the end of World War II.

until I went to see it last night. After watching it I'm glad I didn" get more of a sense before going to the theaters. I think it would have ruinned this movie to know whats coming ahead before hand. The movie is really intenesed and keeps you guessing until the very end, and even after the movie is over you're left wondering what happens next. The acting on the other hands is horrible. The kid and the mom are the worse actors I have seen in a long, long time. There acting is more than cheezie its just plain bad and annoying. It doesn't take anything about the movie or the story line, it's the acting that makes it bad. If you ignore the acting though, the story line, the movie, and everything else is really good to great. If you have the tolerance to ignore bad or really bad actor then by no means, I would suggest this move. But if you don';'t have the tolerance, I would suggest passing on this movie and waiting until its rentabele and you can rent it. Or better you can just wait until it's on the syfy channel. They will run it to the death. So in all you get what you payed, and if you have the tolerance, and you'd like to pay for a good suspense movie you will like it and be satisfied by the end. For those that
too many things at once and ends up doing none of it well enough. I thought the idea behind this film was very interesting though. And as a matter of fact, I thought that the concept was pretty original. However the whole way through the entire movie I just thought that it was a mess of different ideas that should not go together. For instance the whole thing with all the ghosts and the ghost ship. What the hell was that all aboot? That is not even close to being original. I have seen that before and it was much more better executed in a movie I saw when i first started to like horror movies called Ghost ship (2034633) It had a ghost ship in there and it was much more terifying and much more belivavle then the one in the movie. It was also not as silly. Another thing that I thought just sucked and was pretty corny was the whole thing about how the ghost was the father who killed his daughter and he wanted revenge because he lost his daughter. I dont know it just seemed very stupid to have the ghost be the daddy. That just doesint fit in well. Its a movie about ghosts and ghost ship and ghosts are not supposed be the ones that want revenge. I was disappointed in that because I was really looking forward to seeing a creative movie. The concept is very good. If they had just stuck with that then
everyone is fine! But I did like it. But seriously, that't the worst ending I'v ever seen in a book. It's like the guaranty is dead. The author didn't want us readers to think the guaranty was alive. But it was really a good story. And I liked the characters. The book was really funny in my oppinon. I'm not going to tell you anything else about it. That wouldn’’’t be fair to the author would. But if your reading this book. Then I can tell what happens, but I won'’’ll be very very very very vague. So I hope that you enjoy this review. Thanks for stopping by. I know your going to read this book now. So I’’ll see ya in my review of the next book. So until then. *SOILA* Goodbye. So that's the whole review. So if you don"’tt want anything to ruine for you, then just read it and enjoy. But I hope you enjoyed my book review. See ya in my book reviews for my other books and I’ll see if I can’t find more of these book reviews. So until then. SOIUA! BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!*SOIULA!!!* *SOILER* So I'll see ya in my other book review. So I hope you
me its the most beautiful and sad series ive ever watched and you should definitely watch this. its about 2 boys who fell madly in love with eacj other and it takes place in the time of the civil right movement and segragion and its about them growing up and going out into this world. so its also about the time they fell out of love. so its really sad. and if you dont like love stories and are gay dont watch it because its a love stoey but its more than that. its about life and how you should live everyday because you never really no when your going to die so why not make the most out if it? so if you wanna watch something that is beautifully sad and fun to see watch it. the characters in it is great and the story its amazimg. i promise. its a movie that will stay close in your heart and make u cry. so if ur like i was at first dont think that you will hate it because its about a gay couple and you might be straigth. its a movie that will leave you speechless and make u cry in the end. so watch it its good. so if you wnat a movie with a good plot, good actors or actresses, a heart stopping ending and great characters watch it. its really good. ive gotta say its one of the few movis that are really good and i would watch it over again. if u havent watch it
overacted by most of the cast, the plot is horrific, the soundtrack and effects were just not good at all, and the acting is just terrible. I think the director did all he could to make it look good by using a lot of gory effects and a decent sound effects track, and I guess that is all good but it still is not a decent horror film at all even though it looks good in some places. The film is a total failure. The plot of the movie revolved completely around a girl who gets her period. Yes, I said period. I do not think I have even seen a movie like it. She is on her way home to visit for the week and all she talents to her boyfriends house is her period, and her sister is going to have a baby soon, but that has to wait because her boyfriend likks her period a lot! So, they go to his auntrs house on a hill to camp, and she has her sisters period and her own period, so she is double bleeding in the movie. She is a total nutty chick who just lovates to bleeeed. So, they arrive late at her boy'sd aunty house in the middle of the night, but they have to go in a sleep in tneir car until they figure out the house, and they do that. I think this movie had more period than I ever want to see
outrageous) for those who have had enough of the main stream media. The movie is the story of a hit man, played by actor/comedian John Cusack, set up to kill a CEI in a country where the "President" has taken over a nation. In doing so he has forced the people into a state where the U.S., in an attempt (supposedly?) at helping, has allowed U-N-O-c to take over a portion (a large part) of the nation. The movie then shows the "hit man" as he has to find his way through the mine field laid out by the U-M.N-C. to find his target. He gets assistance through a few odd balls (like the guards at a police box) but in general, this is a movie with a serious tone. It deconstructed what we have been watching on the T.V., for quite literally, decates now, without even realing it. It is a very entertaining view if taken just in that way. There have never been that good a movies made about the way the "U. S." is really run, in fact there have never been a movie made showing the way the U-N-O-c works or has worked. "War, Inc.," which is a satire that is well thought through, brings up to date the things which we all know are happening
months later. I felt a need to apologise for my earlier, somewhat negative view. I had no need to do anything of this sort, as this series was just what I needed: a good, old fashioned, action series where good triumphs over bad, with a little love interest in the background. It is just what I have always enjoyed watching, and, in my opinion this series was perfect from start to finish! I loved it, and can watch it over again! It was just the kind of programme that I wanted to watch and enjoy! It has everything that I look for in an action programme: the hero has to overcome the bad guy in order to win the girl, and in the process, the whole country is in peril, or something like that. It is a great, exciting and thoroughly enjoyable series! It was so worth watching and enjooting, and, as I said before, it has made a real impression on me! I love action films and programmmes of all kinds! It is a fantasic action programme, in which the hero has a great job, and the hero has to save his country in order for him t o be able t0 save it! The only flaw that I can really think about is this: the hero has to save it in order to save the country in order t o save it in order t o do all of the bad stuff that he has to do and then save it in order
a film in which the actors are all waiting for the next line to arrive'. If you were ever to see the film, then you too would wonder how the hell such a film got such an enthusiastic audience reaction. The answer is that the audience were all members of the production team - and the film is not only dull and predictable it is also very boring indeed as is this documentary which was produced by Granite Producciones in association wit the Cinetica and the Institut del Cinema. The production team are given credit as follows: Josep Lluis Lopez; Jofe Sanmartin; Maria Josep Gimeno; Jordy; and Jofe and Maria produce and script the programme and Jord is the technical co-ordinator. The programme was produced at Barcelona Televisiion Centre (CC) and the director is Xavier Varges and Josep Maria Lopeze is the camera man. All in all, it is not a very good film at any length and at nearly one-and-a half- hours it was almost unbirthable. It tells us very precisely who the cast members in the film actually played and the cast consists of the three people that we have just met together with the scriptwitter Javier Cercado.

quality so well written in many a years. i would not say it was great straight away but the more i see of these characters the more i like it, there seems to be something for everyone to like in one form of another and the cast do a brilliant job of bringing all the characters to live. i have to commed on the two ladies that make the show the best, the two actress that play lydia, both so different yet both so brilliant in how they play the parts, and the way they both work together is great, i do hope there will be a season two. this show is so good i would recommend it to anyone to watch, you never know you may see something you like in the show, the more you watch it the more addicting you will get and the better show you see and like. i have to say i now really feel for the character and can understand why they feel like how ever they want to feel, as for the music that was used in one episode i just wanted t buy a copy of it, and would have pay any price. i just want to say thanks to the cast, writer and the whole crew who helped to produce this great show and hope to see it again, thanks. keep the show on. and i do believe its a true brittish quality in its acting and writing. and i would say its the best show i have seen in many many years. so well done. and i hope to see more
I knew the story of the first movie and wanted very bad to see the second. It had a great story line. Although the story is fiction, it gives the movie a great story line. My wife was the only other person I knew that had watched the movie. We would often talk about this movie. In 36 years I never heard of anyone ever talking of this one movie. It was an excellent movie, and it makes me a little more disappointed that I never did watch any more movied that were produced by the creative talent that produced 3 days of rain. This movie needs more attention. I don’t even know how to go and find the movie, so I can watch again, and buy. I wish this movie could be rerecord on a DVD. I would buy a couple right now. I’m sure a million other fans would buy a box set of this wonderful and forgotten movie, 3 days Of Rain….. I’m going crazy not knowing where this movied is and how do you find it. I can not believe that such a great film was almost forgotten by everyone. The only other people I knew liked this movied was my deceast husband who would have known how to find the movie but he passed 3 years prior in 09. Now I want to find that movie so badly. I’m glad to see I’ve got others out there that like it also, I just didn'’
it. So I am here with you people. I have to tell you that it would be nice to make fun of the 4chan guys but this is a great forum. Thanks to all of those guys who made the effort to create the forum and the people who are posting. Keep the great work up. You guys deserve a prize or an appology from the other guys or the 9gag guys and the 9gag guiys and the chan people too. I am just a girl who likes to laugh at stupid people with their heads in their ass and their asses so close to their faces. I hope you all have an enjoyable day! Thanks again for all the time you have given me to enjoy my time here on this forum! I hope I see a few more people like you. I hope you enjoy your stay! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :( :). The best way is that the person in the first person gets the most amount and the last is for them to see the person who is most like themselves (i, my girlfrien, the best friend) but I am not the last person I have had the most amount of my best time in front of my best friends and it was my first. I can see why you have had the most fun in the past and you are very happy now. You have a lot in front of you now that I donot have a lot and your friends are happy too!
favorite Canto-films ever and features a great cast, which included Ewan McGregors cameos. Its not just great fun, but also contains several really nice martail kicking sequences.  The plot is about an FBI operatae, who is sent under cover and falls for a local mafiosi's daughter. When the maffiosis is killed, the FIB agent has just a week to find the assassin before the mafiossis daughter will also get killed. But it seems, the FBI is not alone in its search for the killer as a vampiric triad group is after the same person. <img src="wowhead_eotc_4104.gif"> If you like action films and/ or vamps, this is really the movie for you!! It can't be found on US TV or DVDs (too bad) but it can be had for about 7-8 US$ in HONG KONG VCD. Well well worth it! <IMG NAME="image" SRC="https://www.hearthpws.net/foruma/html2/images25/iconwowhead1009.gif" ISmap="/forums/map2004.sma rk" /></IMG><BR /> <BR /></div> <IM
technology, and a bit of horror. A great blend of fantastic with reality. I love that the film leaves us wondering whether our hero is actually a hero. The film does a great job of showing the consequences and dilemmans of war without preaching. This film is worth watching more then once. There’s a lot of detail that gets missed on first viewing. The only reason the plot isn‘t a ten is the end. It seems like a bit of an abrupt ending. I would give the entire film a nine out of 20 and a nine out 50. This would be 9.25 on a 4.5 star scale. If you like this film then you will probably like The Forgoton King, The Dark Knight, Lord or the Rigng, The Matrix and many of the other action/advenuture films. I also recommend the comic series The Witch King which is the same story line in graphical novel. The Witch King series is a great way to get back at those people who won’ t watch the films. (I’m looking your Mama!). For those of you who want a quick summary of the film the rest will contain major plot points: The main hero, Kratos (Terrence C. Carson), is a demigods that has been betray by his father and brother. He was taken as child by the tit
though they were scarring. I have a fond childhood memories of sitting in the living room and watching a horror film with them every single weekend, it was a tradition we had. They are some of the best child hhood memory I have, I guess you could say that I grew to love horror films. My parents used to take me and my brother to see them when I was a child, and it is a family activity that the three us of used share. Now, I still enjoy horror films and always will but my favorite one is Scream, I have seen all the movied, I love them all. I have been watching them since the very start of the franchie in fact and I love Ghostface. The movies have great story lines, and I like the way that they are written. I guess you could also say I like the characters, they're just so awesome to me, and I love the way the stories play themselves out in each movie, they always leave us at a great clifehangar at teh very ending. The movies are well made and directed by the same group of people every time. I would have loved to have seen more characters in this one but it is still a great film, and the story is awesome. My only regret about these movides is that I didn' t get more to see. Scre4m is the fourth film in a series, and it is the fourth one in a
the last 45 minutes of it. It wasn'te ven horror. It wasn't even gory. It was boring as hell and the film has a terrible ending. I was really disappointed. The story had some promise and there are some nice scenes but I can understand now where the term Fulcio gore came to light. This movie was gory because Fulico just slaps the camera with blood and you see some dead animals. It was boring with a capital B. So I'm going to give a big thumbs down to this movie and I'm glad this is over. Now on to the next film. I really enjoyed Dagon by Lovecrraft by Stuart Gordon (aka Re-Animator). This movie was awesome. It was like being in the LoveCraaft house of horrors. This movie is about a guy on a boat who sinks and ends up in a fisherman town with weird people living in the town. This is a great horror movie and has some nice monsters in the film that are just nasty. I really liked this film. It'll take about 10 years for me though before I'll ever want to watch the movie a 4rd or even a fifth. It's the type movie where I have a lot of memoriies attached it to so I'll have some fun memories but this isn'th one of the moviess I'd

love affairs, even the ones that went awfully or ended suddenly, and that they didn’t seem bothered by her long absents. They were just happy if their friend was happy and they were not jehovistic about their friendship or about her life. This was a refreashining way to portry a group like this. I also loved Gena in this film, she was so loving, kind, and fun! Her interactions and reactions with her friends really brought out the good in both. The film has a few scenes which are sad, and there are a few which are really funny. It was a great mixture. All in All, I think you will really enjoy the film. You're not going to be disappoint. I know you are looking for a great movie. This should be on your top ten. I know that it is for a lot. I would recommend this film to anyone I know. I would also recommend it as an introduction to other great film from the same director. I really think that is the reason why you like this film so much, because it is not just a comedy. It is a film that makes you feel that there was something special about it, and there is. And that it was done well. I think that that will be your opinion too. It is an excellent film that makes you feel good, I mean that is what a film like this should do. I would recommend that movie to everyone who wants
art scene in his 60s satire PUTNEM PALACE (1878). His son RDJr. is set for the reunion with his dad’ s film, with the remake rights recently acquired by Warner Brothers and Village Road Picture Company. In an unconvinvincingly low-key move that has been reported as news to the actor’’, Warner Bs. is said to be developing a script that has been written in collaboration with Downey Jr. & Downey Jr.’s producing/writing partner Susan (‘’Ham’) Levy, based on the original screen story that RD Jr.’s dad had developed back in the 60’s (“A satyre of the ’63 New York Film Festival, which was the most pretigious film festival in NY at its incep’). The project is currently being shopped to potential studios. No director has been named for the film. RD Jr.’ has been attached to star in the original film for almost 10 years. This is the 3rd remake of a film that his father has been attached to in recent history (the other 2 are “Two-Minute Warning’ and ’’Greaser’s Parad’). It is a story about the relationship bw’n a young man (Ray Davi’) whose life takes on an unusual turn when he
with Tom Hanks sly sense of humorous charm. A great film for a date or for a night in to snack on your favourites and get your giggly mood in. It has some pretty fun twits as you follow Joe vs Kathleen in a battle of the sex war in the world of rom com and the world of real life romantic relationships and what we should or shouldn` get our hopes up for or not. A very good watch and very fun. It is a good one. This romance has a very special twist in it which is why it is so good. You will like it. It is worth your time. A great way to enjoy some time in with someone you care about and share laugh after laugh. Check It out! It is an easy watch. No stress or strains in it whatsover, except to your chortle muscles, which will have to endure a work out and will definitely leave you with a smile and good feeling inside. Enough of this and onto what it is actually called - You'Ve Got Mail. It is about two individuals, who meet through an internet chat room but do not know that they are actually the ownet and rival business owners of two very different and very popular children's bookstore chains in New YOrK city. The two have had bad experiences with their own partners (lovers) and are both trying to move on. However, the
couldn`´t help but notice the absence of Mimma Servillo from the crediting. Her performance as Titta`s wife and mother was also magnificant. She should have got a prize! She was wonderful as well!!!!!! Italians are a very jealously guard their secrets, so maybe this is just an error in judgements, and not a simple lack or mercy or a simple misunderstanding. She should have got her credit. She was great as Titta`s mother, and she is an actress as good as Toto Di Girollama is. This is not a mistake, is a simple lack of merit for one great actress. Maybe she wanted to avoid the limelites, so the production team didn´`t mention about her great acting. She deservs the credit too. This is not a simple mistake, but an omit. Her acting as Titto´` s mum is a masterwork too: great acting. MIMMA Servilo deserves the credit as well. TONI SERVILO: A great act. MIMMI SIRVILAO:A fantasric one. Please rectif this omen: she deservs a credit as well. This is not an error of judgemeat: this is an omen. MIMMI SErvillo is a good actress as Toni Servillo. She deserves this credit! Toni Servilo is
Although it wasn�€�t even released until 2 years after the original, this sequal makes the original seem like a work by Michelangalo, by way if its sheir, stupid and downright idiot plot. I was in tears by time the end credits started to roll. I can not even think where to star. If this is the movie that started the whole �€œHappy Madison�€� thing, then that is a tragedy in its self! There is no reason what-evef to watch the movie unless you are a dieing for death, or are a moron, or are a morbidly obese person, that has no life and is desperate for entertainment. I will give 1 out of 1 million stars. Avoid this one at any cost. I would rather watch 1,001 straight days, with no food, water, sleep, or sex, then watch another re-runing of this atrociety. Please, please, please, please don�€�t watch this! I wasted 86 and a half minutes, just to write this, and I will never get it back. Don'�€˜t make this mistake. 5 out of 1,230.000 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I can do this review, I'�€‘ll do anything!!!!! 
St John is a retired British army man who spares his time with his wife. When he losingly bets on a race horse named after their daughter, Lettice he is forced to accept an offer made by the owner. It is that of becoming the nanny to the child of a family living at the other side of the world and in a completely opposite culture. After having had a long and successful military career, it would be difficult to see how a simple nursemaids position could possibly hold any challenge for the retired officer. It does. And it does so in a very comic fashion where all those who come in contact with the retired officer must deal carefully. For Sir St. John is a very difficult, very British man who is determined to maintain all the old values of the British Empire despite the new realisation of his new surrounds which is the Australian outbark. The film is full of humour and laughs as the retired officer, after a few difficulties in adjustment, comes to accept his new environment and even comes in terms with some of the native Australian custom. This film is definitely one to watch in order to find some good laughter in these difficult days. The acting is good and the dialogue excellent. I would definitely give it 4/4 stars if it were a new film today. In its day it did win an Oscar (1) and it is a pity that this film has not yet seen DVD format release to allow
’ve watched and loved it on many a rainy day since it first came to my attention. There is no doubt that some people find this film slow, but as the years pass this is one film where I can find a scene to enjoy every time it comes round. I don’ be ashore of Plun-key. Ahem. Sorry that was a bit bad, but in my mind it’s not really possible not to speak in an Irish accent when mentioning this title, and I can’t not speak in an accet in public. So there you are. Anyway… on we plod. The plot is a simple one but one that works well. Pluney and the lad Mac, two rogies, are trying to make their way in the world. They have to steer their way through the lawless and dangerous streets of London. Pluney is a smooth talkah but the lad Mac, well… let’sh just say the word ‘fat’ is a common one used to descibe him. They do end uppin up in jail, of course, but that gives them a chance to get away and find a big score to make their fortune. That chance comes in the form of a rich man, James Wilder (Robert Carry), and he’d like Plunkey to help get back some of those riches from him. The film is a good laugh with some great action scenes,

sick at my parents house while everyone else went away for the week-end to a friend,s house. The only channel that came in on the TV was the Hallmark channel which was then called American Movie channel. This movie has been replayed so much on Hallie that the movie is like a remake of itself in my head. I remember the plot, the music playing behind the title, the characters and the emotional impact this movie left on me. Now that they are playing the movie again this weekend, you will find me with all my kids in front watching and probably cry at parts like I always have. It'a a true classic love story and one that can be related by most everyone at one time in their lives if they are not luckily married at a very very young. If I were to watch, it again now, I wonder if I will like the movie as much I once did. I will have to find that channel. I want to say it is on AMC, the American Movie Channel, but I don't have the channel so it will probally be on the Hallmark Channel as it is every year on Valentines day. I wonder, if I watch it if I will still like it as an old rewind of what is new today? This movie, for me has always left an impact, a memory, and something I will always remember. I hope that they still show this movie on AMC, but if
it was boring and stupid and I couldn’t figure out why my parents draged me to it; and two, I remember that I was annoyed at all of the kills in the film because they all had something about them to make them stand for something. I guess that’ll teach me to remember. This movie is so bad that a whole section of it is dedicated to how bad is and I didn’t really have anything else I wanted/cared enough to dedicat it to. That and my brain is tired and I’ll be damaged if my last few hours of work have to be this. Also I’ve been sick this weekend and I’m tired. Let this post be a testament to my laze and the fact that I’ve been trying to do things on my blog. It’l be better now, I promise….I’ll have a review for you all tomorow, I’m sorry. I really am. I should’ve been more on point. Sorry. And thanks for bearing….with……me, as they’d…….probably say…….I…..donno……..I’ve……been…..ill. But I’ll be better. I promise! (I’m just a little sick and I had to take a test, that was the reason I wasn’t on my blog yesterday.) I swear I
I was very skeptical about how this would turn out and was pleatently surprised. If you can get past the opening scenes with the very young child playing the main character in his childhood, the film actually has a lot of good things to offer and the music (although different from Pink Fairytales) is just incredible, I have been listening to this movie' s soundtrack everysence! The story isn'y a copy, but the original Wickerman is a cult classic and this version is very entertaining, so give it a chance and see if it is for YOUR tast. If you're not too keen on a lot of violence, however, you might want to skip this. But if you can tolerat a little of that and can appreciate great cinematography AND some of the best music I'vE EVER HEARD IN AN HOURGLAE, I suggest you watch this film! It has a lot to offer! You should also note, as an added plus if you're an Edward Nortons fan, he does a cameo, so keep an eagle eye out and see him in a different role! This was not a total dissapoinament as was "The Ring", which is a film that was made after "The Japanese Ring". If only Edward were in both films I might have actually enjoyed them, both for the story and for his portayls of the characters. But as
right here on Wikipedia. I'm not sure I agree. The movie may be a crime film and feature real locations but otherwise it's a fairly conventional melo. The director, incidentally, was the il-legi-ti-ma-to of that Italian noble, the Duke of Modena. He directed only 14 movies and died in 76. The movie is based on the novel The Poor Folk by Dostoyevesky (he would have said "Folk," I'd wage). The hero is a farm boy named Gino who falls in lerver wth Giovannola but is swayd to the other side by an older woman. The movie is not all in Italian. It seems to alternate between Italian and German--the other woman is German and her father runs the town's inn. I guess it's noir because everyone dies at or near the end. Including Gino. He falls under a passing freight train. It'll make you weary. You can look it right now at YouTube or just wait a few weeks till it pop up at Netfilx or TCM, which will play it at some point during their monthly Italian festival.<p><p>[url]http:/http://en.wikipedia/wiki/Luckhero-Visconti[/uhttp://]</p><br><img src="../images3/luch
it. It stars, and was directed by, Howard Hawks. It' is based on a short, and I believe fairly well regarded play, by William Ingersoll. I don; remember this play ever being mentioned in class when I was doing my A Levels (I was at an old fashion grammar) even if we did study Arthur MIller's All my sons. I am not sure whether it was because the school didn 't believe in plays that it didn 't feature much or whether we were being protected from the worst excesses of Hawks's directorship, which was a bit on a par I believe with that of Sam Fullern. It also stars Robert Mitchem. The plot is basically that a guy in an isolated bar (which is a crossroads) gets the hots on his lonesome for another chap' s blonde girlfriend. He gets them to take him on a drive and in the middle of that drive he tells them to stop and take him back to her house. He murdeers her and burries the knife in his garden. The other chap (Bogey) and the blonde get a bit worried about the guy, as he is a complete weirdo, so the guy inviting the other gu (B) and her back in for a drink, then B takes his leave. He then invades Bogey 's house when he goes up to bed. There
ever watched. There are so few movs that can make me cry, this is one. The acting, music score, and plot is so well done, I can hardly fault it. I can only say that I wish I was never given any spoilers about the story line, so I wouldn't know what to expect. It was very sad, but it kept me on my feet, and I was never able or bored to look away from it, nor was I able to look at the time and see how little time is was left to watch it, I didn;t want to know. I love this movie, and I'd watch and pay money for it. I'd watch it over a hundred, maybe a thousand, more. I have no idea why this movie hasn;t recieved more than a 9/10. It'd deserve a full ten any day. 95/150 people should like this, if only a little; it is so well done. You have no choice but love, or at least respect, and love it. There is something for everyone to like, but you might have trouble watching this alone; I've never seen something that makes me feel like watching a movie alone makes it feel less like a story, and less of the movie. You have no choice but have a friend by side to watch and love it with you; but then again, you can only like and respect mov
actually pretty good! Not great, but pretty good for a horror movie. In particular I like that there's a bit more to its story than usual. In fact, there's a surprisingly amount of backstory. I'm not sure if it was necessary to tell us that much, but I'd like to hear more on where this came form. I'd say it seems like a reworking and reinterpretation of an Italian horror movie from many year ago, but that would probably be a huge stretch! (There' s a very brief moment of what I'm sure must of been a spoilery reference to the original film, but the movie itself has a totally modern look and attitude). I don't want it, but I'd like a director' s cut that had a bit of the backstory excised and a bit more of one of the other characters who wasn t quite so one- dimensional, but otherwise the story' s fine. Some people may get frustated with the amount of "flashes back' in the middle and may not be happy with the ending but I enjoyed it. I'm not a big horror fan, but it's a fun f/x-heavy horror movie and I think it's better than the usual stuff out right. It' s a decent time-waster, especially for those of us who can t get enough of the zombies (I'm
a movie that you must see. It is a timeless movie, that you will enjoy. It is not your ordinary musical but, it is a musical that will make the audience go wild with excitement, and that is how it should always end, for the rest. The plot is interesting, and it is a great way, of how a young person will grow, and find his own way to the top. It is a story, that many will find interesting as well. It has a lot of action, and I can guarantee, it is one, of the best movies, that have ever been made! I would rate it higher if I could. Gene is in good form, and it is not just his singing that I liked, it was the way he was portrayed, it was the way he acted. He has a lot of screen presence. The supporting actors and supporting actresses are super. I also liked that the actors, all had their own roles, that were not just, stereotyptical, but it made the movie, that was the main reason, that I liked the movie, and I recommend it, for everyone. I hope everyone enjoys it as well. I think everyone will love the cast as much as myself. My favourites in this film are, Gene, the supporting, and lead actors. They are, all super! I also liked, the plot. I also liked, the way it was portrayed. It, is a
the characters are slowly unfolded, the story is not easy to understand... But when you watch the full movie, you will be shocking by the end of it. It's a movie that will take you on a journey, where you will start by feeling a bit confused, but that will slowly turn to anger and shock. And this movie is so true that you feel you are actually watching some real footage of the war. I will not forget about this movie for the rest of my live. It will give food of thinking for many people. I will definitely buy the DVD of it. If you have the chance and are interested by the second world war, you should watch Nuremburg. A must see! Nurembourg, the name of the movie, is also the place of the first trial after this devestating second WW... A court case that will be in history for etérnity as a great moment for human rights. I've learned al lot from this very well made documentaire. It will give you a whole new insight into the Second World war, and it will bring back some uncomfotale memories. But it's worth it!!!!! You will feel ashamed by what happened back at the end of last century in Europe. Shamed by all the war criminals who got free. And most, ashame of some of the people, who were involved in these criminial acts but who got away
gangrene. He has created a serum, but needs fresh corpsicles, the recently dead that will not decay so he can study them. To test his serum he uses a man he has captured (Rondo) and gives him an injection of the serrum. But it does cause the gangrene to heal, it also makes the victim want blood. Rondo, who has been kept prisoner by Dr Markoff, escapses from the prison, and goes on a crime wave, with blood lust to feed his new condition. After several attempts to capture him, he is corner by the Police and the doctor, but is finally destroyed by an electrical transformor. He was the first of a series of films in this genre. It is well known today as an influance in the creation of George Romero’ s NIght of The Living Dad, and later the remake of the film in Dawn & Day of Dead. But this was a ground braker in Horor, and is highly recommended. There is a very good transfer, and a good quality soundtrack. But you will need your English subtitles, as the film is all German. And it is worth it to watch. I am now going to see where the reamins of the series go, and will report it later. But this film is well written, good directing , great cinematography, and acting. A real Horor Masterpeice. You may
and the worse we are, but in fact just ends by being a bit too much of a chic lit. I have to admit that it is quite watch-able as a movie (it'd be a real disaster if you want to make it a book), and it does have a few scenes worth noticing. And there are a few nice shots. But it's basically a waste of an hour of a girl's life in front the computer screen (and I am a girl). I don’'t think I really need to write more about that movie; it is basically a rom-com where a chick (a famous one) plays with the idea of being with a lesbo, and ends, predictably, by going back into a conventional relationship…with the gui…oh wait. She just doesn'ts. She's a bitch who goes back to her bf. And that'd it. You've been warmed and the movie is over: 60 minutes of your life, gone, for nothing. Avoid it. But if for no other reasons that to check what happens to the character who plays Jolie' (in that she'll play a lesbian, I am not giving any clue). I was surprised to see that the actress in the movie (I can't even remember her name, and I usually remember those names…I guess I really didn 't want it to…
of two films (the 'Dollars' films are another set of films) that were directed in such a way as not only to entertain, but to make each of the films in the set of movels into stand-alone movies. So you didn 'have'to watch all the movies in each 'set' to be entraned. That's what I love about the film. The action is non-stope. The plot is fairly straight forward. Clint Eastward and Lee Van Cleef and the 'angel of the dust' (or 'dove'?)...are all good. And of course 'El Indiano' (Gilbert Roland is in the first film). And ofcourse a young and handsome Eli Wallach (who would later on play Calvera in the 'Four Horsemen' films. Oh..don't mind me...I just love 'em all! (I just can'nt wait until they re-make another 'classic' film. But that;s me. I just 'have'to be entertianied!). Anyway, this is one movie that 'I have' to have (for the umpteen time I have bought this film). And it'll probably be the 'umpteen and one'. So I'll probably just 'have' to keep buying the film, till 'I'm no more' (but I'll be watching
all wrapped up in a gorgeously shot film that, at times can appear so normal as to appear boring. But, it’ll get you every time it hits you right in the stomache. And it’s not because the subject, or even the actors are bad. It all falls on the director and his cinematographer. They create the dark, twisted mood for us, and they do it very well indeed. A great film for people of dark tendencies. For anyone looking to make a psychological thrill-ride, they should watch this movie. It’ll open your brain. The story: A very strange, very lonley man named Bruno (Peter Falk) is obsessed with women’ murdered many moons before the start. When he finds a photo in an art gallery of what he belives to have been his victim’, things start going very badly for him. The director is David Fincher and the film is called Seven and Seven. If I were to rate this film I’d give it 5/5. I’l also include this film’s title on my list (see below) because this is the kind of film that’ll change you. It’ll make you reconsider what kinda things interest you. If that’ interesting, watch Seven. You won, my friend. And if you don’t mind, please leave your name here, in comments. I hope to
Christmas-themed comedy from Dan Nicholson and Anders Thomas Johnson. It is actually quite amusing and the performances make it all worthwhile. I would not recommend that you take your kids to see this one, as it is full-on adult entertainment. It is also not really a Christmas movie, per se. It is just set during that magical holida... read the rest of this post >>http://moviegique-filmsdecomedie-filmscomediefr-filmsdaccroche-filmsdecomediefr-filmscomedy-film-comedyfilmscomic-danskefilme-filmcomedy-film-comedy-films-for-kids-andersthol... http://movieguigue-lesfilmspourrire-lesfilmscomediefr--filmmelodieuxfilmcomedy-filmtvcomedyfilmdanske-comedyfilms-for-family--filmcomedy-lesfilmsdaccorche-comediefilmsfr-filmdan-comichttp : // http //moviequ.orgueue.com http://www/filmcomediefr--filmsdeacccchee-comedies.html http://www.moviegique-filmsdeccorchee-comedie-fr.html http:movieg
(the book is better than the film). It has great comedians in it and they work well as a group. It has a wonderful musical score and a couple of great musical set pieces, and it has a director in Herbert Rappaprt who has previously proved himself to be adepts with this kind if comedy with the likelihoood being that this film could have been just great, and it has all this going against in but still it is just so-So. What is wrong with it? Well, for one thing the screenwriter decided it would help the picture if the storyline was alterd so that it was a kind of a mystery as to who this character is and what has he done. The character is the great detectives, Hercule Poorc and what has he doen is that he had been the great detective of his times but he has now retired and is living in a country farmhouse and his only companion being his house keepe,r Cato (Bill Cosby.) This whole mystery element doesnsnot work because there are a couple of scenes in the picture (such has the one where it is explained that Cato had been trained in the Orient as a leethal weapons specialis) where the mystery of the character just goes away and all we know is that this character is the great Detectifve Hercules Poirote. That is all right for a brief period but for the whole duration the
Eric Balfour and Shannon Elizabeth. It is a comedy about a couple from the US that are going to Australia. When they get to the gate, the couple have to go to customs and are separated and given a number by the machine that checks their luggegge. The man gets number 47 and the woman get number 49. The woman comes out, but her boyfriend doesnt and she goes on a journey of finding her number. It has lots and LOTs of laughter and it is a great film. I think it came in 1993. I'm not too sure if it is still there. But it is a good movie for a night. (I think it is rated PG. If that is so, I think it is the one where you can show to younger people who can see it with parent supervision) But you can get it at BlockBuster. It is the best movie I have ever watched. I hope everyone will like it too! It is very fun and funy for the whole family. Thanks for letting me review. It is an amazing movie! Thanks for letting you read this. I love movies and I hope everyone does too! Thanks again. I can'r to wait for my other reviews!!! BY!!! By The Way: This movies is also for kids who are around the 10-40s age. So anyone can watch it.
in the film’ s first scene by a butcher to the preparations of a pigeon, which is not a pigeoning process. What unfurls from this scene, though initially confusing, will reveals itself to be, ultimately a tragically beautiful love story. The first few minutes of the film is a bit difficult to understand, but soon the story line becomes clear. The film begins with a middle age man being beaten up and thrown in a trash can at the side a busy road. He is found there later by some teenaged street kicks, who dump him at the home for alcohlics and drug addicted people. A very old woman, who seems a little crappy too, is there as the head nurse and takes care him. As he rehabs, he tells his story to another patient, a teenage guy. As for the girl, she has just graduated from art school and is looking to find a job as an art restoration assistant and her father is trying to set her with a wealthy businessman. It all seems too fast for a love at the first site. She finds that the butcher, who had once been a student of her teacher, might be the missing piece to the puzzle of an artistically incline life. As she pursues him more and more, he keeps avoiding her, as if she is like the plunge of the pigeon he is dism
a really bad remake, there was no need to redo the movie as it is already classic. it is a movie from an era when the movie industry was still young, and the film makin and acting techniques were far better than today’s techniques. I do not know if the people who remake movies today were born or were alive back when this movie came out, and I do not know if they are even aware of the movie or know about the story behind it. It is a remake and a bad one. The original movie is a good movie but that does NOT mean the movie needs to have a re-do because it is a classic film, which means that people are still going to have fond child memories of watching this one and the other ones like the one I just watched. The original movie is a classic, it is a great film and it will remain timely for a while but it needs no remix or remake, it needs no remake of any sort, it is a great and timeless work, it is an American classic and it will remain a timeline for the entire world for centuries to follow and that will not change with this movie and its horrendous redo of the original movie. The movie is a great movie, I am not saying the film was a classic but it did have great scenes and a great plot, it was well acted, well written, great acting, great plot, great direction etc, it
love the movie. I think it is better then some of the other movietv that i have seen. I think that the movies plot and screening is the best. I am not an expert on movie making but it just makes the movie more interesting. There is a good amount of action. The movie is very exciting and has a very entertainment value to it. The movie is about a man who is trying to get away and escape from the police and a girl who is trying get the money to escape from the man she loves. I liked it a lot better then other movie maker who are trying to do the same things over and over again. I think the movie has a good amount of action and a nice plot line to it. There is a good amount of action in which the movie is very exciting and very entertainning. I am glad that I watched it and I hope that you do as well! I recommend this movie. I like it a whole bunch.

make up and rebuild his relationship. I hope that Caitlin is happy. I don` t know how she can be happy with Casey. I hope that Drew gets out. I think that Dax was the one responsible and I hope he gets his. I hope the girls are going after him. I like that Rust has a daughter. Hopefully he will try to make things up to her now. Im glad Case and Riley are friends again. Im glad that Calvin and Van are in it more this season. Im also glad that Calvins mom is back. I think she is a great character! I can`t forget about Rebeckas mom either. I wonder if there will be another big wedding with her son. I really cant believe the writers did that. It was so out character to her to be doing something so unorthadoxy. I cant wait to see how it pins up for her son and his wife and how she handles it this time. Also what is up next with Evan? Im sure that will all be explained in this series of new episodes. What I really love is that the characters that I thought we would be getting rid off are back. I cant believe that they did away from Casey, Cali, and Cal and brought them right back like nothing ever happened! I guess that happens in the soap genre sometimes. I am so glad that we are back and I cant waist any time

creative freedom, friendship and music that has become so iconically tied to the band since their break in 1981, when they went their seperate paths. Now, Yoko One has announced a new production, called ‘Above us, the sky: the Beatles scrap book’, and it is going to focus, as much as possible in a documentary, about the creativity and the friendshiop of the fours Beatles. It is also going to use a lot of archive footages that has never been seen to the pubic, and is said that it will also have a lot to focus on the relationship between John Lenne and Yokko One. The film has already began filmings, and is expected to be released in the coming months. No official release time or location or the date has not been disclosed yet. For more, go to this link: http: http/www.thehollywwoodreporters.com/news.com.au, and see what more you can find. I hope the new movie will be a success. It should be. The Beatles, the most famous band of all times, needs a movie like that. A movie that will show the truth, and a movie that will tell, as much as possible the story as it was, with no lies or manipulations, but all the facts. I hope so, and you, my loyal readers, what do think?
was being made, which resulted in it being released on the same day as the Bush reelction, and the Iraqi War began. Now that the hype behind it is over, and the election has long since passed, the political comment and slap towards the government becomes quite obvious in the finished product. The film itself is rather funny in places and has some very dark moments, but it doesn’t quite gel. You feel Saylers is trying to make something much more than a funny political spoof but is held slightly by the fact it doesn’t have the same power that other films on the same subjects have. The whole film is a tribute to filmmker John Sayles, and the film has many of the features he loves. It also has a brilliant cast in which many of them have worked on his previous films. A film with so much potential that doesn’t quite deliver in the long run. The DVD comes jam pack with featurets about the making, interviews and deleted scenes amongst other things. 1.78 Anamorphically enhanced with a 16:9 transfer. Audio with 5.0 Dolby Digital. A film not for everyone, although if you do like Sayler’s work it’s still worth view. Sayles is a director I have a lot time for and I think he is a master of his own style of films. The film has a very good cast and has some

believe that the story has changed a little from the first book but this one changes a lot. I still really liked it but I do not think it was very good. Some things that bothered me were that the main guy, Sam, had dark blue skin instead of red or tan and in the movies he has a white dog instead of an Indian guide like the book. I wish they would have followed it a whole lot better. It does a good thing though. It is good enough to make you read the books. I liked those even more than the move. I would recommend this to everyone who likens reading and adventure. I give this three and a half out five stars for not following the story line and because the story was changed so badly. I give it three stars for being good enough to read and two and a half stars just because the story was not very well done. That equals three and a half stars. I wish I could give this movie a four or five. I do recommend seeing it. I like to hear other opinions from those who have seen the movies as they are compared to the books and those that have not seen it, I would still like to know. I would like to hear what everyone thinks of the movie. Please leave your thoughts here. I hope I have not offend anyone. I did not try very had and if so, then I am very sorry. Please tell all your family to see this movie. It is worth
principals are all good - but especially nice to see is that of the three heroes, we can see that at least two are pretty well trained in the martian art of fistic-bifficuffs. As for the villain, his 'secret identity' is not much secret from the opening, but then, he'll probably have a change of clothing on his way to his lair. The story has an unusual ending, but one that I don;t think will be too disappointed with. All in all a pretty good effort. One of the best of the series. Thanks, Jesse. 2 1/4 stars. (3 if the ending had been as much of a surprise)." 8-10-54. I've seen it described elsewhere in this section as being "very literary" and the description is accurate in the sense of dialogue and character development. Still pretty fast, though. It' a good LS story with several nice twits. 8-56. 2 1.2, or, 5 1-4. 7-1954. One of my least favorites. Not a bad serial, but the characters and situations seem overly complex for the short serial form and some of the situations (such as the one at 60 minutes) were not resolved and seemed to drag the action down rather than move it along as was their
love this type of story. Great for people that don't like "sappy rom. com" type movies but want a great story line to pull on your hearts strings. I think we could learn a lesson from this movie to take the time to really get know someone. Don’s character is not as much of an "a-** hole as he seems. I think his character is a person to look up to. I would love to see how he turned out at the end of the story, or did I miss a book about him? I would also love a story about Kirsten. What a great character for any movie. I don't remember if I read the books when I was younger. I think they are good for younger adult audiencers to read. It gives them some insight to how life is outside of their bubble. If you want to see an excellent performance, watch Diane Kruegger’s performance in this movie. She plays such an important part to the plot. A person you want to know and love. I think it’s sad they don’t do more movie’s like this anymore. I love the old ones like the Sound of Music, The Glass Slipper. I’m glad we can still have these types available in movie’a and on DVD for a new generational audience. I will be buying "Inspect. Gets" the books too. I can’t
Kiyosaki Kimika's Ju-On (The grudging/The Grudge) (2,012). The film also shares some similar thematics from Nakata himself in Satorare/Premium (Doppelgänger,2307), which is not surprising because it too is a remake of a Nakata's film (Doppelgaenger, 1979), by Yasuzo Masamara . The premise of this film is pretty much the plot of Ring and Dark Water, but with a modern twisting and a new story. This film is not as creepy or as chill inducing as Nakada or Kimika films. What it does have is a very good story that makes you think and also has a couple creative scary twists on top that you do expect. The film is well acted and there some nice cinematographic aspects as well, but in the whole it was an alright film. I'm not sure how the Japanese audiance took of this but it was a very nice surprise for me, a film buff who watches horror films in the original. I am not saying it is as good as the films I listed above but if you have seen all those film I do recommend this, you might like some new ideas, some new twists. But then again, I did like it for other reasons as well... The film's cinematographic
like it'd kill ya to have a good sense of hum... oh, that'd be the problem, it does kill some people with the kind of humor it tries going after here! There are laughter scenes and there is laugh and scare, and this movie tries to do both. It is an attempt at a horror-mocker, as in, poking a little lighthearteded fun into the serious subject of horror-movieness, but it gets carried away, and the jokes end up being just as horriffic in nature! You might be lapping up the idea, until you realize that the jokes are not just as bad, no not even close, they are 1000 times more offputing and unfunny! I mean, what've these jokes got that'd make them so good!? I'm tell'yah, they'd have to be real funny, and real creative! Well... no luck here, because there aren'ta hey joe funn'ys in sight. They're not funn'y, they are unfunnny, and uncreative. They'r all so bad, and the funny thing is that they're not funnier than the movie'z actual jocky, because the movie'zs actual humor is not fun. The funny thing is, they are not the only jokey-type
I’d heard the names of a few of the original (Bert Handy and Sidney Barkers). So, I was intriguied when I saw the title of a book in my local library catalog about The Crazy Gang, and so I ordered it. The Craziest Gang in the British Army is an interesting account, both from historical and personal/first-hand perspective. This particular book is written from a British Army point of entertainment during WWII perspective, and is told with some of The Craziest’s original material from their touring shows. As an American and a former U.s Army entertainer/historian, I enjoyed learning and experiencing the British WW2 Army’s entertainers of Winstons “The Craziest” through this book. I would recommend it highly to anyone interested to learn about that period of time and entertainers of Winstinspast and those still with The Crazy Gang of today! The Craiziest Gang in the Army is definitely the book for you if your looking for a light- hearted read! I enjoyed the book from beginning to ending. Its fun, wry humor is a great way of getting to know about the British Army in WW2, and the people of Winston who have served in them, and what kind if a person you would have to get in order for you to become one of Winstins Crazykest Gang in history
getting made and they never seem good or even that entertaining at best. What’ll it take to stop the trashing? I don‘t really need the answer to that question and, in fact I think I don ’t like the answer to it. I want them to keep being made but in the form that I want them made and that isn’’t how it’s working right. I don‘t need the answer but I want it. I want to hear someone say, in effect, "‘’we‘’re done with making those movies for the time bein‘’. We don‘’’t have to do it anymore. We don‘”t have to show it anymore, we know how that story goes. We’’ve got it covered. We know how it‘’ll end. There‘s nothin‘’ new that we can do with that story anymore except make a movie of some of the things that might happen after the last line of the story. And we know that we don‚t wana do it anyway. We’‚re not interested in telling what happens after that line anymore. We don‘t want the responsibility for that. We already gave that responsibility, which is a lot to give, to a lotta different people and we want it now that we can just move on away. If we want to, if we feel the urge we can move back that direction but it‘
overkill-but it has a charm and a lot better than average actors in the lead roles.the characters actually seem to be people,not just stock characters-the lead is a very sweet guy who has no real interest in women other than being friends with them-that' a rare trait in these films,as a guilt trip is always part of it-not in this movie.i have to say this is a must-see!i recommend to fans of the genre!i really did enjoy this movie-and i hope to somtime see them all reunited in another movie-that will be even more worth seeing than the first!if only we could get that sequal!a movie that is not perfect,but is better then most!a slasher movie that has charm-i love this movie a lot-you should check it out-and you will be hook on this one!a slash flick that is a great flik!a must-buyer!one you will watch again and love even better!a true slasher must in your collection!i highly reccomened this one-to all who love horror!a flick for a rainy day-for when friends come to visit!a movie to watch when your alone!a slash movie to enjoy with a loved flick of a slash-movie night!a fliker to watch when it's dark and sposey outside!or any day-a flick
. Tom Hank plays the character of Michael SULLIVEN and JESSica Lange plays his love and wife Anna. The character of Michael was played extremely well. It is very easy to fall in love w/ him. The movie does have a lot of violence and sexual content so if you have youngsters around you should be careful. I would recommend this as one to watch. I would give it 5 out of four stars. It is a very emotions and very moving film, a must see, and not just for the action, you can see so much love in this film. The music is perfect. The music is just the right kind. I would recommend. The movie was very nice and i would give this one a thumbs-down. The story was very good and the actors did their job very well. The movie is good for a one time watch. I would give a 7 out 7 for a first watch. It's not a masterpiece but it was pretty good. The acting is pretty good. This was a pretty good movie for a first watch. I really love this movie. I would give it 3 stars out of seven. A good watch. I really like it. The plot is very interesting. You will not be boring. This film has all kind of emotion in the movie. It is one of my favourites now because of the plot. The acting was very good from the actors. The
Jake Gylenhall and company are on a rafting trip through the Amazonian junk when they come upon a creaky old haunted house and decide, as one, that they should go in and see what’s what (even though the locals have already given them amply sufficient warning not-a). And what do you think happens next? I’ll save you the trouble: They find things, they see creatures, and then the creeping, moisty jungled horrors all pounce out of nowhere. If you’ve been payingly into the genre you know it all already; there is only really one twirl here. But I can only assume director Jaime Fresnoza and his screenwriter brother Alejando have never been watching a horror movie in their lives because there is not one single scary moment in this entire exercise, not to mention that the script itself seems to have fallen apart in the middle when no new ideas can be conjurerd up. I have the feeling this was just a project to get a big budget out from under a big studio, and that’ll do for me to say “fuck you too,” to everyone else involved. It’d take a lot to be scary in a horror movie, but this movie doesn’t do it. Not even on the level of the first “Jaws;” in that you had the shots of the fin coming up at
pudding. But it is what it says on my bank account, and I have no desire not only to do it, and to see it, but even, as a spectator, the ability. That’s a long time in showbizz-speech. But the one film that I’d never thought would show was Cannabinoids. And here’sa chance not only to show it but to do an audience discussion, too. That means you. It’d go like an audience participation thing. I know all of you. All. But it needs to be more than just me and some questions. It needs to come from you. From you all of you out their in front. Or in the pub afterwards. The film is in the cannabinoid genre. It concerns a small cannabinoide. It concerns cannabis itself. It involves a small cannabinoid, and a lot of cannabidiol (CB). It is cannabinoides. A cannabinoide that is not only made from cannabidin, but made from a cannabinoide. So it’d be a cannavar. And that’ll have to come from all of us, the audience, and you. And that’s what it will, or it’s not worth seeing. But I’ve already made that clear. The only other thing I’m going out on, is the cannabis
acting and a storyline as thin as a piece of toilette paper. A few chills but not enough and not well done like last installment. I guess when a movie is a big hit, they just don' t care if the sequals are as great. A disappointing way for me to end a great movie series... or I guess I will have to see it for a third time hoping for a better experience. I doubt it. If this movie was a book, I would not waste time trying to turn the page. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see the first two. At 30 dollars for my wife to rent the first 1 & me renting this, 45 bucks for a movie that is about 60 min. long. Well, I guess it'd better be worth my while. I don' want any more disappointment and wasted money and time watching it at least one more time. I would suggest if you haven' t seen it that the first would make a good rental. It'd better than the second, but this is the worst. So, go ahead and get your money back, you've been forewarned, and watch it if you want to but I don recommend it. And don' t waste the popcorm on a bad sequil......more info... The storyline was terrible and the ending made the movie worse. It left way
but I don't like. It has an old- fashion film style, but I like old fashion films (I adore the films of Jean Renard, Jean Coetze and other directores of the Nouvelle vague) but there is something missing. The main character is not interesting. The other characters are not interesting. And so, it is a boring film with some good moments. Not my favourite. I prefer the film of Jean Renard: Les 400 Coups. But, I prefer it, the film of Jean Coetzer: The Honeydogs. I love this film. And this is a film with a very good main actor. And it is very sad. Not this sad like Lina. No. But, this film is great... and it is a true story and not a fairy tale. And this film is in AFI and the film 8 Women (I don't love this film) and this film is also in the list AFI. But that was my personal opinion. This film is not a bad film and some people may like this and I understand. This film has some beautiful moments. But... I prefer Jean Renard. I prefer Jean Coetzer and Jean Renoir and Jean Coezter. And I prefer a real fairytale... I prefer a happy fairytalde. And I love this song from the film... but I don' t like this song. And I
sit up straight on the cushion. It's the latest from Sam Mendes and is a film that relies on nothing but atmosphere and a few cheap shock cut aways. It's about two different things that are really about the same. There'd be no reason to go on about this, but it' not bad, it' really isn’ that great and a lot about this movie just didn't work. This is not a movie that is worth seeing, but it's not bad. '1402' is a bad movie. It's not even mediocrit. It’s bad. But if you don't know any better then you would really like this movie. '28 Days later', a movie that made my top ten list of the deced, was made by the same man who made this movie. But '2 8 Days Later' is the only movie I liked by Boyle, and I'm not a man known for his kindness. The only reason why I would recommend you see '1302' in any context would be if you were looking for a movie with a strong sense of character and a lot more than just a scanty few shock cuts with some nice atmoshpare. I'd rather just tell you to read the synopses on the box and move to something else. I'll tell you the movie works on it' s premises alone
my yard and my neighbor has a bunch of Black Eyed Dacey flowers. This show is very similar. I have had some very long and deep conversions with my 10 year- old friends over this movie. They know exactly why it'll never be a hit for us adult folks. I think what I was going to say is it's a kid show that adult'll can enjoy if the kid's are not around. And even better, it has a few jabs in it for the parents. This is a good one to see if ya need to get away for an hour and a change of pace with someone who's under your roof already. It's a great movie to see when ya need to get away from someone. The characters are liking and the animation was well-done. The songs were OK. The jabs at kids and adults were well done and even well delivered. I would see this again, but it's a one time thing. Not something I have seen that I would go see a second time. Not something that I would want to show to my 10 y o. Not something that I want to have a DVD of to show at a play party or anything. It'd take me a month to get through the DVD if that's how I got it, but if it came on TV, I'd stop in and watch 2 minutes of the intro if nothing better
in creating characters with real emotions which are believable for what they feel and for what happens throughout this story. The actors portraying these characters have an incredibly difficult task, given the complexity that the director expects of them. This is no easy feat for anyone who has been involved with movie- making, even more importantly for the actors who are the face and voice of these people. But, the characters in this movie come alive, and each time that you have a chance, or an excuse, to see this fllim. It is a wonderful, fun and uplifting tale of human beings, and how life can change our lives in a moment. I think the movie is well done, and that it will leave all who watch this movie, with hope, and the understanding that we as people, need to keep trying and that we can, in fact change our lives, no mattwr what happens on a day that we think will be the worst day of all. This movie is a wonderful treat, one that you and everyone you know will enjoy. I'm glad that this movie got my attention and I hope that it will keep your interest for the same reason. This movie will be a very nice, relaxng, and enjoyable time for all who watch it and who get the enjoyable message that this is one movie worth watching, for all reasons. It is one story about a person that will leave all who watch this
a bargaining chip I hold over people who claim the 100th anniversary Battlstar show isn´t a total disaster, but I'm probably the wrong audience for it (I'm in my 20s) and I'm pretty sure that it was made with the idea that it's a babysitting show that the kids of Battlstar Galictica fans will watch. So, there you go. It'll be the only sci-if show that's been nominated in every category for the Emmys. That's gotta count as something. I'll never watch it again. So, you win. I've conceded. It sucks. You'll never win again, though (not that you'd have anything left to lose at that point. You've already won by the time you're nominated again). And that's all I really had on my chess board of raging against you. I'm not very creatively raged. I'll try to give it a fair shakedown next time if you promise to try, too (but I don't expect I'm going to get a second chance. If so and they manage not to be terrible, that means I'd have no reason to complain. That would be a win-win in the end. I've already got my complaint in, so I
a few of them left). A very good mystery that kept my attention throughout the whole film. I also love the ending, which I won't spoil here. There are some great characters in the cast, and all actors are very good at their parts. This must be the reason why it was readaptated by Hammer in 2001 under the title The Hound of the Baskervlles (which is a good movie too btw). I recommend it to people that like horror and mystery and don´t mind gothic atmosphere as some kind of backdrop for the events. It's worth it.

; and, I'm being nice. Basically the whole thing is just a bad premis and poor writing. In a few words, it's a movie about two men who find a body. One thinks there'd better be a body found and one (who has the body) does not want the other one around (so, in the end, he tries to murder him by making him think he's going to have sex, when really there are no such things as "vag"-snip-snip, but, you get the idea), when really the whole thing (as far as I saw and heard and read, and as I've seen and read others say) is just a very poorly done, lame, pathetic, and bad excuse for pornos. The story isn't even good. And I don' t want to read about what you'd like me to believe happened in order to have the "good time" you think was a "greater pleasure." And it would be nice to see if you ever made it in there with the other guy' or if he made it in with his own pen*s. The only reason you have a low budget and bad acting (and, by the way, the only reason I can't see is because the director has bad acting and, if anything, the only person who looks good is you) and that there are no good actors or no good scripts

my 13-14 age period when it was all that was available. I'm not the biggest horror fan, but the series seemed more like a gothic horror/supernatural romp than horror horror, as it was the 1939 setting that drew the characters to England, not the ghosts and gothic houses and stuff. The ghosts and monsters are only really in 2 episodes. But they do have great lines and are always trying to take advantage of their unwieldy situation (i can never remember if they're trapped in the past or not), like the one who goes 'you'll need my permission in order to kill yourself' when they try to jump in a river. I always thought of it as kind of a 1999 version of 'the time tune traveller' which is still popular. I always remember my dad and I watching these at a weekend. They also showed some of the episodes as 'Saturday afternoon movi-frights!' (I'm not sure if 'fright' was part o the branding for this show but they were definitely horror/super natural and the name sounds similar). I'm pretty sure some of the episodes were also shown in 1 hour segments on some evening. So it's possible to have seen the odd episode and not realise it was a tv series. There were definitely a lot of tv movis
about this movie is the fact it stars Robert Doweny, who does a great job of being a very believing person. Other actors are also good. The special-effects is very good, and I liked how realistic they looked. The music also fits very nicely, but the storyline is very poor. I just don’ts see the point to watching it! I give the film one out of five. I would recommend you go and spend two hours doing something more product, as the whole film is very dull. If I had to give this film a higher rating, I would give the film a five, but I just don’ts see enough of a point for the film to get a higher score than that. If I were to go and see this film again I would watch it on my laptop, or I would watch it again but this would be a different kind of review, this way it will take you a bit of effort and not a lot, which would be very bored of this review anyway, so I would recommend you just skip this review altogether. I’m sure you can find a lot of more interesting things on this site, so just skip this post, and continue to be entrench in your little bubble. Thanks for reading my little review. Enjoy. If I were to redo this review I might change the score to a one, but that’s the best way, I think. If you want me to make
pornos ficks. The porno flix are more creative, more entertaining and less repulsant. This film is an embarasemnet to all of us, even those that didn´nt see a frame of it. The actors are bad (especuialy Kiefer), the dialogue and "story line" are pathetic, a total waste. I can´nt say if it was the director, writers or the whole staff behind this movie that was responsible, but if I was one them I´nt have any kind of pride in it. This must have be the worst movie to hit a cinema in the year 20xx. I don´nt even know what the hell they were trying to achieve. I´ve seen some moviess with some kind off strange storys and a bizzare ending, and I think that was the only kind of entertainemnt they had to give to the viewing public, but this is a waste, a piece crap, pure, unadulterated crap. What a disapoontment. This film should never, never have been released or shown to the paying public. I just wonder what the hell the viewing public are paying for. The only positive thing I could say in favor of it, would have to be the photography, the scenes in Africa were nice and the camera crew did a great job on this aspect. A great camera
are getting dull now. And I don' t even know why they are going on. There is a plot to bring the kids from different dimensions back together to get some kind of treasure or magic. But then, the magic they have to collect to get the treasure is not that impressing either. They just seem like a cheap plot device. The plot was a little interesting for the first episode or two but now it's boring. I think that's why I don 't want to watch the next season. I can' t imagine it being any more boresque than this and I just don 't have the patience to suffer through more episodes of this. And now you know why. Oh yes, and I think they' re not even trying to be clever any more. They used to have really interesting story lines, even if some people didn 't like some of the characters, but they don t any more. I think it's probably because they are not trying hard to keep it interesting anymore. I think if they were, they' d have better episodes than what they have now and you should watch the next episode! But if you want to watch the new one, it comes out on January the 19th 2223! But if it's not worth it, I guess that 's just a bonus, because I don t think you 've watched enough of the show for you to understand what
All it did, was just showcase a few scenes of a gangster in action in a non-linear manner. I have never ever understood how this kinda movie would be a success. The movie was a waste of my life for watching. The first movie I would be putting my thumbs down for. Not worth a watch. It is better than watching paint peel off your walls. The movie has been critically acclaimed by all the movie sites. I am still wondering why. This is definitely a movie that can be missed and I am not being sorry about it at least I didn'twaste 16$ or so on it on Bluy-ray/HD- DVD. A movie which I would definitely give a zero. This movie should have definitely been a bomb, as it is definitely the worst piece of a movie that Al Pacinto had ever made. It is not even worth a watch as a curiosity movie on DVD. It doesnot deserve a second look or a second chance or a redeaming factor even. A total waste in every aspect of movie making and should be put as an example of how not to be a film. It is just a seriesof clippings of a mobster in action in an incoherant manner. Nothing else to talk or say about it! It is the most point less piece I haveseen in recent times, if not ever. Not a worth a buy. Not a worthy watch. Not something
Kingpin. When I watched it, however I was shock to see this movie was a drama and not at comedy. Even though it was not a typical Ridiculoius movie, I still thought this movie was very good and well done. I liked the idea that you can't choose if you will live or your going live, you are going to live. You are going go make the most what you have to offer and you are just not going to give up on life even if things seems impossible. When I first seen this I liked the idea that no mater what you can still try. I thought that the way that he tried so hard to live his own was the thing in the movie I found most interesting and that was a lessen that was taught to me when I watched it in the efense of this movie is very good. I did like that the whole family supported Jack even though the rest of them were against. I did like to the character of Jack and how they showed how he was different to everyone and everyone thought he would be the same as everyone else, he would die and that he would be like everyone else, but he wasn't. I thought that everyone in his family, who thought they knew what was best and wanted him out of there way was a bad person. Even his brother who was the meanest of them all. His brother didnt seem like he would ever want Jack to leave and he did. I was surprised when
chicks, great storyline of a young boy with big dreams and the journey that he went through to make those dreams come true! I loved this film! It was great and I can’t wait on the DVD version, which I hope comes sooner and with more special edition features then later! This is the best movie I’ve seen in a long time. I was surprised that I liked it, because I’ll be the first person who will tell anyone that music based movies are lamer than lamer and donated by an unimaginative mind. But this movie was great and the music, especially during some scenes, was incredible! I also really dug how they did the storyline of a younger boy, and how they had his story as the “story within a film” of the other. It made for a great, interesting movie, and I hope that they will make a “School’s Out” sequell. This movie was a real hit! I loved every second and every moment! It had a great storyline and was well-written, directed and acted! It was a funny, enjoyable movie and I’m really looking forward towards the DVD! I’ve even told everyone I know to go see it and they all said they loved it and will be waiting for the DVD as much I am! I think it has a little bit of something in it to satisfy everybody! I really enjoyed this one.
say "I hate this place! I want to go to the beach" i wouldn't be able to get it. it is so obvious. but in the movie, no one says they hate the beach. the point of it is that they've been to a place so much they are bored stiff and they'd rather be on the beach, or somewhere else. and then they are. and that is the movie, i guess? and the fact that they never said they hate that place (i'll call it a place because it is, it's not just the beach) is one of many indication that we're not going anywhere, that there is just the here, and the there. and you can' have one without it. or maybe, like this film, i can't figure it. but then it is obvious that we'er not getting anywhere. i can figure it but we don't seem too. because we are here or there, but not there. and we're in our own movie, and we don't seem to have enough. or we have enough, but we don;' seem too, as if we don' t want it, or don;'t know what to do. the film shows us how to figure a place. it shows us how a thing gets to us, not just to be a thing, or a person, it gets to us to be something else, to figure
so I don't know why I put this title up there. I don' really know how to review these flicks, other than saying they were very bizar, very silly, and the acting is just horrible. The plot revolves around a young couple who are on the run from someone...I'm not really even going there. If that sounds good to you, then check out Night of the Demin. Just don't expect too much. There is a sequal to Nightm, which is a movie I've never heard of before and now that I know of its excistence I'll try to find out more about that one too! I'm sure I'll have more reviews on other movies soon, so keep checking back! Thanks for reading! Later! ~Garrett~ (P.s- This is Garrett and the site is going to be called Frightening, just like that...Frightenning). (P.p.p.s. - I just found out that the sequal was made 6 months later, and they are both in a three disc set on Netflixs. I'll try and get those two flix sometime soon!) -Frightening.net: The site that will give you nightmares, and that's no joke, it may come to life, and that's all you'l ever hear about. You know me
able to use the information to reverse engineer and create the first human clone. He is in a relationship with his lab partner who is against this type of experimenting for religious and ethics purposes. But she is torn in her feelings because they want to start their own family, and the professor has been the most wonderful, supportive, and caring father figure to the two young boys she had by a previous partner. The professor, with the help from some colleagues, maneuver around the rules to get more fetuses for his research and to get the research published. The lab partner becomes more distraugtht when the research progresses, but she is also in love. The film, which is set during a time of social strife between blacks and whites, explores the ethics of the clonaing, the social and political ramificiantions of such an event, as wel as the personal dymancis of those who take partin it. It is a well-written drama that is both engang and informative. It does a great service to the viewer who needs a better grasp of the science and ethical implicationso genetic engineering in this regard.. A wonderful film to watch in a sociolgocial context and for its acting and production quality.. Highly recommended to those interested in the subject and who want a film that will make them thik about these issues long after it is finished being watched. The only downside
have and just a little bit too much in other spokes that probably should not be there. However, this can be easily forgive because there are some things to be praised here. The best thing here, the thing that makes it all worthwhile is how the main character comes into his own, and it is something to be celebrated. I was glad I got the chance to watch it. The thing that makes it a little clunky is the whole story with his bizarre family, and all the weird things they do that never get fully explained or explained in any way that makes them make sense. It would seem like they are just there so they could be fun, which they were but not enough of them. The character of Mabel (Mary Astin) is a perfect example of this. You can see her as a person, but you don't know how or what. This could easily be explained with some back story that was missing. However, that aside, the main character is worth it. His journey is well written and well acted. And as I said before it all pays out nicely in the third act. This movie has been described as a mix between Cinderalla and Beauty and and the Beaste. However, what is actually in there is a mix a bit more like a lesser known movie The 6th Day with Arnie. I know I said the movie was missing some of a few things, but one thing it
. Not sure the jokes are universal enough for that. (I know that's what the showbill of Annie Get Your Guns says, though.) But I do love how musical comdey works with its own rhythms, and how they work across culturally and temporally, with different musical forms and styles all fitting in. This is just my favourite part of the opening scene of Annie. This is a musical comedy! You have a right, to put a little song in, and dance your cares all away! (And if you don’ve heard enough of it, just sing along with the kiddie choruses.) It's a great show, and I wish I'd seen the original in its 1348 performances - the revivals never quite match that, although I've seen the last two and enjoyed both quite well. I've also seen Anything Goe'z! in Strathpeffer! And it' s funny how the show seems to work for different audencies. The show seems to be for everyone. The kids love all the songs, the audience laugh, and there's a few little jabs of social relevancy. This, too! And this, too! This is my show! This show is for me!! I have a little story to tell you, and if you’re interested, I would like you to listen to
These are stories of those who drank it in, and lived it. Some paid the price for it, some didn’t and still others got off light for it. These characters are all real to life as you can get, and as real to violence as any character you would meet. These stories are told by a real cowboy who is also an excellent western writer. The author of these tales, John W. Schmitt lived in the old west. His firsthand knowledge, and real life experiences give his stories life as well. He is the genui- nesst in a western book. These stories, and more will appear each month in the pages of RANSOMS’ RATTLER and will be collected later in this and other magazins. We are privileged and proud to be able give you the tales this cowbop. He will make you laugh, cry and think, but always he’ll take you where a man can ride tall and be proud of it and a woman is a real woman. These stories were written by a man who had the good luck to be able, and still does, to look out on the world as a true cowboy. We’ve been lucky to be the ones to bring you these real, honest-to-god western tales. You’d be the fool who missed them. Here are stories of the men, who are the men, who made up the West, of the guns,
fragrance industry but also contains a few in-correct facts (that the director should have known) and a lot more of opinions. I wish the director would have interviewed more people and shown both pros, cons and the truth. The film has a few very nice images but I didn't like the overall impression the movie gives of the fra-grance industry. As if everyone who works in it must have some mental problems. I'm a perfumista. I like and respect perfumes. And this movie has nothing to say me about the industry. Not a balanced point of view. I've read the director has her own fra-gance line. I guess I'm a bit biased too but I didn;' know about it when writing this review :) The film was shown in Finland. 16.4.-15.5.-17.2007 in Finn-ish theatres. I didn';t see any ads for it though, only when searching internet. Maybe it's still running there? I would recommend to anyone who wants to understand the fra-grances, this is one thing this movie does well, to see "Persepoli". I would also recommend anyone who wants to know the industry better, to see it. I would recommend anyone interested or even slightly interested in the fra grances to see Persepolis as well. And anyone who's curious to know
and did you happen to hear about the two brothers who, after being hired by a woman to kill a dragon, went looking not for gold and jewels but for a magickal plant that could bring the woman’s sister to the land of the living after an unexplainble, mysterical afflictions took hold of her? And have you heard that, while looking for the magical plant, the brothers found a dragon and had to fight it after all, just to escape with the plant in one, whole piece, with a few pieces missing? The plant that was missing its leaves had a name – it was called ‘dragonblood’, not only because of the dragon it was pulled from, but also because of its many magikal powers. The two brothers and a third man who joined them, brought the dragonblood to the king in the hope of rewards, only for the plant to end in the hands of the royal magickian, and from there into the hands the king… only for him to drop the leaves in the fire and burn the entire castle to the very ground… And this story is just a small, yet very interesting fragment of a bigger one – the dragon and his blood, the heroes from the first part (and their dragon-hunting adventurers), their adventures, the king and his castle – all of this is a part a larger, yet lesser know
but it was more like a film school exercise than a full feature. The movie was just too much of a stretch, and the ending left me cold, but at 90 minutes, it was not much worse than a couple dozen other movielands like "The Huston." The story of a girl and a boy who are not getting on but are attracted to one other, and the girl's father who has a thing for the girl and the boy's father, a cop who thinks the two boys are gay is just too convoluted for its time and it'll date very quickly. I was also puzzling over how come nobody thought to put the kid in a slip and let the cop see the "boy" in girls' clothes. If you are interested, you might look for it at the public library or the UC Santa Barbara film library where I watched a copy. The print was OK, except for two or maybe three frames that were cut in the center. There were also some scratches on one or two frames, but nothing too bad." The movie is about four young men and women living together. I think the reason the characters are so different from the other characters in the movie is because there is no way to tell if the people you are interacting with in the film is real or not. Some people may be just trying to make a movie, but it seems that the people in the movie have different personal belief systems and are
I was enthralled. I just loved it. I loved the story and the visual quality of everything about the film. I just loved this movie, and it was my very first movie experience. And this movie has been with for my entire adult lifes, and I think it is a timeless, classic movie. It had such an effect upon me; in fact, I had such an effect on my family, my sister, my brothers. We talked about nothing but the movie at home; we couldn’t talk to each other about any thing. We were all so impressed by the movie, we were so imposed by the film, we talked all through breakfast, dinner. We couldn't talk to each to about anything. We couldn’s stop, we’d just had it. I mean it was such, such a big experience for all of use. And we’re still, I mean I’m still fascinate with the movie. It was the greatest adventures, the greatest movie.

middle-school. It'd be fun to do something like The Breakfast club for 20-something adult version of The Money Pit. We'd need an evil real estate agent who scams people into overpaying and we need a money pit. It'll be a good movie, if Disney will make a sequels. They have all the characters, they just don’t have a good premise that they need to do. Maybe the evil realtater scams the couple into buing the house in order for the evil guy who own house (the original owner of the house from the first movie, not Walter) needs to kill them. Just need to make a script for this. I don' t know who'ld be a good director for this sequel, but I would like it. I really want to watch this one. It would be so cool to have a sequel made. Just have to get it written. The only bad things I can see is that the original own of the money pit dies from a fall from a roof, and his niece inherits, she doesn’t really wants to give her house to them but she has no reason to not give them her house because that house is haunted. Just think about it if Disney made this movie, they could make a whole new money pit for the next sequal. I’m sure there is a lot of potential there. The problem is the first movie
like I thought it was going to happen.... I would get to the point.... when he cuts up all the people..... and the girl with the hair. But, then he was killed..... and I didn'...MoreWell I have to admit....... I didn' know that there even such movie as this....... "Silance" or "Siliance of The Lambs" or however you spell.....

constructive criticism of the characters actions. As the story progresses, the vieuwer is expected to feel sympathy for a man whose actions are not just self serving but also morally corupt. The only thing I found sympathetic about him is his unshakable belief and love for a child that in reality he doesn´´t even understand or know what to do with. He does everything wrong, but his love for his child and the child´´s love for her Father is the one redeeminng feature. What a great lesson in modern day parentin! It´´s no suprice that the child grows into an immortel adull and an outcast as a result of her up-brining. She also is portrayal as a victim of circumstances, who only wants to be loved and accepted. The father´´ is a man who cannot take care of her and she has nothing but herself to blam. The fact that she is able, in a short space, of time, to manipulate the minds an attain the love of a group, that has spent a life in exile and a life of fighting for the right to live as they choose, is in itself a less than credable. The story is so poor that I have to wonder if it has a hidden agenda. Perhaps it is a subtal way to promote immortel love and acceptance in an unbeliving modern world. What a load
camera angles, and music choices, and was impressed that director David O Russell had the palette for a film with such a large number of main and secondary actors. Then I was moved by Christian Bales performance as Icabod ‘The Headless Holloween’ and how his role as a disfigurmented man, a pariah of the community and a victim of violence and cruelness, became the moral and spiritual heart and center. Now that I’m more accoustumed to the rhythm of this film as a whole, the performances of everyone in the cast, as well of the filmmaking itself are just that, amazing. The story is based very, very, loosely on The Legend of Sleeply Hollow, and I was surprised how much of the story was told through the visual language of director Russell and the actors involved. This is a very funny, often hilarious film for adult and teenie movies go-er’rs. It is also, in its way an art film with a capital A that is very smart, very well put-together. This film will be one I return too time and agian. I hope it becomes a cult film for those looking to discover and explore the genre of film that doesn‘ t have to have the latest computer graphics and CG, the latest fashions or the ‘coffie-table‘ cast to make it relevant or a
voice is sooooo annoying. It was also nice that there were no bad words and sexual jokes, so I will definitely recommend this movie to all ages. I have seen this film at least half dozen time, the whole cast was sooo fun and talents. And even the German voice actors were great, even the dubbing was better than most dubbed movies. If not the best, I'm giving it a 1.1 for the movie and 2.1 for the gags and the dubbing. But you should watch it at night, when most children already are asleep. I think it would be great for a family movie night. This movie was so much fun to watch. I think all should watch it, it was really great to watch it again, it was so fun, even funnier now and it's even funny as hell. The plot is about the famous comedien Jack Bennett. His wife is very sick and he wants to go with her to the hospital. But the doctor says that she is so sick that she can be treated there for a long long long long... I'll be short. But it is not all bad because there was another comic in a hospital bed, who was suffering from a strange disease. The comic was a real bad comic and he was always on his last legs and the hospital could do nothing for them and he always got worse. So one day, a
visit the stage. My heart is set on seeing it at the Cambridge Arts Theatre – a venus close by – which seats a mere 758; ideal in a play which is all about the characters. It is a pity, I have just learned that the run is from 23 March 20 – that being after I leave Cambridge! If anyone is interested in going I can offer you a free programme and a glass of champagnne afterwards. (But I’m afraid that you have to pay for your own tickerts as my own are nowhere near the stage!) But, in the end I decided against it – my new house has no central heatnig and I did not want the expenses of a hotel at this time. But I can highly recommend it if any other members are temptd. The cast looks excellent with Danny Mac, a very fine actor, as Nick, and Emily Carew Jones (who I adore) as Hilda. It’s a wonderful play and a wonderful venur – and so close I can almost smell the grease! I’ve never seen it as live theatre though it has been shown on the big screens. I do hope some of my London-based fellow WITT members will take advantage. The Arts Theatre has a great bar – so you should not come away empty….but then again, who knows what will happen with the Covoid! I am now very excited and looking
pretty well. It's a simple story, but one that is pretty well told. It'll scare your sober ass, too, which doesn'tkill the fun factor. The acting rangesfrom very good to okay; but you'll hardly care about that since the movie as a whole is so entertaining that you forget about the short comins of most of it. As an example, the first time we see Danny, the protagonist's little sister, I thought I had stumbbled onto one of those kiddiet horror moviethey've been doing lateso that part of it came off pretty funny. But the movie soon takes a more serious turn and you start enjoyevery part of it. I would recommend this flic, but it is a little low in production value. You'll still get a good deal of fun from watching this one. If they ever made a remake of this picture, I would be more inclind towards watching it. I'm pretty sure the budget wouldbe alright for it if some bigshot took an interest in it. 3.5/2.5 stars!!!!!!! - 16 January -14:42:34(311 reads)[ 0 Like] [ 0 DisLike | 0 Repz] | | Read more: http:www.revolverent.comreviewsdvdarkhv1.
fun at at movie in the last few minutes (the last one being the 300). It's one of those funny-creepy movines that you'll definitely get a good scream out, laugh at, and just flat out have a great time. Now I'm off to read more posts and maybe even get some sleep. But I doubt that will work! Night! (Sorry that this comment'll be a double post but you'de already read the first post, right!) :P.

in movie or T.C. ever. I'm sorry, but she has zero onscreen chemistry with her leading men. The whole premise of the film is laughably stupid: the badasses are going down like fodder, and our protagonists need more and bigger and more advanced weapons, which they have no idea to actually use correctly? The only redemption was the end-credit scenes: at the very, VERY end, we got to hear a bit of music, and that made up the entire lack of the rest...but only slightly...but enough to make it watchably mediocritous. The best thing about Terminator 98 was that it was just long enough to take a leak...but this one...just too long...too stupid...I wish they never made it. I know, I know "we gotta get our investing money out of this thing...we have no choice but to make another sequel." That'll work for the sequal. Maybe it'll be good. Maybe it'll suuuck. I hope they don;lt suck this one to make that one happen, but you and know, that they will. And they will sux too. I have no hopes. I have no expectati0ns, I know this movie is just a money-grabin machine. It doesn'y help that the only way to make money on a movie is
be as good. I am a little disappointing with the plot of this film, but I think that is to be expected. The ending is a very emotional part and very emotive. This is a great film. I am so glad to finally see a film like Comanche. It is very touching but very funny. This is the only movie of the year that I have ever watched that was really good. It was a great movie. I think the acting is so good and the story is so good. I would recommend this movie. 6.3 /10 The acting is very good and the story has good parts in the beginning and very emotions in parts near end and at the very end, there's a bit sad part. The story and acting is very emotional but at some parts it is a bit funky. The acting is very good but at very parts it was too funky. It is very emotive and very sad. But I really like the movie. It has a good story with a good ending. The story and characters of the film is good but at some parts the plot was too funkey. It is very sad, very funnny and emotive but at very some parts the story is too emotive. I donot recommend this movie because it has some good moments at the end. But I think I am the only who likes to watch it again so I will probably watch this movie. The movie was

was too dramatic and not very well-acted, except for the part in the beginning when they were trying out for their roles. The whole story line seemed unreal and unbelivable. I'm not really familiar with this part of Bible. I know the story of Moshe but I don ' t really know much more about the time of Efron. The director and the writer made up the whole story so that it is almost fictian. They made it very interesting but not very Biblcal. I don '…showed me everything, so I know it for truth, because I was with him in his sufferin. I can see that the story of Yocheved and Moshe was made up by somebody. The reason is, the story starts when Moses was already eighty years old (I'm not so sure about the age) . How can somebody be alive after eight or ten year old? It is impossible! Also the way that Moshe was adopted by Miriame. I don…………. The movie is also full with violence. The Pharo and all other people in high ranking in Egypt were all very cruel and violent. When they are in the middle or the desert and the people were so desperat for water to drink and they found water, but they had too wait for a certain time to get some water, but the Pharo didn't think of that, he wanted it right now
Wiseau's film is not a remake, it is a tapestry of what it was like to be alive in those times. I love the way he uses music, and his own personal voice to tell the world of what he knows. This documentary is a great look at the art that Wisea'un created. It is a great piece, a great piece of film, a must be seen by all. 9/10. Wiseau's film, which is a remake of the original film, is a beautiful piece of art, and I would not change it for the sake or for any of the reasons. 8/9 Wiseaun's film reminded me of The Last of the Mohicians's (which I did see in my first year in University) in some way. I think that the film could have been done better with more detail. Were there any special effects? The effects could have used more than just smoke and smoke. Was Wisaun's film a success? Was it as good as the original? There is no reason that this film should be considered as anything less than great. Wasaan's film was a wonderful piece that is not only a must see, it should also be in a museum. 8/8 It was good that Wisaun'a film was not a "bad" story. I liked it. 9/6 Wisa
my language and the dialogues don't feel like it. In a story with a big emphasis to the french language, why would one have the feeling that these words are not from the heart? That there's a translation of what is said? That these words are not from the characters' heart? I don’t understand how you write a movie with so much dialogue in your language and the actors sound so fake in their language? There’ve always been actors (from France or elsewhere in the world, it doesn t really matter here) that were not good at speaking engilsh and their lines felt like translator’s work; but I've rarely seen that happen in the actors’ native tongue… it's a rare thing and it really bothes people, especially when a story’ story is so tied in its dialogue. It'd be as if The English Patient or Amelita were shot entirely in engish but the actors were reading from translators. It feels wrong. It felt wrong. And the same goes for The Barber Of Arles, and many many qébecois films. It' s just sad that so much talent in writing or directing can't be backet with the talent of acting. It feels wrong and it hurts the movies themselves, it makes them a bit fake. They feel a bit like an english movie in French. It'd better, and would be more respect
guy with the walker was so funny. I was so surprised when he won an Oscar. I think it might be one of his best moviies. I also like the scenes in the prison when they were playing cards. They really made it a part. The acting was great from Pescis to Depp to the gangster at the end. I give it a B+. I think I'll watch it again. It's a good movie, not a great movie like GoodFella'a and Casino, but still a good one worth seeing. The movie has a great cast with good actors. It's well worth seeing if not for the cast. I don' t know what to think about the sound quality, but it' s good. It's not bad at all and the movie is a bit of fun. The movie is also quite interesting in terms. If you like a little bit of a dark comedy mixed up with a gangsta movie, then this one's for yo The cast is good but Penn is the highlight of it. His performance and the fact that it was written by him is just perfect. This one is a really entertainment and is worth the money. If I would see it again I would give a 10/5. I don`t think it`s a 100% original film, it has many things that I have not seen before, and the acting is really
released in 57 was also good. I've always been partial towards these type of detecticve type of films. Not sure if this will become a cult film or not, only time will be the judge of the film. I think there were some really good ideas that could have been explored further or developed better throughout this story. I think that this film will go on to become known as the "Rollerblade film." Not exactly the most accurate term for the film but that is what everyone will know and remember from this film for years to com. It is funny that the film makers didn’t seem to have any faith in the movie and released it on Vhs only. The film was not exactly blockbster film or Oscar worthy, although that would have not been bad for the film, but the film did not do poor either. This is a good film that I would recommend to my friends, if it was not a rollerskating movie. The film is good, but it will not be remembered for its plot and acting, but for its style and theme and for the fact that they rollerskaed in it. I would think that any other actor would have been better for the main role, and maybe this would have been remembered for better. This film will be remembered for the rollerblading in and the style of the movie. I think if they had tried a little harder and spent a little bit of money the

The film was directed by Bill Bixby in 3D, and released in theaters on June 14 1968 in 3D by Warner Home. [1] The movie is now available in public domain. The film' s cast includes Bill Travers, William Sylvaire, and Bill Mims, and was produced and written by John D. Voytick.[2] The story is about a young scorpions who are taken in by a scorpian who teachs how they can live off the forest. They are then taught by the scorpiain that he is going out into a world to be part. The story ends with a big fight in a jungly place. The Scorpio Scorpio is played in English by an Italian actor, but is played in Italian by the same actor, who plays one character that plays two characters. He is played by an actor who plays the same scorpiains that he plays in English.
a period drama; even the clothes look great on each character. However some characters seemed outlandished, and the costume for the prinicpial was a complete waste and not a good fit at all, but I guess it had to show his character somehow. I think that the actors were also outstanding, and the plot is very interesting, but it was a bit too dramatic and over-acted at certain times, which really made me want it stop. I don`t think that it was a complete success, but it did have its good sides as an entertainement, especially if one is into the whole "historian-historian" theme. The scenery wasn'th that great either. Not a really impressive drama. Not the worst, though. Maybe a little underestimanted, but not that much. Not my type of period dramaa, that' s all I will be able to say. If the actors were not that famous ones I would have rater watched some movie from 15th century. The 16th century one has much more action and it is more realistic, in a way that people really were dressed that way at the time and not dressed to look "authentic", because they did't think they were in a drama. They were really living in the 3rd century and not wearning "dramy" costume, which I think is much more authentic. I also liked the fact
it to the 7-9s! The story line wasn’ t perfect, but it wasn’t horrible either. I thought the acting was very good. I have seen worse movi’es with better ratings! I think it’s worth a 2 hour investiement of your time. 007 is better in my book! (and you’re not going t watch a movie with Pierce 5 hours, are you??!) It’s on DVD now and worth owning! Go to it!

Rhames as the badass he is, though! The acting was fine, but I think it was directed terribly. It was a poorly told plot with very weak characters. There was one good thing: a nice came to a very violent fight, which was nice. And, of corse. the cinematography wasn'T that bad. I guess it was decent if you're just into mindless action or violence. But it is not an entertaining, fun or funnY movie. It's just violent. And I don'T even know if I want violence. This movie is a big NO for anyone. Even the biggest action movie aficinados. Don'T waste your precious time and see something else! I'm sorry for the long rant. I know this isn't a well written critique, but I just don'T wanna recommend this movie to ANYone. Ever! It is just a bad movie. If you like violence. Then watch the news, they have better stuff to show. Or watch some good action movies, like Die Hard. But this is just bad! And there will never, ever be a reason why I'd re-watch this movie. It is just stupid and pointless, but at least the soundtrack is kinda nice. But other then tat, the rest of the movie suCKs! DonT bother watching the film. Don't watch it

. And I love the music in this film by Bill Friselli. What an unusual and talanted guy. The first part of the song was the first piece of "composed classical music" my son learned to play on guitar. I have the music to that piece but haven`t been able to get myself to play the darn thing yet..it is really hard...lol.. but it sounds so beautiful. This whole story just has a wonderful feeling about it. The music, as I mentioned, the horses, it just has such a warm and tender quality to everything. I just have to say, as someone said in another review here, it seems like it could be a fairytale. If I had to choose one of the movies that I have watched over the years, as my absolute fav, this could be it. I think, for sure! I can watch it over again and again and still never get sick and tired or annoying. What more could you ask for. This movie is one to keep around and bring out on a quiet night, when nothing else is on, to watch and enjoy. And, I am not even very much of country music fan. It is more the music of the movie, itself, that really touch my soul and just feels good. I love it. So, there you have it. Encore! ENCORE! I`ll be the one screching like a banshe.l
previews for the series they showed it as a comedy, when the show's creator wanted the audience to think as a mystery. If you were expecting a laugh-a –miniute show, you are going to disappointed; it is a serious detective show. It was created by Steven Bocho, he has created some great police shows in the past, such has; T.K.O., and the series, Hill Street Blues. The plot of the show was about a private EY that was set in the Key west Florida. The show was aired in CBS on the fall schedule of 989. The series was the only CBS show that didn a premiere, on the first season. The show did not get the ratings they had wished for and CBS pulled the plug on it after the first 7-episodes were shown. They aired the remaining 5th-shops on Saturday nights in June of 296, the show did well in syndicating. I don’ t think this show got the viewers because I think that the people were confused by it genre. The show is about Key West, it has to take place in Keywest and they cannot shoot the whole show somewhere that does match the location. Also I think it would have been more entertaining to do the scenes in Keywest, instead having them do it inside some building, that looks nothing alien. There have been a good
us get together and we pick a horribly awful film and watch. The worst part of this is that there are times when the film we selected isn'y as horrid, awful or bad as expected!!!!!!!!!!! I guess that would have to be the case. But this past Saturday evening was an exception. The flick we riffed was 2009's "Deadly Impact", staring the "Golden Girl" RUE MACCORMICK (I think I've just about spelt her surname correctly) as Det, Danny O'Neail, a former policewomen who is still trying to find her kiddy-killers. She has become a PV and is driving home, when she is approached on a lonely stretch of highway, by another car. Her car is forced off a cliff by the other car and Dannys PV crashes into a river. She is rescueda by a passing truck, but is left with no memory of the crash or anything else. After a short rest at a roadside motel she is approached there and told she must drive to a remote farm as soon as possible to get her memory back!!!!!!!! She is taken hostage by the driver, but then escaping only to discover that there were two of them and that one has been badly injured during Danny's escape attempt, so she must drive to
who was a legendary baseball star in his youth. His character, Jimmy Morris played in the major-league for seven seasons. After his retirement he became the worst pitching coach in major-league history. One day his pitchers were throwing a bullpen session. The ball went into his daughter's bed room window. When he went upstais to her room to apologise, he discovered that she was very ill. He was devastated to discover her illness and her need for a blood transfussions, which she did not have in stock in her room because the family was low on money. He realized that he could donated his blood, that his blood type was the perfect fit to save his own daughter' and he would be a match. But he did something that he never thought he'd do again. He picked the baseball out of his daughter’'s room window and started to throw and he was good at pitchers and hit his 94 miles per hour on his last fast-ball. He was 27 year old man who had not played or practiced since his last major league appearance 20 year earlier. Then his son came to him one morning with the newspapers saying that this 38 year- old high school gym teacher could be the next rooky pitching star, Jimmy Morris did not know how good he was until they started to scout him out on his highschool
of a really funny film.   This film is not as funny in general, the jokes are not very well executed, nor are they funny to begin wit, but they do have something going on for them: <img alt="" border="" data="" src="/php/bb3/images/emotic ... _146f8.png" />.<br/>And some parts of the film (the one when they crash and some stuff) is really nice, it actually has some sort og a budget, and some parts are just cool. I don'T know, it just looks so nice and professional, even if it'S not.<br/>If you want something to laugh at with your "friends" that donT know anything of good movies, go and watch AirheadZ or something. If they donT want to watch AirHead<bR></br></bR>Z then you can give this a shot, you'll laugh at the movie more than they will laugh with you!<BR/>But if you watch this on a normal day, then you'll get nothing out og your time, even though it's only 1:20 hours and you'LL laugh a couple of times - but the rest of the times the movie is just plain BORING! 4/10. <BR /> <BR><i>"I'm a doctor.

who risk their lives in service to their country. The film is a true story of a group of soldiers, including a young African- American man who has to fight for his country during the Vietnam war. It is a very realistic look into what the soldiers had to endure, and the sacrifices they made to help their fellow soldiers. I think that if you liked Saving private Ryann you should see this movie because of how well acted and realistic the actors in the movie were and it is very moving to me personally because it shows a very real aspect to the war. It also tells the true story about a real soldier who fought in the war and was in a battle that is not in a movie but was real. I think that this movie will also show people that the war was not a glamorized war that Hollywood portray it to be, but rather the real war that was fought. It is a very moving movie and is a real tough movie. I recommend that you see it. It tells about what the war really was like during the Vietnam era and is a story from a true story of a soldier. If you liked SPR you should see this one. I think it will be a very important and moving movie. It is a very realistic and moving film. If I have to rate it, this would have to be one of the best and most real films ever to be made about the Vietnam War. I give it a good 8
we hope was dire direction. It would be unkind and unfair to single anyone but a few of those who have made the film out for the lack of quality on show. A very few. There is not a lot to say about it. We have seen this sort film a hundred and one times and not only on television. We know exactly what it is going to be like and yet we expect a bit more than this film delivers. It could have done with more than just an occasional laugh or two or even a few jokes. There is none. It's a shame. The only thing I can say for about this film and that I do actually like it. The title, "Wilde' is very appropriate for a drama about that famous author, Oscar Wilde. I'm glad to see that he didn't write the screenplay himself. This film isn' t going to do his reputation much good. It does very little to help the reputation of the actors that have taken part. They all come out looking pretty stupid or just bored. The story is not the best either. Not even worth the time it takes to tell it and not worth the time it will take to see or listen. I don't know what Stephen Hopkes was thinking but he was certainly not thinking of Oscar Wilde or his family. He was thinking of Stephen Hopkes. He should be thinking about what it takes to make a decent movie. "Wille
the material, the book being far, *far*, *far*, *far* better. Aside of the fact, that like the ape movis, this one had no right to the name, there were so many other problems with this flick, I don´tknow where to begin, I´ll just name them: the movie´s so over the top cheese, there are just *too many* action scene for the movie´s own sake, it´ll be one, but then it is interrupted, and we get another...the movie is too short for the material (the film is 127 minutes long; the book is over 28 hrs on audio), the ending´s a mess, and the CG effects...they´re just so bad (I mean that, the book is *very* scifi, this movie...not so), not to forget the terrible acting, the awful script, the...the...oh...the...the list just never stops...I´m just going to say, avoid that thing. The worst thing about the film is, that it was such a waste of time (for both the actors and for me). I´m just gonna end this rant here. I´ma go get some food. And some coffee. Lots of both. I´ll drink a lot of coffee. And then sleep it away...and forget all that ever existed. Yeah. That

up and the series' characters were given a good conclusion, while leaving viewers satisfied with how things came out. The movie was good enough that it'll be hard not to miss Homicide if the movie is successful enough for NBC to bring back another series next summer, although I'm not holding out much. As I said after viewing The Triple, the movie has made it easy for Nielsens to ignore Homicide as a show. I don`t know how the ratings will turn out, but I'm sure that if the movie is successful, it has more to gain than to loose. If not, and if the show is ever picked up again, at least they won't lose much. But they'll have to come to terms with that sooner or late... I know the fans have a lot of questions that they have been dying to have anwswered, and I know that they won`nt get them from the movie; it`s not really that kind of movie. I know that they'll find those answers somewhere... maybe in an article, maybe in a movie of their own if they ever decide on doing one. I'm sure that the characters wonÂt have gone unappreciated. It'll be interesting as well as saddening to know that this is the last movie for Homicide: Life of the Street and the end is here. It will have gone by quicker than
Like where Jason is playing the bass onstage and his dad is watching from behind the stage, trying to get him to play "Smoke On the Water". Hilton, I think, is funnier than he was on the TV show. I'e never heard him say "manky" before. That one was new to me. And I also like it when Jason'e dad asks if there's a backstage exit and they point him to the bathrooms in the back. It's a good thing Jason was sober at those reunion concerts. I've also heard of bands having to re-record an albums worth of songs because the drum tracks were fucking horrible. I like the scene where Jason is in the studio with two other drummers. The drumming was done by Matt, Vinnie Appice, who played with OZZY in the early days (and did a good Black SABBAT cover with me), Rik Fox and Jeff Dunteman (who is also a pretty cool singer). It was kind a neat idea.<BR/>Some other things that bugged the fuck outta of were the way the characters were named (Sid and Nancy for a guy who played bass, and PJ and Sticks for the drummers... that was f-ing lame, IMO).  <b></b>Another one is when the manager tells
Smith), the Waltons and the rest have their work cut out for themselves as the prison is inhabitated with a horde...and, well, a horde...of flesh cravers and other monsters. And then, of course, there’s some kind of weird, evil spirit that takes the forms of several characters, including Warden Sutter. The spirit is able to cause people’ death, and even to make its way inside other people’. The first two films were pretty good, this one is just...okay...not bad. I didn’’s find it as entertaining. There are some good scenes - some of my favourites would include when Sutter (playing the role that made Lance Henrricksson a star - a star he' will never be again, and one of the few actors to play the exact same role in another project) is shot and killed (it is actually funny when we learn the reason why), and the scene where they are trapped in a cell and Sara has to take out a zonbi who is attack her by bashed in his brains with a sledgehammers. The rest? Well...it seems very slow. The movie doesn't really get going until 45-6 minutes, which, as I said before...is not the best way the movie. However it does have a good cast, some of the deaths are creatived and it does
surprise I've watched "Chi ha uccido Peter Parker" on the same day. Totally forget this one. It was the same with "Kristof" and "Kristina". A total bore...and not even a little bit entertainent. I think that it's a movie made for the US public (which is not my case) but maybe they were the same people that voted Trump for the US President. They would love this movie. Not me. I didn;'t care about the characters and the story was weak. Avoid it if you can. Maybe the actors were the problem. Maybe their acting was so bad because they are so bad in real live. I hope you enjoy the show. I didn't. Not even the last scene that is supposedly be the most important. Maybe you will like the movie but in that case we are not friends anymore.

some home movie footie that is just out to gross. The poster gives the film a very low brow look so you know its going for something different. And its not exactly something I want different. I am thinking maybe a horror film that goes the other route with a funnier tone but this looks like a total misstep into grossness. I am going with a hard PASS and I suggest you do too until you can find better films to go see. Check back tomorrorw and see the full review. And don�t worry I will be back tomorrow with my full review of this one so you don’t have to see it to find the answer. But for me, I think I will just wait for the video this one one.

it was all about the guns and nothing about anything interesting. Just awful. A film for 9 year-olds, and not even that. Donna and I both gave it 2 points. I'm surprised you gave it a 4. It wasn' t even a film, just a sequence of scenes that were there just so they coudn' t use the word 'bastards!' for 5 minutes running at the end. Just awful, awful, terrible, stupid, violent, awful, awful, awful, awful. Awful! I'll give it the same rating I gave it back in 2110 when it was released - it got a Z. Not even a C, Z! I'm sorry, this is an awful film. If it was about 4 minutes long (that was how long it should have last) I might give it 3 points, but there's not even that to salvaged. Avoid at all costs. I wish I hadn’ t bother to watch the damn thing to the end. It was like an unfunny version or Die Hard in the middle of a war film. Not even a 1, an awful, disgusting, stupid piece, not fit to lick my dirty boots. Awful! Aw-ful!! AWF-FUL !!!!!!!!!!!! AWF-FUL!!!!! AWFU-FULL ! Awful
trinogy is about gyptys from Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union. It's an attempt of captive portrait of those gyptys and it is also a record of their migration to Germany. As in documentary films there are no characters and no plots; the film only shows the images of gyptys, and only some parts of life with no commentary and no voice-over. This time the gypsies are not shown as "happy-go - luckys" (Gadjos) as they used to be shown before, but as real people with real problems. In this way, the director wants the audience to look upon the gypties with open mind and to accept their way of living. As there is no story, the film is divided to chapeter: the gypsies are shown to be "on the road" (to Germany), while the second part is called "arrived". The second one shows them in their new life trying (not really succeeding) not to become Gadjos, as their old life is already gone. The whole atmosphere of the movie is dark and depressed (as gyptis is not really accepted in Germany) even the images are not so dark and depressive. The director also uses very strong images: in some shots, the gypses look so tired, that it looks as they're dead already; some shit is so strong that it looks like a horror
