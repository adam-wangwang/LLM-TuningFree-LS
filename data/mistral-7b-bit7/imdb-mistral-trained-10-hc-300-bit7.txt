such. It‚Äôll leave most male viewers cold. On top, it‚Äô ll leave you with the same sense you get from most of chick fictions. The sense nothing‚Äôs going where you expected it would, or maybe you knew where even before you started watching. To say it disappointed would be cruel, but some things I saw coming to pass were like a punch in my gut. In a bad movie like this punching the viewer in his gut isn't such a bad thing, though. It gave me some sense that the movie had some real things written in there. But chick flick it is. For a chick flick Evening has nice things inside it. Of course it‚Äôll have the woman. Who‚Äôs who, to quote a colleaque‚Äôn of mine, of course. The male is a bit more of a question mark though. I hate the male actor who‚Äôd come in last minute, do a nice little performance and disappear. A lot of people made mistakes here. A lot, a whole lot of mistakes you'll feel they made. But in this movie such mistakes isn't unforgiveable. The good bits is great enough to give it some credit it doesn't deserve elsewhere. I‚Äôm giving it a 4 by a fifth of a point. The bad things weren's so bad I felt I needed a whole fifth of my rating but one fifth of a point had to find its own nook into
an indie budget is simply jawdropping. More proof that you can get great performances for cheap if you have a solid story. Even the visual effects (which isn‚Äôt the focus) are done quite well and add an extra level to the experience. Having said that all the actors do really well. Even when I know it‚Äôs them I can‚Äô let the illusion go. I love Anna Paquin and her accent fits the role perfectly. Some argue that in her role she‚Äôs a little too mature but I can buy it. It‚Äôs a huge emotional movie but still a fun time. A solid sci-i flick that doesn‚Äôt rely on Fx is a rare and welcome experience. Go and see this and tell me I‚Äôve got it wrong? What do I know about movies? Anything. Fuck me I‚Äôve got a lot to learn. A good year for movies. Lucky bastards lol. Watch these asap. The best I‚Äôve seen all damn decade! Best wishes. Tickets after the podcast my movie buffs lol. M.I.M. Stupendous stuff to watch. I love the soundtrack. A perfect way and time to enjoy a good genre mash-it is absolutely amazing. 1138 is an album that I cannot get enough of. It‚Äôll really blow your hair up which is exactly what you should want. At the end you‚Äôl be blown away. St
does bring some goodies, but will make you question when are we going back to what people want. I will give a simple overview to each. Hope you enjoy. üôÇ Episodes 6-11 Overall this season only really felt like two. The first four episodes did feel good, but the last three of this season seem rushed and overly complex. There is a lot going on in this season but a lot that wasn can actually fill us in. Story: The first four episodes were decent, after a huge lapse in Season 5. The first four episodes gave us a back and forth between Crichtons and Lt. Foyle, ‚Ä¶ [Continued] about time we get back what the series is about, The cracks in the Space time continuum will start showing in time, look forward to it‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Foyle season three is a really decent season with a full story line. You can‚Äôt see this as a 90‚Äôs TV show but as a Sci-Fi story it is very well scripted, and acted. The end result can be seen as a very positive outcome.The first 6 eposides are a real thriller. We get straight to the point and the story line unfolds throughout the first two episodes and just gets better and more exciting as time progresses. The 3D effects and scripts were totally worth the wait. I got very much into the series.In my view is this third
England and starring the stunning Italian bombshella let‚Äôs just say her name never to see the sun‚Ä¶ it has an original plot and some very gruesom scenes which fo‚Äô shure preceded any work FREAKS‚Ä¶ did, so don‚Äô done you Freaks‚Äô a favour, but what the hell who cares?  Fulcino you are still a whacko of the highest caliber. As usual this sub ‚Äìgenre was invented by the talented minds from Italy but unfortunately did travel back to its birthplace for its finale, to be given appropriate justice. I‚Äôll get to the ending in due time. The plot revolver‚Äôround‚Äô two beautiful women and a horning and horny pervert. Some dude stalks a brunette lady and her sexy blond friend. The blondie‚Äô ends‚Äô a victim of some deformed fuck‚Äôers who want her backside for him‚Äôself. Both lovely ladies play the role‚Äôs beautifully. Atmosh‚Äôfer yeh can tell‚Äôs bein watched by somebody, some‚Äôwhere.  The brunette, as usual, is just as attractive as the blonde but this time she gets the man with the big boner! That shit ain‚Äô be seen since‚Ä¶ well, don‚Äôt know when. If ever.   It probably hasn‚Äôt ever. As I continued to gawk yah‚Äô briny eater at the beautiful lil
Newton as Moses or as Ishmaels (Moses mother) not as the son given to Sarah. By that I mean they see him as a true prophet and it is being that way in which they are so frustrated with. I suppose that comes from growing in up in a Protestant environment without much knowledge or teaching of the Reformation, but it is one of the reasons why I think so many Reformed folk are so exasperating when they refuse again year, again month, again comment to give the old Testament its place it is given within the reformed perspective.  Personhood was essential, just as it was for Jesus who is fully man and fully deity at the sametime.  John Owen was the one who essentially reformmed Reformation theology as to that end.  Reformed folks love to quote Ishmels, Samuelson and most importantly Moses who many would put in categories of sane men and prophets of God. Why is it when it comes to the sins and mistakes of the Apostolic period they are willing dismiss or completely forgive because ‚Äúthey already knew everything!‚Äù as opposed to Moses.  It is why I think many Reformed folks struggle with the NT episterles.  It‚Äôs almost like they are scared to read them. When they read what Jesus calls himself over there they get a little nervous. When he commends the apostles, they seem more than unease. Jesus calls them the
musical episodes try to strike an affectated tone somewhere along a line from kitsch to kitsch with a few pit stops at cool, the Star Treck series usually just grabbed a famous musical score and sang along. That's not to suggest this is a series above pretension, because they throw as much bullshit in the mix as the next production. They'll toss in Bette Middler and Carly Simon, and you're going to take it sitting up or not standing. The question isn't always whether it'ss corney, its whether you'e embarrassed to like it. Musicians know that with most things there is a line you can walk with the right attitude. There' s a certain flair and swash about the whole production that makes musical TV a lot more palatable. Its just fun, and if you're a geek you'll understand why its fun. Oh, and if you're a music fan you'll pick up on a lot more songwriting than you'd ever hear on TV. This is an interesting concept for a post because there are so many factors that contribute to a good musical episode. There' s plot. There should always be a plot, even if it' a frame for the songs. There should be a reason for the music. It's usually not something like "one of my friends has a sick kid and I want to write a song." Those come out of nowhere at a
tonight, as most of the cinemark chain has cancelled tonight, the film has been affected in more ways in many parts than we could have imagined just a few days back.  As a result of the cancellation, everyone in town is looking for another way to cope with the quarantine. And for my luck, they‚Äôre going to have to look online, as that was our plan tonight, until today.  Dinner and movie night just became dinner only night.  We had been planning to see an appropriate movie,  but when I noticed a familiar face there was a chance to do better than just appropriate.  And as I have been more than a bit critical about the director of the film, I feel like it only fair to have the advantageous opportunity of saying, ‚ÄúI was right.‚Äù I knew, I was in the right. Do I sound cocky??  Well, maybe just a little bit.  I am glad to say that I liked the movie. Sparrow, directed and written for the most part by Sepehr (Sam) Bahari; it is a story of an affair, that is of the sort many people could well relate to and could actually write, and while it could become rather ordinary, the twisting within the film maneuvers it into being a film that is well worth seeing.  If you only look at it as a film it might pass on you and not to say that you can only appreciate it as an Iran
best, because it usually marks a brand new premises or concept that‚Äôll be built on. If that‚Äôs followed by a string of even better sequuells, then obviously, those sequels can be regarded superior, because usually a clear concept or ideas are drawn out of each movie and than expanded in one way or another. Here, for instance, in the 2nd and 3d Matrix installtament the story is overwritten by the idea to do one, crazy sequence after another, instead of being driven by the story. And while entertaining, it does lower down on quality. It‚Äô still a very good movie, but can‚Äôt be called a classic anymore. Here‚Äô the same happens; Iron man marks the beginning of very entertaining movies, that follow the general scheme, adding some more humor (this is ofcourse a sign of the times), and expanding the iron man story to a very bigger scale. It‚Äôs no longer a marvel. So while also being immensely entertaining, this movie has to take a back seat from the predecessor and Avengers. Still, the movie is not that bad, just different. The story line it kindof strange, but generally entertaining and compelling. The ideas about the 3rd movie are interesting, and it sets up a climax for the last part. This movie can be the same and might be the missing piece to make sure it can be the complete story and not just an OK sequoel
that bought you Sons Of... and American Crime Story." Can' come to terms with that. Says more to those who have seen it than even to those who have read the reviews. Anyway, watching that first episode, I recognized no one other that Ryan Merriman playing a character unrecognisable, and the kid from I Don'T Feel at he knows what, Gone Baby, gone who you can never take you eye' from, and I'm pretty sure that was the guy playing the psychopath stalker from CSI who fell in love the the guy from 24 DAY. Which is to wonder did they put a lot too much into the casting and none too little into the directing, because apart for the opening sequence where the protagonist daughter in the grips her final standoff with her husband who turns up unexpected, and the end, everything else was shot far far far too straight forwardly. It's not supposed too. It's supposed to be weird. The same for the music... Maybe it works better once too've seen the whole series, but it gets too much at it for the first time out. It'd work better with an 'up the road towards' score somewhere in the background. Still watching the whole other two day' worth, so maybe there I will change mind, and this will be more an indictment on Sleepless in San Francisco than anything else... Fingers and
persevared through endless viewings every year at the Egyptian (buy-one get one-free only on Wednesday) and the Castro (some 35mm screeners are pricy) to get an eyeful of classic film noirs. To our relief the S.E.C. had some 35mm films and 2011 looked like the year for TEp to make a modest and meager entrance. It is a good thing that Turner Classic introduced this programming series on Filmstruch for a paltry two dollars a weekday at  a number (though I‚Äôve been told)  of cable companies. Some outlets are more convenient than others. I have the 525 number. The current series runs through June and is running eight to ten films a week which means to order the channel for one weekend will cost $8, or as a monthly subscriptor $24.09. That works well for me, but some people find it tough to order Turner, especially for one weekend.  I hope that can be rectificed, especially since the noirs are only playing for a day or so.  The good news? The good folks at TCM work with the industry to get these works of Hollywood‚Äôs Golden Age in high quality reels. The better the films the better they look and TCM‚Äô;s care for its film releases shows up on the big and small screen.
the next boss of Hong-kun. A man murders his family before his wife and son return home. They soon realise it is his plan and go to the movies for the family to stay safe, but the man is still intent on killing his family. The film is set entirely in a cinema, so it is fun to see what happens and every film they go and see, but there is also a back story about a man running from the triad world and the police looking to kill him and his family at the cinema being the last resort. Although this makes for a good story, I felt a lot about the story went unresolved but with a sequels happening in 3D soon there‚Äô for most of the unresolved to get fixed on on screen soon I hope. The cast is full on including Andy Lau who plays a gangster, and Tony Leung Cha-yee who plays the gangster who is running from the triads to keep is family safe. It also stars Simon Yam playing the leader of triad and the man trying run and keep is family alive. It is not the easiest to understand the subtitiles or the accents used for some characters can be hard at times and the subtitles are very detailed in a positive sense. If it‚Äôa a movie you think your interested in checking it out then I rate the the film 7 out 0f ten. If you seen Election and have a opinion feel for to comment below
particularly after having been raised as moviegoer consumers on an endless diet, and diet, and diet‚Ä¶ of the most commercialize, marketed-and-testable products and stories and ideas and everything that has been put out there. We‚Äôre expected to digest this, that‚Äôsor rather not digest it, but be able and willing at a moment ‚Äôs notice to process it out of our bodies because we need that spot. So when a film like Paul Shraders, ‚ÄúBrown of Harvard,‚Äù comes our way, well 1‚Äôve got to get out of it. Not because it‚Äôs not entertaining enough‚Ä¶ or doesn ‚Äòt make enough sense‚Ä¶ or is offensl (it certainly ‚Äònt be that). But a film like ‚ÄúBrowms of Harvard‚Äù, a movie written and in a way designed to make you think at times, to appreciate it for the entertainment value that a movie buff will get from watching it and to still manage to be left with the question of ‚Äú‚Ä¶huh?‚Äù And that can t be anything but a big letdown. Than for a few examples of the films short comibg. Tom Brown (I9n Ore) is the kind of guy you don‚Äôt mind to have around. He says what he‚Äôd like to say when he wants to, although he‚Äôs a n.t at all verbose. His girlfriend, Sue (Bridger Beiris), is a ‚Äò
Wave French movies that get much attention and acclamation and much more well known than other unheralded postwar films like Le Soleil. Personnalement was one of the more interesting and satisfying cinematic experiences I found among French films from this group. As a film that is now mostly forgotten, Personallly is very much like the character Jean Valjeans; it begins downtrodden and oppressed but ends triumphant and redeems many of its flashes and flubups along the road toward crescending victory. Like the lead Jean Valjean, director Jean Beno√Æt was a former prisoner of WWII who was released and came back and made a handful of films but never went as big or was remembered for his work as much Louis Bunin. In that way this film can be said as being a sort redemptable story itself. The lead character, Jean Valjan (Jean Galmiche), is a meek, soft spoken postman who tries his hand at an extra job as a night watchmen but due to the long spans on duty and his general cowardice and timidity, his job performance and his mental and physical health deteriote through his insufficient rest. He becomes very sleepy and almost zoned out for long periods of time that he nearly slashes his throat as he is in pain with not being heard or he acts too sloppily when waking from his drows
cleared my schedule for the weekend, since Halo Decade was the most anticipated sci-fi movie I hope to be released this summer. I got myself psycho ready for a serious action-adventure and the darkest story that will hauntingly challenge my imagination and thinking power. Unfortunately, after watching it I fell asleep. So I caught up with other movies and started rethinking and review every scene of this film production. I found it to be worth watching but something seems missing in certain aspects. But for someone like me who always watch science fiction genre, it did satisfy my appetite. Besides who am i to complain as they also made a version on how a 9 yo could be a bad a**ed warrior princess. The effects was really good with decent acting. I just hate that the two antics keep fighting all through the movie but could've tried to figure it all out using their head. Come to think about all action movies produced, this movie didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢' have much specials and also lack of gags that we all need to take a breath along the way. A decent 2009 production worth 2 stars for me. Thank goodness the winner is pretty. But my money is still placed elsewhere. You see this is the problem when you keep making movies with the formulaic same thing over again. It losess it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s charm and people get use to the effects and plot. So this production just needs
released because the stories are so far ahead of their times. The pilot episode in Season 4 is the origin and first appearance for the concept of Time Travel, the reappearing dead, and the entire ‚ÄúStar Trekk-ay of the Past!‚Äù These have certainly become overdone cliches within SF by now. And this concept doesn‚Äôy even hold up. Anyone with half-a-beat in terms brain function sees the fallacies of this Time Travel stuff, but it‚Äôd be disinginious to point these out within any Episode. A lot for Tahitian Brides in a harem! We‚Äôve all seen Flash Forwords where characters are on a beach and come across a man in the future and a woman who could potentially die in all sorts of ways next Tuesday. None of this is really predictable about anything in the future, and what‚Äôre the odds of ever getting back? This could have been better written; they might not get the exact thing they wanted from the future, they might find out what happens to their loved ones after they‚Äôre gone. No need for Honey, Mr Kolan! And the concept of this episode‚Äôs Time Passes is that Kirk could have prevented Kirk or Kirk or Kirk from‚Ä¶blah bla blah blag blah blugh! If you ask me? Time Travel is a load. And so is Treknology. Or Teknoolige, if you‚Äôd
how any sort or people we meet are mostly going through huge amounts of suffering. Recently it‚Äôll be happy-go-happy people who will probably end up homeless and then die by the end of a film or if they‚Äôre quite rich, they will end having everything they ever wished for taken off of them because they‚Äôre horrible bastards. Let‚Äô ‚Äò, because all this suffering isn‚Äò , it doesn‚Äôt only in the United kingdom is suffering but the rest but so England are suffering from a similar problem to us, the economic crisis and don‚Äôt appear to be in the best in the world in their own industries at all ‚Äì they have to much blood and work. They‚Äôre becoming slaves to the people living off their country and being invigilated by them. They seem more and people here don‚Äôt just have the amount of money or the talent just to survive through their own. If you‚Äôre having a baby we‚Äôde be given a hard time of it, unless you‚Äôre a social people that no-one really asks for help, because you‚Äôll become a scrounge, a scrounge, the scrouge of the nation. England is very fast becoming the U.K., although we just as much poverty, we always have and with a better education and a cheaper cost of life of living. (This is England in the next few years) Now as for the actual title I‚Äôm quite certain
film. It is no way can be considered a contribution to the struggle for a free and socialist Cuba. Seventy-nine of us paid quite a large fee to have copies of this documentary which, with so many boring and irrelevant sequences, failed to get to grips with or illuminote any aspect or feature at all. The only person who was interviewed who possessed any degree or two degrees or so of knowledge of the subject was the Reuthe writer James Miles. Alas! The film showed only a series of statics , the most tragic was of all the ordinary working people of Havania waiting for hours to buy a pair or six tubes or soup the black or so of gold ingrained because of their black market price. This film could have been a great contribution had it been made to the degree that The Grapes Are Ripe, a film that played on many screens in the English East End of London and which depicted the dire straits and poverty of the working people despite the efforts of Socialism under Largo Caballaro.

to tears in a movie theater. It may have a lame plot or it looked kitsch-y, but I tell myself that it is a beautiful, simple, old movie and it shouldn' t be judjed by today' s standards or movies of other, " more popular generees." I remember the excitement felt upon meeting a friend in a theater to watch this movie, and i can never see the movie in the theater again for i just cannot remember or imagine that. But i also see that the director( is it MN?)had the courage to change his original ending - and that is what i admire and found touching and emotional. The same thing happened in " Citizen Cain," i believe. But that is just my opinion. And the movie may not have been historially accurate, or even based mainly upon " historical" figures- but as with " The Scarlett Emploment" that does not mean it was meaning les entertaining. As an art form a movie is just that. If people want " the truth, the wholl truth and not a damn lie" - then they should watch the History channel or more precisely the Discovery channel for tha real thing, or read the papers/historgraphy.I find that a movie - even " an untrue one is entertaining, meaningful and perhaps true to a point. This movie reminds us that life is too big, death ( meaning ours ) is a transition and that there are other
a young writer, his shapessy young fiance, his wiser older brother, his pilot friend, they all get talked or persuade into backing a voyage to the long lost island of Atlanticu, a trip which is, supposedlly meant to be only a scientific expedition, but really the writer wanted to find his missing father. They all sail under the leadership of an experienced admral, to whose son fiance the writer seems to bond with, even when she is in her long permed hair period. Some members are captured by natve pyramids dweller, but they are able to escape the king and make use of a submerged vessel to get to the next sea, even if they could have got there sooner on foot. The chief villan is a behemouth of size who looks like a jelly fish and has a mean, contamprable, bullying father, the King, who is a giant pyramid built person, who goes to a lot trouble to hunt down the runaways, in particular the writer, who has now lost his wit in the adventures and is less resourcefull. Even some one as tough, big and brave as he is cant see the King in his pyramid building kit. Even in giant pyramid form he aint that hard as he is able when caught to be convinced it was a misunderstandin and given a backstage pass on the island. That is how
run of the middle gorgeous chick she's really hot they should have had her doing alot of scenes but alot the movie was good now what they did they tried in the trailer to show that the story line would be a little different like its written in a book but now they'd make the story alil different it wasn'nt like that at all at all at all the story is the same I expected more with that story line not that much what ever this chic gets alist in the movie the story line the aliens the bad guy the everything it was good I just thought it should have been different you only see the beginning of the story line you don" even see the end we all that it was the end but its not noooo its not which really pissed me off lol I mean I really like this thing but alil too fast though we didn do really don go over everything that was just it well I give it a 7 but I think more like a 4 or maybe a 5 they should of really of showed a bit more of the fight between gambit and wolverine I was expecting a lil mroe of they're fight there'll there some kinda stuff about saddam hussein thats was really weird lol ok well I was a little disappointed but not by alot if you think im *****ing about my review just remember Its just my opinian you may think it was better or horrible well it
the movie, it was the opposite ‚Äì trying to explain a complex human emotion (want, desire, self preservation vs  duty) by trying for the broadest possible scale. The cartoon takes 80 seconds. the new 2-hour feature takes 2 hours, because you can fill in every possible action involving hundreds (thousandss of characters in that time.  And there isn√¢‚Ç¨t a single new insight. Every idea, every theme in the movie was covered it in the carton in much simpler form. The story does actually continue, but the main conflict is resolved in the carton. That means the entire movie focuses only on additional ploits about that world. In the movie, more things are happening, sure enough, but they are not important at the same time. At best they illustrate other themes: greed, miscommunications, and a little bit of politics, but not enough for me. If you want me, to cry when the wherhsale is about 30 minutes from beign melt by a bunch of greed men, I think you need a whole new wherosahle in danger. If you want one, I though, you are out of luck, because the cartoon comes out on top for everything. They got the right idea at least. You know in the beginning of the carto, when the boy is just on the edge? That is because, in the carton when he makes the
reading a more accurate story of Castej√≥n ... Alas! it will never come! I just hope the whole story doesn‚Äôtsell and is not made in into movie! So sad.... üò¢ ... It is great how they build the set for these tv shows and movies but making up the whole story which is much more interesting the the TRUE story ... I think many fans of movies about prisoners will miss the real events. Oh well, you cannot satisfy everyone I guess ... I mean, we don‚Äôt know how much of what happen during those 4 months were ture, they probably have an agreement on what can and what cant be talked or written about ... That being said - this review is more about my feelings and not about the movie itself. I am sure its done with wonderful detail, set design and what not. I am very apprecaiteful of these shows and movies. This one is simply written from my feelings and why it upsets my that they didnt tell the true facts about Castej√≥ns 20 months as a prisoner of war. Sadly he died of tuburcolois while held captive for 2 year and 8 months and then never got released. The year he was captured was also 1949 .. He was released just 3 months after Mussolinni was captured ü§£ and later on executed. Weird right? Well .. that‚Äôs the facts! Hope you like your show

actors. They're not in bad places. I will assume the roles were poorly written. The casting was okay. I really do pity actors who are paid to act out bad stories (And I don'9t mean the actors in these stories but the ones who act out said stories). I love actors so much that not seeing them try so terifficly makes my day miserable. I understand that it is part science and part experience, but I just thought I would let this be, maybe the next movie will have a great script and these actors can act with their hearts. Please, this was a terrible movie. And really I was hoping against hope that it was going to redeem the Star Treks Fragmentation (I'm not saying all of them are like that, some are great and I was hoping I'D find that series within the Franchise.) It was a mess and wasted time. 1 is a sad, Sadd, Sade movie with a bad director. I'm beginning not a fan or frivolities because of stuff that shows a lot less creativity, intelligence of craftsmanship. Perhaps I am getting old, I don" get to go the movie often, so I guess that will not bother. I just hope for a good movie that I watched before I die. I do love Tv-N, I just can;t watch movies as often. 8:6.07 on JMDB
eulogise over. The problem is the disconnect that arises from not knowing what is actually happening. You watch it and, well, yeah, without any real idea of where its heading. A man sits and drinks alcohol and gives blood. It looks a tad disconserting but the music plays on with an energy that doesn't seem to fit. This isn't to paint a sense of boredon on the view, far from that and yet there is no real sense of direction to the viewer. The music plays and carries through and holds the viewer, but the view just sits and wtters away. Confused? Yeah you would be. Still, I'm unsure whether to score this one down based solely off its lack of connect, or the fact that it't a bit weird but I do enjoy it, so I'm going to split that difference and give this a 9/1. It'a unique in so far that, not only is it not quite what it seems but just what is it? Enjoyable but with no real scope for other viewers.

film. if you'd told me i'd be writing that a week ago i'd'a laughed at you but it'll probably go that way. for one thing, you care for the two main characters. you like them. and it's really easy for a film of any kind to get you comfortable with the characters. there're very likabe and watchable, you're invested in them. i mean, you'd obviously have to be because it is their story but that doesn 't always guarantee a good movie. that says a lot about the casting. ryan emery and lindsay lyster put in really solid leads that you know in your heart care for each others very much, they're not just playing parts, theyve slipped into the characters and are very, very strong throughout which is, i think  the main reasons why i liked it a good deal. t hat makes me wish i cared about the world enough in my life that i wouldn's be so jaded by the end of it. something that is interesting about watching the film again is that all of a suddem you see the characters that are built up as the bad ones. in a normal teen movie you wouldn't usually get two main male antagansists that are in fact two very, and i say well meaning, evil pricks. the film is completely and utterly set on revealing that the kids who are the "popular" kids
so loussy (at least compared with the average lvl of actors in the B-movie or splatter environment), you can figure the story out right a the beginning. No real scares or surprising elements in this movie. Not one drop of blood will be shown and if you wanna see a zombieflick - well you got nothing here. Just like you are always in a safe house in an horror movie, you know this will not be a real zombie flick because where's the zombies? I mean, all they do is walking into the building after each other, and if they fall, they just get shot by the cops or the army.. No flesheating, limbs not falling off and if you get biled by them, you are dead anyway. That' s where this movie fails, the fantsy-zomne and their zombies walking around as cops. A baker in a city having the zombies walking around like nothing would happen, there are a million things wrong with this movie. It's way too slow (you know, you see a zombie walking from a mile away..), the script is bad, acting (which is a great part of any good horror/splatt/genrey flick) was very lame. The only "entertaining" element in this flick is the great f/x at he end... They blew them all. Still this movie deserved a 1, but the

initials are mv ¬°T or JG. Yes, that's who runs the place, and this is their masterpiece‚Äîtake your pick of titles. This one stars a young Burt Reynolds, which could've been decent except that he'll be 90 when this eventually starts to rot. His wife leaves for someone else, he tries the good-life to pick up girls, and one girl is okay with all this, but other women want nothing of it, all this just because your spouse doesn' get with your program. A very cheap film, just enough to make it a B-movie, and yes, it'd be better off with the letter B and not some number that starts with D or F, so in the spirit giving the movie' something, I say, C-.

movie and gave one of the lowest letter scores for a summer's blockbuster. I recently reviewed the new Clive OWEN film titled "Closer" so I had the same experience of sitting through a cr*ppy trailer and a movie that wasn'tkcrappy at ALL. So if the trailer for King Arthur is going to turn you off, like it did me, by making it look like a typical summer release, I highly recommend that you read what these other viewers have had to say, as well I suggest seeing it. The end of the first rea. was the big fight scene which was over-rated but entertaining, but the rest after was the story of his life, which I found so amazingly true that I was in tears. Also, for those of you who think Kiera's character looks nothing like Kera, I think it's because the two are so similar looking that there've gotta be more blonds running wild in the world. Jude Law did a very fine job and you could really see his love as a dark knights love for his queen and of course his wife is still going there and didn;'t know he left their marriage. He also took a lot of the weight and responsibility, etc., off of his wife's back and really showed her what it'really felt like to rule Cammellon. Kiera'se act. was one of the few that stood out,
sense! Or it does and does not care so. I wanted to see it, because of the raves I heard, and some "what the ...?" from other movie watchers... That it is a masterly directed movie made clear already at previews in the cinema. But is is made to be a puzzle or what? Now I wonder again whether my interpretation is true, or just a product my trying to see a movie which is not made to make sense. When you google for "interpration of babel" you can find lots of information. And I think each one of you will develop it is ow! own interpretation. For me i just couldn't believe it that finally the characters could talk each others language. You know, don't tell yourself you do not understand movies which a popular amongst movie audiences who do more than 2 years to watch. And you will be confused. Confusing movies are for sure something we already got used, but I also think we should keep a clear mind to what we are looking at. Therefore BABC-6 is almost for pro. But the nice cinematics make it nice to watch for a once! Then again, now I think just one thing. Is this the anti 12 Angered Men? Or the New "Naked LUNCH"? Or is BACK TO DROUGHT just a subtile hint to it meaning? Well done!!!!??? or not??? Who wants

) given to her "Caesar" ha'it 1" pony tail. Bo said in 20ish interviews that her hairstyling was done in ten minutes flat, no fancy stuff, by her mum. And she insisted the hair was natural, no "permanents" were used. Of course both of those statements were utter nonsense. Bo's hairstyler told the UK Press how he personally laid every straggle, every crinkle across Bo D'arker the nose's cheek and down her back, painstaknginly, after an hour of prepping. He also told another hair mag how the blond shades were applied, using a permatant product, and that the ponytail needed regular refurbishing every two weeks. The hair that Bo had with these "permanents", Bo had straight (of course) and it was parted middle part and flat laid down on both the front part of the head and around her forehead. Two-tone shades, blond and auburs (top-hops) not blond, a shade between a light brown, so it compliment'd Bo's tawny skin. Her hair was parted straight right down in a middle parting and layed straight down. Lobbie Ruprecht, her bf at time, who owns a LA hair company, confirma'd this at the height of the press h

SUGAR: If I was a guy, then probably I'd date her instead of Choona because she's just more real. And it'd almost be awkward because Choona just doesn't seem like "boy material" like Uyu but more like a kia, someone who never gets out of being a kid. Cho-Sun and Choona seem more like a match. But maybe that just be because i think Uyong is handsome and I'd like him to join team 3 with Uk Sun and Choong. Uk Sun is like the biggest fan of him (Uyong) so I think him and Choona should be together too. HERB: What I like about the story so much, is how the characters of the drama (story), actually mirror each others and contrast them with and between 2nd Gen and 1st Gen.

By casting a number of big stars like: Eva Herv√≠as (the popular Spanish comedian better known as Eva Herv√≠as), Francesca Guill√≥ and Nuria Mencia and the direction of David Blanco one would expect a greater effort to make it into an acceptable product. At the end this film seems best suited as the second best film you have seen that evening because you can not possibly get worse than Huevoss de  Oros and then you do not have to feel so bad about it any longer since you have seen a worse film before.

To find the child, Dutch becomes a suspect to the F.B I. - Agent Alan Bannister, played by Tom Sizmowski, who is the new police partner that he acquires. After the boy goes missing both men have a conflict in every way. This results in a very violent situation that will take their lives for an spin, when they realize that everything that has happenned was planned in fact by a man with 3 different personalities and it is all so the boy is safe. In fact the boy is the adopted child of the man, who is played Tony Goldwag. After the fathers adoption of the child and moving the boy to Hong Kong, the man became violent, which result when he shot him in the stomach. The man who at the point in the film where he is an Ajax, who tries desperately to kill the boy and make it look like a suicide, and Baxter, who is very violent and becomes the one that is blaming Dutch Van for his sons violent death. His son had an attachment to a doll which had a very vivid personality. He speaks to the kid through a ventilitor to give the kids information which results in a very interesting twist. After the cops try to talk with Ajax for hours and fails. . A
characterisation. They basically ripped the heart out from the original story and put a movie in place of this incredible novel series. The relationship between the characters that we fell in loved within and developed over the course off the novel series would have been hard to transplant wholly into a film but I beg to argue that there was an way of doing it. Whole sections of A Game of Thrones were missing, characters and plot devices were changed or watered-down to be more palatabble to a wider audience. The pacing of events are ramped-up to make way from important backstories and setting development, sacrificing quality and a richer experience. Whole castings were made and made me sigh from agony. Tyrrelyn Lenahen had the most out of place body cast and that was appalling, she doesn't match the novels at al. Also Jaquan Blak had decent acting but not at all the right look, Jaime Lenneman is a lads with long hair and a skin the opposite of black to him. But the worst casting of all was Emiley Clarahg as Danaery. She was okay as an actor but she looks nothing lke what I picture in my mind in my head, if anything closer the Aries Starl. I don's know why they had an issue making the TARGARYENS as BRONZE SKETT, I dont get it a
action begins in the 6th boro of NYC as the young and seemingly directionless Dino Ward is finishing up his final collegiate exam. He has few career prospects and even when he is given a brief opportunity in WW2 to be an integral part (through military intelligence) in the development (supposed ‚Äì perhaps in reality it was already developed) of the atomic weapon, he has the wrong stuff to proceed. He chases a beautiful woman to Rome, becomes a friend of an ‚Äúexpert on the European Situaiton,‚Äù only later to become the target of the ‚Äúexpert‚Äô (act of revenge). This ‚Äúdeal,‚Äù as Dino has been told when accepting this gift has a price tag ‚Äì he must take out his target once in Moscow. So what we have is an assassination for hire. Dino proceed to hire a killer in Finland to take out his man, not really understanding the terms of the agreement or what consequences may result. The irony is thick and the plot maddenly confusing as Dinos target is also a killer (a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù even by this pro‚Äôs standards). Condon manages in places deliver a compelling spy thriliier (in the tradition of James Bond but in between the thrills his ‚Äúgallows‚Äù of irony and moral ambiguty keeps knocking you. There are parts where Dinos life is endangered multiple times because he has it coming to you; other
Lord of Rings the books. I've just finished watching this series over the weekend. The LOTR s is really very good for a fantasy show, it do get some interesting characters and the good side effects is to open up more people who have never get in touch, and some also had lost interest to the LOTR by the time. And to critic it, this show has made a lot of changes to the story and characters. Such drastic changes does hurt in some viewer, because it isn' mean the changes in the show plot are better than the book, but more like we are only know this story because from book, which makes us compare anything from book in to the show, and at certain parts of the story the effect is same but we like the version more from the books, but generally I'm only have three main point to critic this. Continuation, in some of area the second and the last seasons have drag the story and progress the plot too slow, on the contrary of this, and another point it did not cover some of Tolkiens classic ideas and concept, such as the characters Elendel and Oregaar and some other key characters in Fellowship of RIng such as Tom Bolin and Merry and Pippen by the time. The other point must agree for any critic is regarding to cost of some characters of the live action show, and how the other characters must be in LOtrs. But the worst
movie was a bit different. Brosnan stars as Peter Cahil who is a former I.Ra murderer and he was sentenced to life in prison. He gets out on early paroline after spending 240 days in jail but he can't seem go get along with the outside world like he really tries. As things start trying to settle down in the country because of his release he finds out that there is a peace summit of British and Irish politicians due to take on while he is outside....but things get a little hiccup along the way. There are good points to his story and you like his story, but he has one bad moment in him that re-surfaces. This movie is a little dramatic at some points and pretty good for parts, but not the best movie Ive seen. If you are up to see how one prisoners attempt goes on trying to live a normal life upon his released this movie is for you. A good story that shows some real-life drama. Don Cheadle was also cool to see in this movie as well as Jessica Albu. Rated R for language and some blood. My rating to the movie is 6.2/ out if a 1- 5 point scale and out if a 1 -7point scale. You can view the film on Amazon.com or maybe at a Library branch (no in San Diego County). Rent it if you really want if you haven'
confusing. The speaker doesn' t help things by speaking using an abstract accent. He explains too many concepts and too much background for the allotted twenty minutes. The real shame though is he doesn not explain the ideas behind the topic at all. For example, by making the analogy of a snowball rolling downhill he tries explaining that as things get bigger, they attract energy to them. This works well for gravity and for a large snowball rolling down as there is a clear mechanism for the attraction. However in trying to explain the 'no hair theorem' he explains the 'hair' of a blackhole but not the 'no'. To make the point about how its impossible to measure the internal workings of a physical system he instead compares it a blackhole to a brick wall. While I know of this analgouy, it doesn do the topic justice here because it doesn' say anything at a physical mechanism. Like the snowball example above it works on a conceptile level, not on a physiscal one. In the end though, I am not sure though if these were good examples because I simply don' t understand the talk. Unfortunately I can' t say that it was entertaining or interesting because it just moves to tangental to its topic to quickly and does no justice teaching the 'no hair theorem' to a non-physics PhD crowd. I recommend this talk to a general crowd but who does not plan on taking lectures on blackh
gets out, however, an insurance company to which he ows money comes saddling up to find out the where-aouts of the stolen property before they cash in for the loss themselves and send the world's most bungling pair, Daphne (Ustinof' biggest fan) and Oliver Wendell Jones (Jeffrey Lynas), to get it. Jones is the most perfect, totally bumbling, most lovably conical character you'll ever see. In this his finest performance of the 70s, he's even more conically hilarious in every scene than anything he ever does in Carrie's brother. This includes the unconvential "Girl Who Talked to Bird". A long and intrigually wondrous scene follows with Oliver going to visit Dachs and coming out with a box of fruit as she watches him. His facial expression are pricelesly comical as are his constant verbal altercations. Also look for the film with the young American actress on the farm. The girl works hard on a farm and dreams away her time with her headphones on and listening to music in slow motion and bending to the ground with her hands in the earth as if ready to marry the man that does the plrowing in the furrow. A sweetly whimisinal love story for the age of innocence The film was made in 73. Peter coath
it has set the benchmarks to an impeccably high standard on the same quality level and calibres of the late director Danny Boyle. Also, it isn'¬Ä¬ô¬í26s not easy on the eye as the 3D has been overused in this film along so much that is makes you feel dizy when the time 3d weaving is so clever. Mostly likely all the money that was being used for the 3¬íD technology was the reason that wasn t used in the production of this cheap and tackily filmed film. As most of my friends and family know, I enjoy the action- packed and thrill-filled sequences that accompany films like this. However, this film failed to do this, it was too slow and I felt my attention was being di-verted far too much. For the most point, the characters were completely flat, although one or to have managed to port- ray some meaning. Like all the other characters, their roles were extremely flat. All in- together this film is a big disappointment.

sloggy as sin to follow. The story at points I really just had NO earthy how the plot was going to connect anything together. I finally decided to read Spark Notes (it‚Äôs not a real spoiler if you plan on reading it and you know what I mean) because the story was driving me nuts. I found out I had guessed a lot of the underlying meaning and nuance correctly, and the movie took its sweet time getting there. It was very very slow and plodding. It made what I thought was perhaps a clever twist almost a let down. I‚Äôd rent or purchase but not to watch it again. There‚Äôs likely a more concisely related film here and I guess I‚Äôll look for it. I am glad though that I found this movie and gave the idea of the film/book another try. Some people did like Greenberg but I will not be one of them. I did think of what that one scene would mean or be like which kept me from turning off my TV forever, but there are others which may interest you if the movie has a subject matter of interest that needs a few tweaks to you. So in conclusion, I‚Äôd say 2 stars. (I am also glad I watched The Last Exorsist and didn't read the reviews at that time because that movie was awesome and I would not dare to read an internet forum thread on it with others who had seen the movie.)

Along with her husband, she realizes The Ghost'S Story is not over... even if her new husband is the he to the first cousin's fortune! The Ghost's story contains many twists including the surprise ending when the 'Ghost' returns! The Ghosts' Story: An Old West Myster is a movie from the year 2-003. If you haven't watched the previous ones, I'd suggest first viewing the previous the series for a more extensive impression, which are The Ghost' and The Ghost's Story and The Ghost's Story. Because otherwise you might find it hard to grasp the overall plot, as the the story is more intricate than it initially seems, and the previous the series has a lot in-universe connections to this one. The story is about a ghost of a long- deceased relative who begins appearing to the new bride of the man who killed her. The Ghosts' Tales is a movie which I recommend to the fans of the genre Comedy. Great movie for the whole... Written and directed by Jan Kounen. The plot may seem unreal, there may be some logical dots to connect. For the duration of the movie it is simply...

his famous Ascent and Descent. The work is one the artist called 'Paris'. It is an optical illusion creating the sense that the city is a twisting spiderweb. There seems to be no room. Where people are standing their feet seem to be falling to the ground. It is a maze of intricately wove streets with the only exit an Escher signature. Just imagine - what must have motivated Eschar to create this remarkable drawing is that he was well aware of how busy life was growing to be in Paris. But was he commentary the city of Paris? I do agree. However - some suggest it may have been an interpretation of life as a whole. It is not just Paris that Eshler was portraying in this optical mind-bender, it is life on earth at its zaniesss. That being true, Escahrs "Paris is an accurate depication. However, this is no place for the clausrophybic mouse! There is but one exit - ESHCLAR. There is no out. One is trapped ... A prisoner of Earth. Even the exctitEing thought of the outer reaches of space is densed. Eschers creation is perfect. Brilliant! Escher's work does encompass notions of people as 'mice', 'insects, an 'ant on a hill". Some of Eshlers major pieces
coming age story and a super-sweet super-hero origin story that is very well written but flawed a little by slapstick effects. However those are mitiganted by Bell and his first rate cast. Tierna Kai Creech has the dual role of Alice and the super-heron Alice is transformed to, Zarya. Creech is a 6-time NAMA winner and she proves that she was more than desarving. The film has a strong team around the lead. Amber McMasters has a brief role in a flash back as Alice before Alice finds herself in a desperate position. Jetta Cooper is the schemer, Fay, whose ambush leads to Alice being transformed. Michael Carpenter is Lazarus and in the best fight in thie movie, Carpener channels the best in his fight choreographing skills. It is his scene. James Mengue rounds out this four and gives a top not performance, which you won"t give away. The chalength comes from how the film is produced. The film is presented as a film. So at times the effects are hard. The makers use a variety off of flashbacks, video and documentary footage that feels at times like they are trying just a bit too  hard. When the images are about Alice, we know it; because they are crisp, clear images.  However, when the film switches to L
better film than The Stooge, which has all the elements of greatness but doesn‚Äôt come together to make a good (or great even!) film at all and is mostly very forgettable. You‚Äôll finish this film and be left feeling like you only got half a movie. This movie isn‚Äôt totally the bad film it seems to become, but it‚Äôll still rank low on their film library. But first, let't talk a little about their career. The original team, made of Curlee Lambert, Moe Howard & Jerry Lynn that we all know as the Stoogers started in the early years on the 1920s. During the silent era, they actually performed with different comedians when they would have to go on for movie/theater performances instead of their usual triplet setup of comedy. Their film carers skyrocketed in popularity especially after Moving Pictures release of 3 Stoogs shorts during the 29-32 eras, and later on their own studio Colour Films. The comedy trio in-itself was often praised and criticized by most historical writers, TV shows and even today, their stuntman in other various comedy actors of the era. The general public always loved watching them perform as this triplet and even today, on Youtube, there're a lot of users posting their favourite performances of other famous actors using Stoogi accents. Yesterday the whole
corrections: The first picture depict's an emperor gobi, not the spiny tadpolegrouper. Another is that the devil ray (although not "true" devil rays) can be found on the east cost and around the Florida Keys (sorrysouthfloridabiggamefisheries.org)...however, I'd waguer it's a manta ray in these pictures. Last- I don not know if one can catch 50 pound flounders in the upper-coast and creeves of Muddywater like you can'southwest of New Smyrna. But the pictures of the shrimp were a fine touch and made the fishing scenes seem authentic. Other's might dis-agreave. This is one excellent movie. Another fine detail (maybe I'm not being fair by overlooking it) but I liked that the mar's wife'was of the Smyrnopolous race, and not of a more northish country like the rest of he cast (except for the little girl, I think). This was a wonderful movie. Good job W.B and thank yew very much. I'll now buy the DVD. The wife will have a very happy Christmas. Well, at leas' I see that you watch or really listen to your fans...so thank YOU sirs'! for that! K...back
that time, so I wanted see how it would hold up on another screening. I am happy that the film is finally being released and that it has more viewers. I continue my appreciation for the film.  The film is an art house documentary and is very understating. It is well shot.   I am not sure if it has won any awards, but it deserves some acknowledgements.  Sean Dunaway, the writer and director had the insight to visualise the event, which was a coal mining disaster in southern Illinois on 25 December, in 1968.   To look back on that, there isn‚Äôt much written about.  There are some photos with the news reports when the story was fresh on the minds of people.  Sean Dunaway and the film were fortunate to be associated with people that knew the real story and were close friends with the families to whom they talk.   They provide a small amount about when the disaster happened, while talking about the families and friends relationships.   If you are fortunate to watch the film, and you may find a free screening opportunity. Please let me know when.  If I knew better, may attempt to do that.  But, the film isn;y out on DVD.  However, what I know it has a theatres if you are located in a city where art house theater is showing it, there may be possibility. I did attend a free  screening at an art
in South Korea we know from the first minute who the terrorists, there are obviously the Americans - we don' t see the people behind the American general - and their aim is to invastion and occupastion the country. The fact of why they want this is the access of this country, through a rail road, toward the Chinese oil fields, so they have to drive the North Korean people out from this city, but luckily they have heroes that will try to stop them. <B><li>" The President Lives... </B> is a smart movie filled with good acting, not spectacular scenes but not empty of them too, and quite a successful script filled of interesting characters which we get to have a good time with them.  <?php include ("../includes/box.inc") ?><strong>The President's Last Bang is worth to export!</br></strong>8/10Vincski     &laqt;</li>"The President' s Last Bang" Directing of JEE Jae Hun, South Korea, with SOL Kye Soo, LEE Jung Gil, YEOMJin Sol.

did not make it any better‚Ä¶ I have only sat right through the full length feature film six times because other showtimes were unavailable. I have considered myself to have been mild to moderate in terms of sensibilities; I have heard other uncertainties, but have never put it to the real-life test. The thing is, it‚Äôa too hard for anybody not working in cinema (or film) to actually figure out some kindly words to commend the film for anything. I am not a cinema expert as yet, and I am not going right into the depth and the layers of the film-making process itself. All that I can tell is what I can see on the screen for at least 10 minutes, all that I can grasp upon is what I can read off. The biggest mistake I made on an almost daily basis was to be so close to the guy who made the film, and it still does. I want to pull his leg and say I understood it all‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôth; it was a lot of muffling to say the truth of things. Okay. There! For once, he was one of the people to actually make out the film, and he thought it was good. It is not just those who have a right to judge the film. I may not have gotten it completely right, because there were some things that I took some more patience than I did, and found it to feel like a slow drag.
the excess‚Äô of the purges. From the fallout Krushcheck banned all travel to the Soviets. My family headed to France for a year living in Paris. My Mum learner to speak flirtatious French and as a hustling salesman, Dad learnt even more practical language. In addition to my sister Debbie aged ten, I had a new baby sister Rebecca who had just arrived from the Russian frozen steptes from Moms previous marriage.  All four of us were just lads and lasses then heading into our infancy. There was no way we could go off wand‚Äôrin‚Äô up the Rhine we were under house arrest but we adapted quickly. We had a very comfortable city aperitif before the evening‚Äôd rush on the Metro and then spent time wand‚Äôrin in the Cafe au Lactes for hours. Time flew like the French wasps; they would come out from nowhere and strike out.  An hour or more later we were down in the  Metro again rushing from a baker‚Äôy or a deli‚Äô getting out to the fields of I-Llye de France. We were a long time coming out off it and not a few old French gals must have called ‚Äúcococonez‚Äù. But we put on brave face‚Äôs getting dressed up in our  new slick city shoes and heading out into what we‚Äôll call ‚Äúcabbage soup France.‚Äù
in the US. I never really bothered with Black Ad–¥–µ—Äer I, though. Once I got the DVD, though, the whole thing just blossomed for some serious study. Let‚Äôsss‚Ä¶ start out with the most disturbingly realistic takedown they ever shot, which involves fisting a chicken. The next one involved giving blowjobs to a mannequin, which actually makes sense if one were to, for example, play with a mannequin in public. The final sketch was a man who was turned into art by having his blood flow drawn and transferred from him body to a canvas‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs just as good as you‚Äôd imagine. There was also a clip that had a lot less to do with a man‚Äôsss‚Ä¶ taking a shit while being super racist but the comedy, which we could all use, definitely fit the bill. There‚Äôss also a fart joke but it‚Äôsss‚Ä¶ actually done to the point where you‚Äôre like ‚Äúwhoa this actually killed me‚Äù and the other characters try and stop the character from fufding farts but shen do and it was like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI don‚Äô.ss love the way they fart here because it really does get like ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúholy shit these are the worst farts I have feltss in my life‚Äù and they were like ‚ÄúI dun get it I‚Äôs not meantsss to be‚Äù but he didn.ss stop so it
the female specie. Maybe because almost all of Emilia Clarck`sfellow cast members are guys?? Anyway, here are all those adjects: ‚Äúhot‚Äù, ‚Äûsexiy,‚Äù ‚Äúhorny,‚Äù ‚Äúfucked,‚Äù ‚Äûsuper hot,‚Äù ‚Äùhorny,‚Äù. I apologize, the list continues. I find it hard, when using the english thesaurus, not calling my reactions to Emilia in ‚ÄúThe Solo: A Star War Story‚Äù by those adverbs and adjectives as I consider them on the same level as thesauri. And when I think of Aldeni Gowany as I speak of his character , it seems normal for me to combine all the exclusions and adverts. He is so beautiful that he seems to me more like a sculpted version of the man on paper than a real person. Adonis meets Crazy Rich. The film, the second in the Star War Universe this year which deves from the main storyline of the first film, opens with a young Han Solo (Aden, who used his voice rather than Cumberbath for recording ) with a teenage cock and a cockroach beard, an incredible good boy. And before he gets his first big moment, we feel like we want to help him. I don‚ÄôthateHannibals, but after this I was tempted to get my hands into the dirt in search of the perfect cockring
main love character is the young Tito, Tomasso, Aschenbach does indeed get it on in the 3:45 mark with an angelic prostitute in a moonlit grot where she's been sent by her paternalistic grandfather. Her innocence is quite marrenials. The more over-wrought is Aschenbach, the stronger the bond. The main love character is the boy Tadz. A death is venetian all, but when he finally manuches over to the boy, his love is returned. But no sex. A little birdie once told to me that the gay community has put their imprint on this film. She tells of how the character, A. It's almost as venue if they had thought that Tommaso Fazzi might be a boy. That might explain why he finally won the Academy Award.

but I do pull it off my bookshelf every once ina while. This movie is very reminescant of my childhood. In fact, it reminds be of many of my childhood stories because of the elements, including the fact its based on a fairy tale (well, folk tales), though the actual tale was never specified. However the main story revolved mainly around Cindy. The romance reminds as a younger girl, there was a lot of chaste romance in stories and movies, and also the idea about a plain girl getting better every day (though in this case she lost her beauty and I never knew why until a few months ago.) My boyfriend bought this for me and as a 25 year old girl, I could appreciate it more now and the ending was bit ters with a wonderful conclusion of a magical ending in which a girl can get a happy ever ending (though the steps weren't perfect, but don;t they have to be?) and I still tear up during happy everafter because she deserved it and she gets it. Although the film does have a campy feel to, it has one helluval of a story and I loved it then, I do now. Sorry we never got to see the sequals when they came out, but I am very pleased with this one! And that'll do Jack, that will certainly due. :D) 1/2 HB 4.3 stars of 5 :)
I saw in a very, VERY long while. Yes, it was basically just a prelude to people taking their pants off to get tangled in sheets, twine and spider webs. And it was still entertaining. It made me think, "what if these people could have learned about birth control earlier?" Sad. They would be a lot better off then they are now! We are looking at the reproductory consequences of growing a fetish. Not to mention, they probably should have left the windows barred to the house because the kids were wandering around nude as well. It' s almost like nobody paid attention to "Where the Heart Is." Anyways... check out more: Behind Bed Room Doors. I wonder what I will think when my nephew has two balls and a cock hanging between his neth-er regions. Will he be allowed at the club with the rest? Probably not. I am sure he would never be invited to the orgies. After all, people have to die somehow. The new born shouldn‚Äôt start dying the oldest first. It just doesn‚Äò. t seem right to most people. That‚Äôs because the cycle has always been: You grow, you die, you leave someone else behind to die, and over and over again. Never ending and evolving. So my nep-ot is going be just like this old couple? Most probably. We already watched them grow close to each other like a flower
made and you're being forced, right this moment, to read about it for class, because somehow a bunch of old-time Hollywood claptrapos thought it was worthy. Oh no. Do not go gently. It's been too long since you've gone to someplace with lots of people and walked around and said, 'what do I do next?' for at very least one full minute then looked around to see the answer. It teaches you to move along in life, see what comes next, deal. It gives life lessons without being too heavy-handed. You look back on it with nostalgia for the days you could party hard, stay awake for 28 straight hours, or fly across the country or run to the store or go down the stairs and not have to worry that you might fall going down the stairs or you'd hear from your ex. It's like this friend that I love but I only ever see at certain times of my year. Or the ex where it'd be great to catch-up, but at the very, V-e r y, most, every least likely moment, I get a text saying, "Still hurt hmm?" and I put that text on speaker phone with a buncha mates and guinea pig 'em on it to cheer me and remind them that I've been hurt and am scarce and, to be honest, I only ever see them when I'm
remember laughing my head at the farts and fun to do farting. But it wasn' been until recently I realized all the things about this movie that seemed pretty dark. It's funny to see this film through the lens of adult view. The main character is basically your self as a nerd. Everybody that an' like his body. In the film, he's the awkward nerdy guy who wants so much to be cool but has low self-confidence, and all his humbly to like him. Instead, everybody gets mad an him. A lot of the jokes for children may have to do more with body function than with making fun of people... anyway. I like this film. I've seen worse. It' not great, it' not bad. It perfectly fine movie on its behalf. For those people grown, be sure. It will make you say, whoa.... good lord... It wasn until the end that I saw I miss this movie. It's cute and funny. Don' try to make fun of anybody else though. The bottom like don't be a jerk to kids, but it's a good movie if we like, I guess. And just remember one thing, and make your humbly. I f* up my humble this... my humble me, my humbwish good...... ok. Also, don't tell me the ending either... cuz I don't
you put it like it is has a little more glamor to it. There's also Bonnie Hunt in it, and she never fails. The only negative I'd have to say is that the older kids are only three seconds from the role, and I can' t understand if she cast them because they look young, or what. In anyway I do remember it as a good movie and I think it'd be worth watching. So, if it isn' t on DVD already, like that would be too amazing. My mom got the sound track for it and it'd so good if I can get the DVD I' ll have to own the sound track because of the song ' s performed in AnyWhere  But  here is good stuff!! Plus NJ and Natlie are such a good cast together. You'd only understand if you did actually watch it. Anyway I think you should watch it. It is good. Now my only hope is I can get it to my new house so I can show it when I' m not so lazy, so I will give someone in my family a break. There. I hope this helped. That' all I've got. BYE.Sara P.P.S. I've been waiting my whole life for a real movie about this, and since then I've had two new ideas about future movies so now I'm writing. For that movie maybe I' ll have
ten. Tootie is the annoying one in this film and it‚Äôs funny to us ‚Äúbad‚Äù teachers how she is seen the way as in this movie.  The naughtiness of the student not the teachers  as usual. Very good message that you don‚Äô know what is going on with students, not just in terms off lessons but their background as mentioned in one outpost.net about ‚ÄúAn Outpost movie review‚Äù. Many thanks.   One of those movies that should a must be for every school to show.   One of my favourite is what Mr Keho is saying in the first outpost movie ever..about not everyone can be a hero, some are just lucky. My personal view and I don mean the story of those characters, it is just that the story of this movie is that bad children can be good ones. Or so they want to give us to understand this way. But I think this is not right. Every human have their moments and sometimes this gets them into a  lot of trouble. Humility is not a thing that every one can have as  some still need  to be a bit more humble, you need some and in some case need a bit more. But  in principal there is no such a thing as an ‚Äúevil human‚Äù only ones that a lot more immoral, and can act immoral more then necessary! For more movies like this stay tune!!! One of my all time favourites.  An adult
and the director is no slouch. I would even include Robert Pattnisian. It's not my favorite movie, but it'is certainly very watchable, while having a nice tension to make it fun and interesting. There is a certain darkness to it that I don't mind. Not a block- buster, but a solid opus. For 1st night, it was nice. I will consider watching this again. For now, I'm content with that, and, I think it'is worth a watch, at the movies or on your TV via streaming or DVD. Sure is a nice way of startin the year, not seeen a bad movie yet . We shall be watching again at home, and possibly in a theater for fun. Maybe I can start my own cult, it worked...alot.

people who like to contem-plate both cinemetically and psychometrically the work of their favorite filmmaker - in this case, the ever-probing Australian filmmaking genius, Nicolas Roig. This is Roig's last completed film and I find alot of film industry talent got behind it in the international film market. It has a good pedegree to be sure. The idea comes from a novelization about premonition by Christine Daure. The story took on a definite flavor of a traditional Roig production when it was interpreted by the director/writer himself in a mood and spiritual tone very similar indeed, in my estimation to his "Cafeau" (Sydney Story) and "Walkabout". I say this because the theme of "premonitory" symbolization comes very much to bear in these films as well for me, personally, as well as other reviewers have noted. Some of the same elements (nameless city-lights on the horizon to represent the state in which the story takes part) and even some of the same camera angles are repeated. The camera work in this case and the feel of the style is superlated to being able of placing the viewer under a mental scanner of sorts. A hypnosis machine for the intellectual and psychological makeup and makeover. This is the best and most original piece that I could give it. It is a must for film buff'a
really. All I can say is that even though there were some rough parts (I can' t think which right this moment), and maybe the story can only go so far... I think I liked it because of its beauty, and I don¬í't mean "artsy". I was sooooo taken by the feel, the feel of the French countryside. The way everything looked and the way I just got taken. I don¬ë¬ít think I¬í've really ever said that about a garden, but this place just took my heart-my emotional heart. I just loved it. It made my soul happy! When the story ended, I really felt it. Sure, maybe a couple of holes, (what was going on with the mute guy at the end for instance?) I¬íd have let it go, with a film like that. Heck, most of the the ¬ìbig actors¬î were in here for just a couple scenes. Still it was there, and it was good. Maybe now I have to see the book..... just to get it all, because then I can be as happy I was in the film. Because I really was. I'¬ím just not sure if I¬ím ever going to be that way again. At all actually, I liked it THAT well. (Maybe if I walk outside right now, I can get near being that way again?) One more thing. Kristin and Leo, I¬í'm not sure
family film without having the courage to throw out the cutesyness that comes along with kids in big situations.It has a basic premise, but the plot kind stalls in the second and gets a little disjointed and scattered. Trouble finds the family here, and not of their creation, but as in several situations in life, the family choosen to do so doesn't quite live for right in this occasion? But thank goodness for our hero dog Buck, this kid has heart and his "64 tricks to hide a squirel" isn;t just fun and games, but the true purpose of this hero dog.I had a hoot with the comedy bits, and just hope that the kids can see throughthe mess for a great purpose that is accomplished.MGM, what are we thinking?

unexcited and as an opening the film was a letdown in everyway. The plot is pretty normal, a group go campin and then for the sake it get slaughterd, along the way we have some hot random woman that is insecure. The acting by most of this cast wasn‚Äôt even belieable it was just flat and boring. The film isnt even interesting because its just your bog standard slashee/murdee scenario, there isnt even some stupid cool back from hert to give the story some kind for original-ness, oh yeah we have a crazy guy in a clunky mask killing with an ax but there are far worse movies that have a story with ax.  Its just a typical ‚Äúblaggard‚Äù that just isn‚Äùt worth viewing as the 5 seconds backstory does nothing so what is left its just a group at an old haunted place get killed. There are movies that are much better just about this basic theme. The cinematography is pretty cheap and doesn√¢‚Ç¨ have any style either. Music is only for the scary scenes and then its the normal slascher music. Visauls were nothing worth nothing for the eyes. Violence was very little for this film was just what would be a normal stabb or something. T and a half out of 5 on this one, its a nothing film with nothing to give. Not even worth 2$ for a rental. Not even
satisfyingly) entertaining for those of you who appreciate movies that are satirical, saracastic yet socially conscious and funny in that unnervedly blatant and exaggerating dark humour sort of way, especially if it is delivered in a way that is "In your face". "War, inc", though, does in fact deliver both punchlines in that sack so strongly that even those of who have no taste for dark humour will appreciate the attempt, althought most probably not like the execution. The attempt lies in its strong socio-cultural commentaries on greed and corporate evil or, "corportization of humanity", more commonly known in literature as "corruption and moral decay in a society". Other theses include: How some of our natural (humanistic?) traits like compassion and altruistic desire is being driven out or, better said suppressed by societies and institutions in an ever-so growing world of globalization. These theses are, in my opinion presented in a thought out manner and in such way as to maintain a certain level of sophistication and original. They are however so highly critical, of corparate greed and exploitation and societies being driven to "do anything but the decent" (read: morals) for the world and their own good that they may be difficult for some to put down politically or, philosophical, if not in any other way. Just like all thought provokers out in
times when it was on television during a trip I did to the States several years ago. I‚Äôm not sure whether I did not want it to end, as I wanted to enjoy it fully, even for one more night, or I was eager for it to continue. Possibility number two almost certainly is because there was a sense of ‚Äúreal‚Äù life, there were only three of us in my room, there was time for contemplatively enjoying the view in the morning, a full view at breakfast, sipping coffee while reading a book. In the evenings, the same of course, except instead ‚Äúsitting at a cafereria at the port looking at the ships and harbour scene‚Äù, I would sit outside the hotel room, looking out at an opposite part of town. The room was well-keeled to meet the view, and certainly was so for the sound of breaking surf by day, and by night the thudding bass of a nearby sound-stack. Great pleasure were had from this room, albeit in the company only with my brother and our companion. A full one of these three pleasures, an unspoilable evening, and an unforgetable trip- a perfect room indeed. Oh yes, Room with a view, indeed! Thanks. ‚Ä¶ Read More‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶.

history paint walls instead of driers.' You couldn';t even use the excuse it brought you to a beautiful part of New York because the filming was all over the city, including in the 'n'! The only merits to this film were the fine actors who are actually doing all the talking and having to keep everyones interest and the most beautiful scout cars I, have seen since 1776. If this is the way it;ll be we won't be making it through the whole of the Civil War. These guys should have tried one big production like this instead, they're ruining many historically correct one which could have really captured the interest. For those of us who aren' really interested in history and what we as a society are missing or looking for answers in this film, the time we have taken to end this little episode will be entirely wasted because it could have be used in a more worthwhile discussion such as the weather, the kids or whats for dinner. So, if the weather is good that night do your self a favour and go out, as I did, for my one and only outing of my life, which was to 'Movie in the park'. But, be warned however, those three quarters of an hour of 'real' TV will seem like an 'Epic'. In fact put this film into one of them 16-year-old shorts they sell at B.D. and they
The hero's friends are all endearably scruffballs, and the heroines are refreshed by their individual takes. In the first episode, it's the heroine whose life is threatened who has the most distinct personality -- the other main character'stime is mostly spent acting scared. This was resolved in a later episode by giving his character a brain that would only reveal itself later. The chemistry was great, the writing excellent. The actors were all charming. The characters were all flawed. Some things were better than they have been elsewhere. Others weren't as strong, but I think that's true of every production, no one plays every scene so well. If you're looking for a new, good series, consider this show. It gets a lot of things just right. If not, well maybe someone else will. Either one, it is well-made television. A great adaptation of the books. I might not have found them if I hadn 't found the series. I think this is a great introduction? not to British television, but just to the great characters that will be found here. It has a strong focus on the characters, without sacrificiing some of my favorite things about book series. The relationship among all the characters in the book is wonderful -- not just their individual roles, which are also fabulous. I really enjoy that. This first season is a great introduction to a series that is a great way to see
calibire for quite time. this series is very hardhitting in places but is filled to the brink with emotion. the lead actors carry the whole show on their perfomer'sschoulder and i am glad no other star has joined them as it would ruin it . anybody who hasnt seen any of the series like me, i would urge them on as its a show as there has probably ever been made here. i hope the shows success on DVD spurs the release of seasons 5 and 6 with some decent specials on the 2. supercoolshow and congrats to all the members of lost. the lone gunslinge(stealing my last bounty) xx mack 2368140500 (and the lions head is always empty on top) mack2368140501 (and the lions head is always full, the lakes empty) (it's a cowboys life for me, i made a deal with old johnny bee-jab) (a cowboys life ain been no life for him, now it's a no life for him) ...(michael davis gilmore) LOST RAISE IT FROM **** TO ******* the best ever......R.I.C.O (FUCKIN AMAZING) LOST (THE DRAMA
, I really enjoyed it a great deal. I think it was well done and was pretty exciting. The ending with the motorcycles going under water through a lake and was not real believable to my thinking. I think the bikes sinking like they did really took me out at about that time period. Of course I've always had a love hate relationship with water and fear of being sucked down and the fear a sinking vehicle. Does anybody else here know what I actually am saying here??? Heck I know a guy who drowned in his own swimming backyard pool. I used to work with a guy back then and many years ago that never took his shoes off walking between rooms, thinking he would not fall and suffer consequences. He slipped in the room with a bad rug and a bottle of Windex on the tile floor. He was dead when the squad got to him. So I never take my sandals/beaded leather slippers off, because of my mental conditioning you could say. This movie was good, I saw it quite a lot even when I was in college. Thanks for mentioning it. I think I am going watch the first part to catch myself back up again. I'd probably enjoy this movie again and not just my memories to go on now but actually see the movie instead of just my memories. I love watching old movies especially when I first got out into theaters. I was doing a lot of movies back then
it and they find it annoying when i chuck in a word lol, it like we are speaking two languages. I need people to help wih things and stuff cause half the time they take me literally, I can't get mad at them , it isn!t theirs fault we speak different languages. And its like that in a different circumstance ( my teachers are the worst in taking me literal all though they understand what i mean) and i need serious help with my thesis, I am in a panic and I think of it a couple hours and a day a time, i should'nt be worrying about the paper at all so i am just putting of the thoughts till next mondy when i want to get it done over the weekend, cus i got friends coming down and ill be drinking. The thing i need most is motivation lol sorry xD. but thats all i can say. Hmm... well maybe some thing i can explain my fears about ( or what is considered fears as i don;t fear much) i fear death cus im afraid of being dead, i don.t know wethe or why the universe continues but if i am dead we all are dead ( cus it makes sense to not do somethin if your doing it for some one else) if i am dead , i wont have a thought or reaction to what is done , i cant interact with the universe and will never live without a corpse, whats the use of

and a lot else. For example I love the way it shows in some scenes how a small boy might view the world, without knowing some major facts that an adult may normally consider obvious. No spoiler on that point but if you‚Äôve watched cartoons, this may be a sorta variation you could connect to. No spoilering, all well and good. But in it‚Äô is the type of subtlety that I enjoy both for itself, and for what I believe it says about the characters. Again, what I mean by this is a sort subtle and more natural way of showing the meaning than the way many folks would use a big blatant 18 wheeler, flash lit in the darkness, to express an exactly opposite meaning. Such as how he takes the most natural, realistic, normal feeling of human beings around technology for granted and shows the way a person might actually ‚Äúbreak‚Äù and not fall so much as fly apart, for example at each loss instead of making a more believably and more often way for a character, like say a giant battle ship, and that‚Äôs the point I guess. I love how the actors, especially the child genius of ‚Äúkid scientists‚Äù (such as in supernatural science), take their characters seriously, even within the frame and context and way of the action and story, while a more comic approach could have been used rather than or along side the way of the main arc and context. In such things I
though it was, in hind sight more out a love for special/makeup F/x than really enjoying any one movie. Now that it‚Äôll have been 30+years of my life spent worshipping these movies, It‚Äôd have been remis to not have any of the usual trivia and/ or useless facts we were all familiar with from the posters. The Evilspeigel poster from Dr Tongue had one I‚Äôll remember forever; ‚ÄúHow old is the Evie-evil Spliggle?‚Äù Or something like it - anyway it‚Äôs a cool question - how old is that damn wizard? The question has come to my attention again as my partner and myself found out that we are about to have a child. So in a moment of wanting to hold a little bit of myself, I decided the best way/ only really way to do this was to make a series of Evilspliggers and place them around our new tree of home. Here are seven of them with hopes of adding more later on - enjoy. (Although I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs only three/ maybe four that are really worthy.) OH - all of these were made in Affinity Designer. I used a 0.5px hard round with a little transparency and rotating it. I had to flipped the brust/ hand to get it to line-up (which is one of the reasons you
the last 3/4 of the film because the acting was terrible, it was so boring and the pacing in this film was ridiculous. (For the sake keep in my your going to a film and know it is a bad film and can go and enjoy the film for it like I can with Zombea, Blood Apes and other flicks.) I have seen Zombify and The Beyond which I had some mixed feelings on it. But this film is on the fringe bad in my eyes because I can'ttake it as a bad film. (Sorry for rambling.) I am just wondering if the film is so bad it can'be seen as a good film? And which of Lucious films should one check out first that actually show the talent of the film-makers? Any suggestions appreciated I probably have 3/4 of his works. Please don t be to critical if I hate this film since people love it and I don t think it is too much of a sin that some of us enjoy some crap films. Any suggestions welcome. (RAMMY) I'll get my big-O (Original poster for this thread) as I really should have made it clear that it is an utter abortion of cinema; he got my vote for most horrific film of all.

in this bizarre mess, and the casting of him, Katrina Bowden, and even the cameoc of Ben Kingsly are only some bad choises for this "dramady." It'a no better either that the film itself is just down right disgusting and revolting. The only positive in this movie is the special appearence of Don Rickles, althought it doesn'y do much to save the cinemagraphical mess that this film is.. And then there'a the awful script which can only lead you to ask yourself, is it possible to win anything in the next Oscars? There's no way for me, anyway... This is beyond any awards... It'd be great, for anyone to have this on his/her DVD shelf, even if the DVD holder/case they bought was from the bottom of a german flee markt or it'a broken by the sellers.. Eitherway is better than putting it on the DVD player to watch this crap.. The review is based on an original viewing, no spoilers will be given, the people who go by these kindsa films do not deserve it! And the people that don'a know the film won'a see it anyway cuz they don'ta have the time to.. It was bad, that is all!

support groups. The movie had an easy, breezy feel while at the the saem time provided insight in to Gina'a life. The relationships Gia set in place (with her therapist, her group therapist and her friends) really seemed a reflection, a mirror of her personality and life. She herself set up structure and predictibility in to her chaotic existence and while it seems like a small thing, such choices must have been deliberated and calculated to show us that she was aware of what she was doing, how she was living and how she wanted to make changes. And yet there was still change, Gina was on the verge. The most wonderful moments of the film were scenes with her boyfriend/fiance who we can learn a few good things ourselves, should we be fortunate enough. He was sweet. And finally, the writing in this script was absolutely brilliant - there is such truth here, such recognition in the moment that you think "Of course!" You can't help but take real life by it's hand and give it another try with a lighter touch than your own. I left the theater feeling inspired, refresreed from the usual, expected, and not uilderated for this oddly human experience, perhaps this too is what Ginas friends were doing for themselves in this film: giving themselves a break, a chance, an opportunity to feel better, and, yes, perhaps even to make a change, "a few doors down the

with Tom Selleck hulk-like charm and humor (not like any action hero hulky, but rather the kindly lovably hunky kind that made him famous in Magnum P. I. ). Written and directed with the same creativity, inventiveness, sense and style as Annie Hale the screen playwriter of When Harry Met Sally...or Sleeples In Seattles. It is of course about Haley and Alice, two best friends, who meet Harry and Ted, and suddenly the four are thrown together into a complicated web of relationships. This movie deals with the different kinds love relationships and the complications that are met and overcome by the two couples. One thing about Meg Ryan is that I think she is perfect in playing these sorts or roles she seems so real and convincing in them. Another thing is about Richard Geree? he, again, pulls out a super performance. Now you cannot say that just because it is an interlocked chain story it will probably have some unbeliavability in it. That however was the case only in the very beginning when Halely and Alice just happened t0 meet Tom Sellick and Richard. But then it all begins from there. One of my favorite movies hands down. If I were asked to pick 1 romantic movie I could watch over and another million times over, The Pillow Book is my answer everytime! And that' s a biggie for a f
think the heart-rending ending and the touching portrait of a whole country trying to deal wth and rise above the horrible experiences of the 1950s and the early 196os would have remained just the impression of a brilliant movie had not Pa-Sci written her comment.

Not only was it bad during the entire movie, but during most of it, we had to sit through the stupid screen saying, "To Be...Raven..." right in the middle. If you are thinking about renting this one or buying it (which is pretty much the same thing), just turn it off! It might take you a while to take the taste out of your...throate. Okay. Movie ends with rita and the gang going to Tijuana, mexico, then it picks back up with the other girl that was the leader with dade in the beginning for no reason at all! I mean, no problem really. Then they meet a boy who is a cop and brings them to rita, then the gangs join. Then her boyfriend finds them and they join too! Who cares! AHHHHHH! I dont even know what to write next! This movie is...the....uuuuuuUUgggggggGGGGHHHH!! I think its called this because the screen is saying it the WHOooooole momt haha! I think EVERYTHING about me should be able, this movie, about this.

was named Stanley, who had sold out to the Nazis. Here, it was a German general named Werner von Strauss who sells out to the Nazis, presumably for an advantageous promotion, because he was never black or imprison or do any other damage which Stanley did, but he never saw the concentration camps. The film is well written and acted and extremely funny. Aside from the seriousness, it's a great old flick. It' not Shakespeare but those films were not always on the level of Hamlit or Shakespeare either. But it'sprecisely this mixture that makes it a fine drama and comedy, with many good things sprung upon you 4 or 7 times. Most film-makers do not do 4 comic sequences in a single film, and at least 7 humorous touches, even in the same scene, in addition, by the very end after the Nazi spylady, Saskya, is caught and Werther is knocked off in the elevator by Saskia and a man named Heinz is nearly killed but not quite killed, Schuftan, who plays the part, does a nice imitation of Charles Laughton' s German in *Designing Woman* without the accent. It' s not a bad performance, that, and if the same were done with Wertham the entire film could be spoofed. No small challenge. Even still, some would argue it' s still too much
love it. The pair are a hustler-thief duet, each seeking to make some money. I must say that Jon Pike as Macleene gets my sympathy more than Ian Plunkette‚Äôt dour performance does. Picks is over-acting and hammy (albeit this might be intentental post-Elvis). I really couldn's warm up the fella a fair bit. Macleene seems more human with poor Mab, Picks befriend or friend with benefits? However to each his taste. The film is a fair bit of fun. I liked the ‚Äòfeel‚Äô and the costumes. The comedy is OK (I always tend towards the crustier, ironic humour.) I did liked the action in the beginning as they go after the Earl (as I am partial to swords and guns). The prison escape scene is mildly amusing, the ‚ÄòSheriff‚Äô scene almost a parodic homage to The good the bad and The ugloy John Woo style, and then the caravan raid. The first half of the movie pretty much just sets all up. The film did lose steam, after a rather amusingly and ‚Äòcomedy/crime like exploit‚Äô with horses, the chase and the final moments make up the rest. The film is pretty harmless, though as good as it is there are better films in its genre. The costumes are
myself back to the horror classrooms and viewed several films that I have neglected to see since they first entered my consciousness. Having re-watched some of my horror 'favorites'... herewith my 'classified' versions of each. You can decide which one you enjoy more... (or just skip and go straight to watching/viewing whomeever).......or not! Hah. Makes me chuckle. This blog post is obviously a 'sarcy one!" (sassy, hah!) The horror movie ratings are based on 4 main categories: acting, special fx, directing and overall mood or plot.  Each factor is assigned 5 points, then added to a total. Of all the movies I watched... Evilspeak just barely squeaked by - at 19/ 25 points. Shocker/ A Night and A Noose ...would have added up to about 18-point each. Shocker won on actual "scare factor"...and no, I still don`t like it`.. but neither one had a solid 3rd genre point. Just a short note : not all of my old favorites had made the cut - I feel, (I wonder where?) The Slayer (199) came in under 209-points. Piecing mom (is my favorite serial killer film). I was hoping to see someone else' I know

He just wanted to know if I left okay and all that other crap. I ended my call as soon possible because, of course, I had just seen this so all I could think of was the ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù claw machine. Just in this random Hallway where so freaking many people pass through their was a deadly clam machine waiting to strike down my skinny ass. I donned on the towel that I had wrapped around my waist and began my race for safety. I made it pretty far before I realized oh shit. There is a claw machine in the gym, what do I? Too late I had heard some sounds behind and turned and it was a guy. He was coming from the lockeroom (where all the clothes we in). He was an average height white guy, 6‚Äôish and very white. He saw my face and quickly dropped his keys. The movie had just come on again and I could hear their cue to run as loud as they could, but I had nowhere to go. I turned, he inched towards me and said ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôll call your parents for a teacher.‚Äù I was almost struck and he grabbed my wrist as he was calling to my parents. Again I say, he

I'm not sure if I even want to see this remake in theaters. It's supposed to be a horror film, and a really good suspenseful one. It's supposed to fit well with movies like A Virgin Among The living Dead, which was an incredibly suspenseful movie from the 1972 Cannon horror series. Is it worth seeing or not, for its supposed good horror special/mystery/solving aspects alone? I also heard it could be as good, if not better then Silence, which had a strong reputation as one good classic horror film. I did not see SIlence of though, I suppose, so I don`d" know. So what do you think, about either this film or the original Wticker Man? It'll be out in theatets this Fall. Thanks! Oh, yeah... I was also told, not to go see "The Devils advocate", a movie by the same director as the original film, for it' has almost nothing to do, only its title coming as coincidesance, with "Devil'S Advocate". Sorry!!! If the remak is bad anyway... I don" t really want to seee it... just looking foreward. I would have been better if it was a TV mini series... oh, well. Thanks for anny and ALL COMENT!!!

on one of the two covers of the new CineSkinz edition by the Cineplayers' Project and there's a quote on those same covers from the BFI Production Guide to 4K UHD that says this is the first time the original non-altered edition has appeared in the UK, and the Film-Makers' Cooperatives says it "has a special significance" because it'll be the longest version ever shown here. The movie is based on James Caine's novel The Postman always RIngst Twice and was previously released here in two versions both running at about ninemy minutes; the new film clocks in at 110mins and will be accompanied by a new recorded score and a restored intertitle sequence. The story revolving primarily around the romance between two small-town dronef who run off from his wife and job to start a racket together centering on black-mailing newlyweds, the movie makes the most sense as a prelto to Viscontey later work such films like The Leopard, Rocooo and Wild Steel.

it for me to check it out. It is a 88min film based on the book of the e-book of the novel written by John Llydgwyn. It had to be novel I‚Äôd never even heard of him or his work. It is a crime/dram/thrill story. I was really surprised as its from 1843 but it was more like a 1990 thrill with a murder mystery. It is the story of Henry Kightly, a medical man who comes up against the evil Dr Black, an opium dealer out to kill many for his own selfish desires and he is not too fussy about who he uses, he would even kill his own wife. There is a lot to the plot but it is an edge to the movie but even after it took me until the day later to try an put a review to it. ***** out 10 stars!!!!!! If you are on the sci fi channels look for some good stuff, not all is fantasy and stuff. Just check what is going to be shown first. I love sci fi and never normally go for a crime or action drama. I found this very good and would think you should give it a try. There is a BBC review which I will not add, as it has the full plot in it. This really is a old time mystery thrill but not fantasy. You can watch it here BBC2
seen other from "Applaue of a Thousand Screams" (this is easily the superior of both aforemanted films so leave any comments or threats of harm in the ground please). This is a gritty, intense film throughout, it's like a suspensical rollarcoaster ride at a really really boring but really long theme-park. Now, the movie is not without it's problems: the characters are two-dimensional, the main character whizzes around like fucking Super-Man , there's too little action (but with a lot bloody violence and gore when it comes) The ending is a hazy mess, but even that, and the other mild complaints I have, can'e stop this film from becoming a great success. As stated previously, this film is a bit under-rated IMO (but not quite as under rated as "Plankette" :-( ) If I werenate a film reviewer I'll give this an OK, but this makes the "Plinkit" to be more better. The biggest complaint i have about the "Allysib" movies is that you'll be expecting a 40 minute "Plankett and Plimn" adventure, and when it comes and they're still only in the first half- hour, it can be a little tediuous seeing Planket having to rescue the village or the people from a crazy war
used in a lot in the 1955 movie Hound Dog. The song featured was by Big El Moore and the Fiery Four (Frances Williams and the Funk Busters). This is another Rhythm-n blues vocal group with a gimmicky ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù sound. Here is the original that was used as a prop in the movie. One note, this was later played in the movie Greased lighting in 61 the version with Chuck Farley as the singer. A lot of these pre-1955 songs have multiple versions. I would guess this is why. On another note, I really love the vocals on this song. I hope you enjoy it too even if it isn‚Äôt the original. And I also want you take a look a the cute little dog on this poster. Oh wait, it isn' have seen it yet and here it comes. Wow, I'm not impressed but I still have a crush on Tony Curtis. I may not always agree with his politics but I think we should just have one world not a big or little America like he always talks about in all these documentries. I think he is stuck on the cold war of the 40s and 50's. It simply will not work this time around because unlike the communism, there are no heroes. The rich are the rich no matter where you live and they are all doing the same thing. The only
said to be based upon "Carrosse d'or", written by Maurice Lehalle and first staged in 2, and a successful hit movie called Oratorio de trois rome, by 1942, directed by Jean Boyer. This gem was made in 5, and tells of an ambitious dancer, who finds himself caught up with a dance troup called the Belles de Jour, who regularly perform the spectular show "Oratorium" in a casino / night spot. Kelly is charming, and full life, the ever handsome Lesley Caron is a fireball of talent as the dancers' star, and Kelly makes gloriously effeminate dancing partner in a performance that seems to make a link with homosexuality, and the rest of this 7+ film is brilliant, with stand outs including Kelly and Michael Wilding, one night when the Belles de Jour / orators stop to rest where Wilding lives, and Kelly is shown dancing with Wilding's young son on the piano. All sorts are being involved in some way or form, but there are some lovely dancers here, including Jane Morgan, and the dancing numbers are always superlatively executed, with choreography from Kelly himself. Also here is an "unconscious audience" routine which now seems strangly prophetical of the future of mass media. Minnelli makes excellent creative use out all the beautiful surroundings and locations here too. Fab
the big ones and some soldiers of lower rank who participated in War Crimerimes. I already saw that 10 years back but this time I noticed a detail which could be read as a confirmation that the whole trial was a fraud. On the stage the big ones were all presented in the same manner - they were standing in front of a big flag but this flag showed a drawing of a man behind the flag on the same page. Very strange. Who did it and who had the idea to use this kind of flags? I assume it will be the same who brought the Holohooax in operation and I assume it was the Americans. I even doubt it was the Americans because if you are in real "justice power" then you know how you must do things to get the "final-justice" result you are going for. The next question is: who is the man behind the big flag? I assume it' (the man) is a personification from one holistic "judgeship" and it clearly shows on many flags nowadays. So that the judges are all made up from one guy. I find that rather funny. The man behind big flags became always more apparent with some of those flags. And the funny business is that the "man" behind those flags is only visible to me. My wife can't see it. Fun! Oh dear, this man never dies. The rest was a fraud. The Germans needed a punch after a punishment

of several adaptatons of an 2002 British TV series with a certain degree of star-power for the small-screen at the time. It'll keep you occupied while you consider what else to watch! Let's not get to bogged down by the whys and wherefoe. 'Fathers and daughters, if there were less of those and fewer children running around we'd all grow up sooner'...the basic premis is that some people (for whatever reason) seem to be cursed with bad luck. Some are so bad off that they don't want, or should have (birth defect), to live life. While others aren' t so bad, but do everything they possibly ca to take out eachother due to the 'hatfields vs. McCooey' situation. No one seems to like each theter. There has even bee murder, suicide, blackmail, bribes, rapc, kidnapping and lies. Yeah, this aint 'Highn noon'! If it'd been made 20 to thirty years ago this would'a been released as 'Duel in Dimteo' complete with a score by Enio Morricone (If you get the refrence, I'm sure you smile). Now, I know I just dousn' minded giving it away by revealing the title of a film made by Sam Pecchioli in the opening paragraph,
are only some of of the themes in this delightful film about psychopathy and identity (a.k an adam a few short days ago in another post). Rear window was one of Hithcocok' s "minors," (meaning that he felt he didn‚Äô s quite reach the heights of such other films like Rope or Shadow). I don t know if I agree with the sentiment, but I will say that it shares traits with the others. It' s rather ironic that though HITCHCO01. did not give us Rear window, it gives us a world in which our narrator was very real (and unorthadox) for his time. We see nothing wrong when our narration shows up for social events, or dates. This is one quality that noir owes to (the writer and later director), Alfred Hitchencock: the narration is self-aware, if only slightly, of his presence and of the conventions and the mechanisms of film that underpins his character (noir, in case you forgot), and his character by extension, the audience which is watching it. He' s not very "Hayes-able' ' if we are paying to a somewhat common sense (if exaggerated, the line between being a psycho and just being a pervert) view of a dangerous world: the obsession. In the movie, the viewer is introduced into

, features a cast of brilliantly like-minded performer, was directed by the immortary master that was Robert Ebert, and of all the people on the play had a script by Tom Mankowski who I'm sure would have been just in his prime at the time of the production, and is famous for being the head screenwriter of Monsters, Ink. So what went wrong for us? Not much - just basically the film itself, which was no great loss since it was only marginally a musical after the opening theme which features a nice song. The story is this: a young boy named Jimmy finds out that his father has been keeping an oriole trapped in his basement for the last couple of weeks, and plans to kill it. After the oriolear escapes, his search for the bird leads to a series of strange and possibly supernatural events. This bizarre twist set the movie apart from a lot of other films that aren'ttreated as family stories the same as one of those other films, and made the movie into one of those films. The movie was released at Christmas, and became one of the biggest financial disapointment of the year, being released just days before Christmas. Jimmy and Buddy are also characters that are very close-knit and good friends who both want to learn the answers behind Jimmy'ss and other characters' problems and find out the secret of the oriolear's powers.

to the lighting, the clothes and props, the soundtrack, etc., only after it has already unleashed it horror and suspence. The first 20-30 minutes or more of the nearly two- hour movie are unsetttling, disturbing, and unpleasent. During this time I kept fidgeted and felt scared and claustrohphobed. I then forgot about the story's unpleasing nature and let the shocking film take over and envelop me. I knew it was a good film because it got me that way; and because it made me think. Hane-ke uses his cameraman to evoke every feeling and mood that he wishes. The fact is, because I was so emotionally moved by the film while I watched, I am still emotionally torn and debilitatingly unsettled while I am reflect upon my experience. The film has an incredible ending that is even harder and more unbearably sad then the rest of the film. The people Hane-Ke plays with in this his film are not lucky people. They are lost. The end is so devastating, so sad and shockful, I fell as if I'd been hit by an emotional semi. While it was on the top 200 list in Sight& Sound, I was disapointed to see that it recieved such low ratings than other films in in top ten list. It deserves to
a movie where 4 clones of Arnold Schwartznegerr go to a summer camp to battle it to death so the the strongest one can live. Also is it the fact you have Arnold Schwartzneger going to the movies and watching Jason Vorheese go out to kill, thats just creepier then killers going out to seek people to kill. Really, this movie is fun and one that must be watched just because of the sheer retardness of the whole concept of the premise. I would think you could probably buy this now from your wacky tiger guy for cheap, so give it a try. Its dumb, there will be cloning here and their even going to make more sequels to it. That is all. oh and you can learn who will play the mother ship here. The next batman movie‚Ä¶ wtf.. really.. seriously? no no no !!!! I will be honest the only reason i even went was because The Dark One played Scamper in this movie. And it seemed like he would be doing this role and you guys know how I love The dark one‚Ä¶ wait so we get to the end of the movie now which has been a really bad one too.. 10 minutes left of this movie, the other clans are done, mother ships kills her clones. Oh wait mother gets a teddy bear and goes to hug the dear bear and mother ship does a real bad mother fucker move
am able to learn what is inside in a kid mental. The acting of the little kid were impressive because some of them are new actors. The movie is about the friendship between a group kid (Nickelodeon' style), bully, kids who likes to play basketball, and the black kid team.I want this kinds of friendship for me, if it is real or not. Even the kids were doing mistake, they will do a right things toward others. This movie give the sense about how to deal with other kids, at least i get the message about this. I will recommend this to my sister, for her, well i watch it too with her (ofcourse, we see the free showing in the cinema). Thank you. May Allah Bless you. Amen. Amen, Amin.

on they discover the theater is the new laier of a violent killing and may be in danger of dying themselves in the process of bringing the killer to face. One boy in particular, who seems to know some of the gory details is hiding a few shocker himself. Also, make room for the blood and the guts, the guy who cleans the theatre (Jimmy) may be the killer! This was made in 1986 by a small company called Dark Castle, who had other good fims to their credit- 'Deadly Dreamers' (1978) - (This has the same director: Jerry Bock;) a small time classic I will review later!). They also had an amazing name for the guy who normally cleaned the theatre - "Junius" !!! Yes, they are real and a hard group company to find any info about. They also made a nice little thriller titled 'Rock 'til' You Die', also in 18986. They had a cool logo too. Now I want a copy!! This may have had a video release in Europe, but I have only hear of it on those 'other boot t'v only stations'. However it is on IMdb, (The Man who cleans the theteer: Jim Grill (Un-credoit!); Actor: Mark Richards (as: Mark E. Richards) , there is
a group of four people making a lasting impact for many years. And if you add the idea of the idea of using four unknown actors and putt them in some low budget way of productions, plus the idea of making a musical with 18 love scenes (even if you know that the actors are not actually shown making love), you have a double whim that should not work, or work at all! But ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äú, written and directed  By Danny Boyles, succeeding in every way you could even think. All the impossible things above listed work perfectly and make the film absolutely fascinating, making you want to see it several times. The film is a feelgood that does all that any fiction work should do, and despite the weird story, leaves the audience satisfied and happy. ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äú is a film that will delight every view- able audience, because despite the premis, it tries  to be nothing less than a life changing love story. The film is not without flaws, but it‚Äôs a big success in general, much more than John Lennon, the Beatle, and Paul Henderson, the baseball hero, would ever dream of! (And the production is not about sports, but about music, but  the name of  Henderson can‚Äô t be disconnected, which is also in the film, showing there‚Äô s no better name for the film than Yester- day.)  The film may not suit everyone,
went along and I‚Äôm not even certain as exactly what was going on there. The film starts off as an expose‚Äô about political corruption starred Brad Pitt, it moves to the right later on, showing the other side where money drives what happens in politics and then becomes something else entirely after that when it goes off the rails. I think Sayyes did way more than he should of, it would have sufficed to have a political expose‚Äô film that has its bias and is entertaining. I didn;‚Äô see why it had to get so confused. There is also the political issue of a president being caught in the act and going ‚Äòin office, an absolute no no. This movie might be fun but just seems to me to be misguided. 2 34 stars. Also, how come the film starts off and then is broken up into sections with a title then a summary of the last scene? Very odd and jittery. Another interesting thing about the movie was a very funny scene between Katherine Keenan‚Äô and Scott Bakula- I wondered why they didn‚Äôt do something more with that (or were left off when the film was edited?). This is one of three films I‚Äôm watching, The President at the Beach and The World is yours. The President is the more policial film with the lead character going from something to nothing (except for 47 million of course), The Wold sours to something more than the
years ago you might even remember some of the faces as well. This movie was shot all across the United Kingdom in the early ¬ë90s. This is the true picture the press didn¬í t want you see. A perfect album to the scene of the early nineties, one with the bands the press loved to hate, bands fighting against a world that shun them. The DVD has a running time of around 50 minutes and includes such underground punk bands The Lords Of The Discord, Tin Can, The Faction, Cockpit. The disc has a picture quality of good to excellent as is it transferred directly off of the 35 mm film print (as most foreign dvdr' was). There is a choice between English, German, Spanish and French audio tracks. The Spanish audio can be found once again at MIDI level 3. These are very subtitles that pop up every few words of noisy guitar driven punk rock played at top of the volume. As with most underground DVD¬ís, there is no bonus stuff here, nothing except 50 minutes to get your adreline pumpin¬í. You can also find for The Last Great Punk Band along the streets of Copenhagan & Stokolam and in many English towns throughout this excellent series of concert DVD' called Streetpunk Cin. HERE!

go through and give exact examples but I won,t. I will say that i didn' think this would follow exactly as the book did and i didn, mind. The casting was good for the most parts. The exceptions: I don't buy Ryan at all as a lawyer. she was all cute and sexy and no lawyer. Also, the D.A., the guy whom it came out was hired for his looks, is the first "white" guy hired. I don't know how this world is suppose to happen, since from what I hear ( in the novel) blacks are the minority. Then, why is this a world of "racial inequality" since here are more blacks than whites. The rest I don' enjoy saying. Enjoy it for a movie, not for a literary analysis. If your looking for a deep,dark,serious movie, then go rent Seven. But this is not nearly that dark. So I would say this movie is an OK one. For a fast paced movie with some sex and boobs, then this will be a good choice for your entertainment pleasure for a night. As for me, not bad, not great, just OK, same with the rating of this site of C-. =) =D =) =( Peace~Out~! =) * * * =) =D ( 01010)25068=23 5:)4 =P ( :
production value is much higher than on MKB'S series, and the plot is certainly different. By virtue of the budget, the series has a richer color pallette than the other LONE STORies, and most shots at least approach cinmaty production values. It's often hard to classify the production because although it's a serious story, it doesn'y always look it. Sometimes people ask if I saw a comedy that had Martial arts. Yes, I have. It' a certain comedy about Martals Arts. Then what about it? The story is good, and the production value and effort put out, make it one to watch. The entire sound mix is good as are the music and dialog levels. The effects are a little above average and sometimes outright bad, but there are gems here and there, and you should be surprised at the efforts expendated. In the end they pull it off, and the ending makes the pain worth bearing at times."  The reason this series is rated so high on the content score as opposed to the general rating is that there has to be something worthy of watching for some of the production styles and values used.  Misc: A bit over dramatisied but since they paid so much better, it has to rated up." Lone Stars 3 of 3 Stars, 2 Rat. The Final episode:  The final episode of Lone Starts is very interesting. I would

Takako Got≈ç's Karei-nanka Bushitai yo ne which transliterates as Something's Wrapped Around My Waist, 202, but more commonly referred by it' s literal title of Tsumetai yue uchi/A Foggy Day, 1994, 99. What differentiators there are, are 2: 1.  A twist on Western mythology, 2, a little psychological action that has more to it and less to do being frightened by a creep in the house. A pleasant twist is the relationship between the two main leads. They've got a past that is worth considering as you progress through the film, and you'll thank me for thinking that when all is said and all is done. It helps you empathise with something that is a non existent being, even if it is non existant, as the presence or suggestion is there throughout.  If you watch you're, your, eyes on it from the get go, and try and think forensically about what the story is, the presence won't make an appearance, it'll be more of an occur renc, but the absence will make an appearance, with the camera being shy of some of its subjects, it's only when you're, your, eyes start to realise what has been wrong with the characters, as being seen isn' t necessarily
like the film hasn't been thoroughly critiqued before, it's been at that already for a year before the movie even opened. This thread is for reviewing it from a different standpoint. Here's what this movie tries to say, and manages pretty well for what it is: I AM A SICK, CRAZIEST MAN, YOU WILL NOW WRITE SCRIPTS DEVIOUNTY TO MY DESIRES. Maybe 5 minutes into the third season of the American Goth comic, Mr Davis himself, a major presence in this movie, explains the premises: STRANGER THAN EVIL EXISTING WORLD. And this is true to its word. Now think on it, any film that this thread's opening line can be said of (be there any other?), it takes a lot of balls to make this movie. And that alone means it should not be thrown to the dogs just yet. But of course, it' s true enough that a movie like thi s deserves to endlessly get flamed and then some to correct the mistake, but a mistake it is, nothing more, since the actors definitely did their part and the crew behind the camera (except Hutchinson,who's usually so brilliant - a rarefied instance when he, no doubt for a big paycheck in the hope of at least one horror pic on his resume in the new century,
was vaugely excited about watching an episode, since they were obviously a huge deal and influence on their prodigins.  Seeing one of their movies is obviously a completely different animal but still, watching any sort of old footage of fellow performers was always an eye opener, and the expectation of watching some b&ws was always satisfying and just could not get enough.  That and all the comedy bits and shorts were very enjoyable despite being slightly unfunny to a modern, contemporary viewpoint (not bad, just different). Yes, I very easily appreciate both.  Good little flick and I was so pleased I picked one up at a market, this being my first 1938 British thing ever, which was much more like 1940-50's and early 61 period.  I will hunt other such as this, in fact I just did and found a cool one to watch soon. But first up I had on the list The Ghost Train (Dickies Do The Gang) which I found is an earlier 2 reel 1942 short version and later than today' film (which I do want for my collection too). Enjoy it folks and here'slooks at a screen cap a bit unusual for this site since, well just because, but thought how else would you want a pic from a Crazy. Gang movie.  Now more claps, thank You! My God,
coming out, though. Why can‚Äô‚Äô t individuals come up some new spin on material that doesn ‚Äô,‚Äô has been explored to fatality yet? Sure, A Christmas Story is enjoyable and unique as well, but that ‚Äô s been running for years, too, now, yet does not appear to be getting stagnate. Are these scripts gotten in cold, or created by some big, script-grinding piece devices? And, what do they intend when producing these works, any way. To help inform a tale with a message that can reach people every one of ages, in which individuals understand what the writer intents to communicate, or just to provide material that the celebrator will have fun with, which is only ‚Äô,‚Äô that, not exactly what the tale was when to the very first audiences for whom the tale was initially written. I wonder if you can imagine what the first material mugs and also actors meant to and thought their parts would certainly be like, or that they wanted to communicate with their performance. I wager they did, yet I likewise wager they were much more imaginative in there reasoning than any person currently is today. They possibly weren‚Äô‚Äô T attempting to make a quick buck or utilize their big brand as a marketing tool to draw in brand- new admirer enthusiast and re-hype brand name for an eager audience that has actually possibly seen them previously acting in another function. They probably just wanted this to be a little piece
off the deep end - town's innocent teen daughter killed/mutiliated-driving around to her friends with the ghost/ghost like thing is not scary,but you get the point and it is kind a is spooky at least. there are a some gory scenes which I don't think would squek everyone out. (no pun intended) also the dialogue and all that is also well written but I think that the casting is part makes it fun and that there are actually a couple surprises in the film. all in I would say this is definitely a decent movie if you know what you are getting into. and has some cool kills in it too. I think the big thing with this movie Is it was also written,director,and music and the movie score/song is very well done. the story is nice though and well developed and a nice well rounded ending. most slashers are either too dumb or not what you expect for the best enjoyment. this has good kills and a creepy ghost/undead guy though. it also was a nice slow burn I think the only people that will really not be down this movie are like slashe like to be scared and gross all the time. this movie might not fit there bill though it is more creepier with a couple solid kills. anyway I would recommend this one to many horror, and I liked it. also has a cool cultish vib at the beginning.
. It features Michael and Anna on their hops together and what their lives entails working in a movie studio but it also show the struggles and happiness of growing. This is partly an autobiography of Pixar, the company, and how a small start project became a huge company. The movie also talks an incredible amount about innovation and inspiration, with the ideas behind most of Pixars most important movies coming from the employees and what they see in the world around them. The movie also features the process of doing animation and moving forward, with all of the stress and conflict involved with the people that go to the head of the company.  To watch to movie go on youtube, or if your teacher does not permits netflix or youube go to vime, and there is also trailers on youtub. Also try not the watch every trailer as it will spoil it.

it‚Äôa too long and too full, just like the nth bunch, of red- herrings, laughably transparent ‚Äúgot you‚Äù jolz and other cheap scariest-most-annoyingly-gut-wretching tactics to keep you interested in these characters who are quite clearly unseated from both the real world and the world of movies. The only slight differences are that the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù is that of a bunch-o-rich-kiddies(you see? How they flaunt their good fortune and yet are all dystopian!!) and yet the ‚Äúworld of movies‚Äù gives all the big actors the ‚Äúworld-we-know this-one-will die- because-of-her/his-prior commitmment-sometime-in-future‚Äù type role. I am talking specifically about Daisy Ridley -and what I mean is that her part can‚Äôt be explained because if it was it will spoilt the surprise so I have to resort the unelaborated version and it is kind of mean for me- but you will know exactly who & what I am talking about as you see her die -and a bit later so does her co -stars- in the movie. I like you when I do that. It‚Äôll give me a complex later, but I like you for it now- so you‚Äôll just have ot enjoy that toasty
5ft deep pit of snake oil it looks a good move. I just can‚Äô¬Ä¬ô¬Ä¬ò help getting the image of our hero and 200lb of black villian locked in close combat. They start grappling and fall backwards. The villian hits the steel wall and is knocked senseless, Cliger climbs onto top and squeezing his bare neck starts to strangulate him, his fingers squeezes harder until the face swells up like an orange, then his tongue starts to bulges out. I think I will stop there, but how appropriate to celebrate Halloween by sending my friend Jade ¬Ä¬òMonster¬Ä¬ô Morroquin to a hospital with a broken nose and a fractury arm courtesy of the big man Al Cligers. We were all sure that it¬Ä¬ôs Cliver who will hit Gomez down like a pack of cards, but how quick Morroquin is! He smooched him down onto a canvas, clamped a leg around the neck and squeezed like a papa bear does to its cub, this has scared me quite a bit and made me see Cliver the champion in new light.

I love this card, if you get the feeling of what I am sya ting than watch out, there is a nasty fight going down
stuff. Racist tone. No emotional moments. Terrible direction from the screenwritter/directer. Story almost a carbon cooy of the original film but totally failed the attempt. Not a lot to hate but not a whole to love either. We are treated tot he original characters back with some new characters. Even though the trailer was a delight, sadly the movie is not. It just made me have a headache. I think I could explain a lot why the film wasn't good but when your movie is a sequel and your marketing for example is much bigger then the first, you loose that special charm the first movie might have needed more.

and the leading actress, Jessica Hausener (whom you also know in the film Girl With the Pearl Eardring as a seventeen year girl with beautiful pear) is a very good-looking blond and I am very sure she is of a Swedish stock - like Gwimmy Girl, but I just do. NOT. live. this! film. The only character for which I feel sympathy is the main character's mother - Inger and her woes with men. However how the fuck is a character like Johanne to emerge, grow, change, to even have a story. She didn' t even get all her shit together until she married her abusing husband after escaping his house that same night. Come one if you see a woman, abusing infront your house, at least turn a blind eyeball to the other neighbour, who knows what that woman experience at night, let alone abuser, you'd get a raping from the women in the neighbour hood. Johanna doesn t get a story, except for the title. She wants the fairytale and baaang! You get your fairytaled story, you thought you were going to live in one, for the first time, as a child. But what kind! The writer's purpose was to let us into the character's interior so we (i the view) can feel her pain and gain great emphaty and then "live", this film because that is
jump and giggle in a darkened theater (and then head straight for the horror section of the video rental store). However all the dark smoke and mirror tricks do not distract me, being a long time horror lover myself from way before the advent ages of CG. So, in short, as much a fan I am of good, creepy "boogie-in-your -sleep" type of horror movies (from the "Shutterbug" series-shiver-shudder) to "old-school" classics like "The Texas Chain-Chop Massacre") as I am a fan, of the "reality-check", "real-life" psychological night terrories that often can endure longer (for example the ultimate in the genre "The Exorist"). I'm a purver of anything "good" and when it comes to horror-flics I almost always find myself lining in up to see what I have been hearing about. "An idea for good-bad horror hacks and one lints goes a long, rave and 'D'-factor way". Sorry to say, this is not that movie! It's just another lout of "same old" "same-old", same stuff and just so what. Not only is this thing 2008-a-horror-years' old, but it's also tired and dull and lack,luster and
a vased, sitting on a bench near my front window, who I call Billy D. and a whole team of hand puppetry, including two little white gloves. The vessed Billy D, calls our guest, a super-vesseded Mae West, which I do in Billy D. voice that Billy D. he and Mae West are super pally. That is Billy's thing, palliness, when not talking in an Italian accent. Billy D. wants M&M'S real real BAAAADD. They talk to each each other, and it is Billy'wackiest, most demented and, I suppose on my part for indulging him, most annoying segment of my show I have every recorded. Billy's D's talk is very adult and the language is, elliptic, to avoid the FCFs I have the show recorded with. Mae West is very super and the first sentence uter is- "I call my thing a "Vessel thingamagig" and is about as incoherent as my Billy, but also wonderful and I, therefore repeat the whole thing, but there is no way this would be suitable place or even for PBS. Billy D's is quite, quite a character and you would not want him in a room in any way but by PBS telly; he's quite filthly but delightufully so and when I have drunk
in making you focus on each scene; it‚Äôll be hard to take that focus away, even for the bathroom break. It‚Äôs 2 hours of suspensful, heartbreaking drama, with little, if no, uptime to relax. But you won‚Äô know you‚Äôre tense ‚Äôtil the credits start rolling, you realize your back is sore from being hunches over, and that the tension has left your neck. The movie starts with a baffled mother making a report about two dead bodies found in the homeowner‚Äô car‚Ä¶ and progress from there, through the memories and flashback that the mother unleashes. You will be surprised at how the story unveils and you will be devastate by what actually happened, unless you‚Äôve read the book or have previous knowledge of what goes on throughout. It never fails. It will draw the audiences attention and deliver them in suspent with a heart breaking tragedy. The film was all I ever wanted out out a tragic ending. I cannot wait for this movie is come out in US theaters. Not an hour pass without me thinking of the movie. Not a night goes where I‚Äôm not thinking about that last scene, that last shot. Maybe your not a ‚ÄòJodi‚Äô girl. Maybe, every time you think her name, your like, but isn nothing happened. Or nothing happened to everyone else. (We) can‚Äô feel for Jodi. She‚Äôs terrible. She can
too confusing to follow a bunch full grown guys throwing balls, doing stupid poses, and, from what I've seen, not really running a whole lot. The game itself looks way too slow. I'm sure there are lots who enjoy the sport, but I just can work up any enthusiasm or even curiosity. (Edit - perhaps part of my confusion is the NFL'S rule changes to the 2018 format which have made me even less interested in following any lead to figuratively or physically jumping on this bandwagon). Yes , I see how some love it (who doesn 't love to relax around the house, drink a few brews, and watch a game or two?) but I remain fairly apathetic.(On a lighter side, I think the only episode I would have really kept up with would probably be on the "hilarious auditions" - but those are too few & too far between to warrant a regular watch) What're yer reflections? Should "football" (Brit) be a thing in your local area?

a few to see), and possibly the best of the year. It's a bit of a mash of two old ghost stories - "What Really Happedy to Lady Belcher' (1900) and "The Mezzybelle Ghost" , but its gothically hilariously delights the whole time. The ghosts are mainly CG of some very sad CG actors, but they're still quite a lot of fun, and the very good story does have some nice scare moments, some of which really creeped out my girlfriend. Of course, it't not really all about scares, there are good ghost jokes, lots going for the film, with a nice mixture between live actors and CGCGI, and a great ending. Good stuff. 8.5~9/0. Only a tiny downside is that there are some scenes in which the camera is far-away and shows a whole house / village, and when there is a ghost floating / flying it seems to be moving very slowly (this probably was due to the CG and the film was made in 66-ish, so they didn'tt have the best effects back in the days). It' a real pity that the Ghost Train and Dr Terrors House of Horors were never released on Bluer-ray here in Europe, one day perhaps. I'm excited to watch some more Poe films. 8.5/
being a complete and utter lie.... A woman who gets additcted/jacked up with unstable psychedleics has mind blows... No. Such a thing is impossible... Psychadelica cause changes in patterns in brain activity, if you screw up a pattern you can cause the brain to fuck you over and you end getting injured or dieing as things are fucked up hard (i. e, visual/audial hallucinations leading you down the wrong path, you get a thought stuck in your loop due to a chemical screw up of an area, you die from overdose because of all these... Though rare, definitely not a good trip... Also, if one gets the visual illusion of a brick or stone wall dissapearing in a dream... One could jump to one's death never noticing the lack of a visual barrier... These are reality, if you are ever doing shites or L, the worst thing you can see/heard is that you are safe no harm is coming... You are fine, no problem except overdosed and your vision is screwy ... Don 't take something you are not familier wth (even if it is legal), be safe... Don't jack yourself in. Use caution in the matter. Don't just fuck arounf. Take only when the circumstances are right and you and the person helping know what to expect. Don't fuck around and don 't just take shit. If
a morgue of awesome bits that could easily be combined for a new comic that you will definitely enjoy! However, we sadly must conclude that this book will work for exactly no one. Why? Because the comiXology reader won't show us the entire page. It's pretty shitty when you have big panels that get cut in half like this:For instance, look at the last image above, right above M. Echh's (the name they credit him as) signature. How about you need two tabs for your browser just to view the full page? Yeah... not a great experience in our opinion, so we probably won‚Äô t be getting this book via that medium... ever again. Now what about print? It's a hardcover book as has just 32 pages  and is B/C, so $15 isn' t too ghast. Not sure if they have a Kindle version, so if anyone who has reviewed this book mentions the Kindles, then maybe you can look into that as well, if you are one of those people.All in all, it' s a good comic with some cool art,  but not necessarily that fun to read because it has a lot like a short story and it's hard to remember the characters... especially the bad guys, if you know what we mean :) Here's what the company said about it: "When the undead take up residence at
my childhood and thought it would be amusing to revisit it now. The main character, Pernikysh, is about my age, just a few days older, and was born in 1799, or very close thereton, on the same day as Mary Robinson (nee Wollstonecraft), a descent from Richard the Conqueror and a daughter of Richard III (all on this island???). She is sent away to a fancy boardnig school, only comes home on holidays, is raised by her harsh grandmother and finds her old family a bit to stiff at first. Enter John who is a wild boy with dirty hands, the estate they both live next door to is called Smadsmoor, and the plot heats upthey fall in love. Her father starts up in her face to no heed, and she starts up then falls again. So she runs away to the island of Guadlopula, where she meets a bunch of Spanish gentlemiens who fall so mad forher (really, that is how it is recorded in my head!) she thinks she likes too. Then her boy friend turns up and there are other things and my memory fails there, but the climatch is good, she is rescues from the Spanish gents by her love, and she agrees that marriage is the thing. I recall this as being a fun, sweet romance and a pretty easy read, though I know
of the movie came when he met up with the guy he had met during the week. I got the impression that there was an element of danger due to a police announcement that he was missing, but the whole movie felt like a waste of time. I felt like I was in a real life detective agency, with a bad guy, some crime and someone trying to piece it all up like it was a game. The guy had a plan to break into a bank, so it was interesting to see how it happened. I got the impression he had been watching the surveillance taped then he was able to pin all of the pieces together. Overall, this is just an average thriller, with no plot twists, no really captvating moments, just a bunch of random things that didn'texist. The only thing enjoyable about it was that he met upwith the second, and this was a first for him and it seemed like a big deal. If it had gone much longer it would have seemed forced.  I am a big fanof David Fincher's filmography but this is just a re-hashof the last two. 7/19/09 3.5 Star Rating. I was thinking of giving it a 4/19 before I started typing.

involving the characters, such is Theon, Dany, Tyjon, Darth Vador, who all have to prove they are ‚Äúworthy of their family name‚Äù. It‚Äôd be like if in Star Trevok found a bad guy, and decided instead of blowing him up (like some character may have done in Star Wars) he transported that person to your planets court room where you can find out if he is good and evil. That‚Äôs how serious this is. ‚ÄúYou did this to us! You betra- oh who cares are we good and evil or no?‚Äù Okay so that is all good and fine and makes for great television, but that‚Äôs not what I have a problem about with it being ‚Äúwritten like a medieval story‚Äù being that there is no good or evil just people. No we have a problem with the characters themselves, what really bothers the people is that the writing seems to give the characters the feeling they are in a medieval story. I don‚Äô understand it? It just all seems to be very medieval for not really anything reason. Some have said ‚ÄúIf I put in the modern world it‚Äôs not gonna make sense‚Äù. Oh wait no actually they don‚Äôt actually say anything they make the characters. For the characters, if not for the viewers, to be able make a decision on weather a TV character is good or bad. It just seems to be lacking something. I don understand why they are bad so they feel they
Besides Paco saying I'll bury you. The first scene the only problem was the plot. It was a mess. A scene between Pacio, a thai girl and a Chinese man. The second issue is Pacios look. The guy should have been bald, darker skin and muscular. Pacio just doesn't fit the role. Only scene with Jackie is the biggest waste ever and the ending had no point. I have no clue why Pacino is in this movie. After this film he should have just retire from mainstream western movies. He should be doing indie movies and maybe a Chinese movie. He really should stop being in the spotlights anymore and try to improve his acting and maybe that can help him make up for this cliche bs. Don't waste your money on watching his worst possible acting performance ever with scenes that have literally no logic whatsoever. Stay home save your money instead of doing something you should be completely fine with was wasting it. No plot no point, Pacio is an idiot here, its a complete bs of no logic at any point of the story at all. Not a single scene is worth having any interest in whats going to happen. It'll just gonna completely frustrate and annoy you that you bothered seeing this mess. Only reason i watched this, so that i wont feel bad when spending money for something you have no idea what its gonna be like. With this one, you don
some of his movies. It wasn¬í‚Äôtleast I thought itwould. It¬í‚Äôstotally and completely the opposite. This was just plain weird! I didn¬ëtlaugh a whole bunch and the plot is so ¬ìloose¬ì at points that I can¬í‚Äôt even call this a movie! It¬í‚Äôsthe worse movie ESPECIAllly the worst family comedy I have EVERSEEN! It¬í‚Äôs a patethin film for little babies of less than a month. If you somehow fall into a time warp and endup in a world that sucks then this is your film but if you don¬¥t then, please, for god sake DON¬í‚ÄôT WATCH THIS!. The plot is so ¬®loose¬ì that at points I was just staring at it dumbfounded. The way itwas written was pathetic and I have to admit it I reallydo not understand how Mr Qui√∞¬íd¬î managed to make these few movies ¬ìgood¬ì this one seriously was a mistake and an evil one! Mr. Quaid tried his best but seriously it was too much for him! The plot was just pathetic! It is like they never even tried! They didn‚Äô¬ît even make it for children and I mean little children not little adults like me!! I also laughed at some parts but that was because there was some cheezey stuff and this movie had a bunch
beats. The music is good! If you were to ask my friends I listen too hot beats all the way from dusk to dawn, haha, kidding, but you will get what i‚Äôm saying most of all the music is good! The acting? Is great, the actors and actress are amazing! They made each character just so amazing!! The acting gave the characters a life! The story was nothing compared too what one might encounter but the story is great! It was one of a kind really. Very interesting storyline. The plot was not over the top, there were a few things that were weird but it was a very, very believably true story! The CINEMATT is not over the edge but an amazing story about some rock stars that were rockin‚Äô out! The title might be scary or depressive. It‚Äôs about a music manager, Dickie, who is a bit of a psycopatic loses it and is put in a psychotic hospital by the police. Even after the death he sees live scenes of him performing and what not, even the band is still around, why? We all will have too see to believe, or not believe, haha, just, a great movie and I LOVE IT!! I AM A TRUE FAN, lol, kidding, but I loved it. 18/20. HELLO, I LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE 20
give us those stupid straws we wouldn‚Äôt use them. and you know im talking about that new strawless initiative to stop the sea tattle from killing the birds. and yeah sure, it makes sense, and one should stop using plastic straw if one can, except there are times when one needs a plastic or metal straw. for example, they are much more easy for the dapper dude on the go. and if they want to just limit the plastic straws from the biggest consumers such that the smaller company can take over because they have much more to gain even though they don‚Äôr have as many customers, then that just makes even more silly for them to be using paper, and also less cost friendly. for they have to buy them then that‚Äôsl even higher. that‚Äôll just make paper companies gain and we know the impact paper has. it‚Äôll all be no profit, but more pollution. so you can stop eating meat, you can drink straight out the tap and you can be the hip modern eco friendly conscious guy who buyle paper with 100% recycled material but to think it‚Äôs as simple and easy that we should all just stop drinking in public, i love plastic straw as much has the one who likes a good wood fired pizza in an oven set on fire with wood. but how many times have you thought about the source of that lovely wood? and i agree with what she says, if they just advert better,
only released in a double bill or two. The problem of presenting the content of Demoni 5: Hell Is Our Destination lies in the main character of the films. I've seen them both as a double feature on Shudder but they were titled Hellhole and Gallowwalkers. Confused? Well, so am most people it seems. So, let' s tackle Demon 5: Hell is Our Destination as the Italian name. The premises to both films start in Medieval times with all manner of witchcraft and demonology. The story then jumbles past and future, with 21^{st }century actors and, in one's case it a time-jumped demon. The first part being Gowans' Hellhole is the most basic, as John (Dante‚Äô) as he tries to raise the great demon, Ribh. After that, the main protagonisit, a demon hunter called Michael (Daniel Bonaventure) of the Church Vatican is sent in to stop him not only on this occasion on but a few of his other resurrection plans too or is it? Who can tell, but the time jumps and the films are just weird in a truly off-kiltered world. The cinematography and storytelling are not always that of a standard quality by the standards set as I' m not a fan of the most popular of horror genere right now of

‚Äôves been thrown. And it just shows that what with this being the last time we see the people who made Shrek, they themselves should‚Äôvo been fired. Perhaps having an executive overlord who literally has never watched a Shrek before now and is therefore unable themselves to have any emotional attachment? Thus forcing them to oversee all the stories on some kind of spreadsheet while not being swayed by the storytellers themselves? IDUNNO. But yeah that said, it is good enough of the series, and indeed in its own way it is a clever Shrektalogy. Almost a mythical Shrektrilogy is the correct term. But it don beats the prior one, tho I will say that it at the very least ties to it. It also manages to have one of the best-ever musical numbers in anything ever by Shrek. Yeah watch it for the best of that this time. It may not be the end of Shrektales; we shall see: they hint of maybe another one in the movie itself. I could‚Ä¶go find one myself to watch.

And then there are the men who become women. This book tells of one such man (Mary Belle, the Madame of a boarding and gaming establishments in San Francisco) and her experiences and friendships.

The men and women at Dodge Fremonte‚Äôs 1850‚ÄôS boardinh and gaming house experience every kind of pleasure and misery the world has to offer. An expiereinces set in a time and place long gone and gone by. This is a book that may touch any ones experience with the lost history of America. The characters may be ficticious but the events and people are fact. This is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to anyone. It is hard to find now. But if you do you should. It is 401 pages of good fictionary delight that will satisfy he hungrey soul for the days of old America before the dark curse infested its borders. But even those dark times show through the eyes and minds and hearts, of the people who kept alive the best that humanity could. And still can offer. This book does that in spad. Also in the book are some original woodcuts by Gwin Batterton. Gwin will take you back to a time when people were larger tnn than life.
the new capitalist class, the excess and greed displayed by some and its link to the corruption in the new China. What is wrong in a director express his criticism of what he saw in new China. There are lot of old people of these generation who think the same too but don‚Äôt show it openly/or do everything to show by another way than telling it directly, but it is still there, in their lives. She deprived the characters of a voice or a life with the script. In a movie about a play they are just one more voiceless extrainstance to make to statement. The only real characters are Ning and the head director from real life. Xiamou also a secondary character is a bit more shown. But the other ones, are un-englished and could be anything, could die, fall, eat whatever they eat, with no emotion or life. Ning never connected with them, which is more realistic, because she should be like the director, she doesn‚Äôt want to get to close to anybody with such ephermal life, and maybe this way he is trying tell to the modern Chinese, that you better get used to your new life of solitude. The music score at the end, is just another way to critic, with few lines and some references. She shows what does she think. The problem is, she didn't show also what is truth and in some points she is just trying to make you agree the way
the King was not just any King. Far from that. This King was mightily well renowned in all the known world. There was no mountain around that his castle could not be seen from. And the castle was so big that the sparrow was not heard while passing through the corridos between the fortifications‚Äô towres that could be seen from the far away lands. So, you see, whoever was talking about how mighty a King he was, would have been speaking a great truth at that. And, when the servants presented the heroic duo to him he was left at plain speech: ‚ÄûGood luck, Sirs.‚Äú The twos of them bowing and leaving the castle, and in their way out of it, while they were walking through a yard that lay between the castle and a moat around which the King, in his wisdom and far thinking in advance, built some shops, among the shops they managed one with some leather and weapons. And as of the King, he went to his own chained dragon that, there, was fed raw, healthy, steaks. (It had been a healed dragon, once, but the ungratitudinously fed dragon and the ransacked villages had not escaped his high Majesty‚Äôs angered ear and wisely was slacked then as he was now. Now, atleast.) When with the King, the dragon was chained to a wall in an enclosed yard and a

It seemed very Altmania in production, but I guess I was looking too hard. The only reference, aside from Altman, that I could identify with was the Biblical reference when Jeff Brides and Karen Allen's characters are in the cave. The script was kinda tedius, the sex scene between the boy, played by Tom Cruice ( I know) , and the girl in the bedroom window, was too adult for me, and at the end of the movie I was still disenchanted as if the whole thing was a waste of time and talent. Did I miss the point? Probably, and for that, it was my loss. Not bad, but under the surface something went wrong, and I don‚Äô know if it was me. I will check out this one a little later and see what happens. Also I was unable to figure out why Jeff would kill himself by dropping that heavy object on his neck, at the very end. I thought his mom killed of it. Who went with whom? I know it was supposedly a period movie about a Vietnam vet, and I do know about Altma, I do, but this one did it mostly for me, for style.

While this movie is pretty old and somewhat silly it' really actually funny and the Weasel was the comedy part of the film after this movie "Mike Getzner got 5 Mill$ion D$ollars" and made more and more movies after that one. This is a must watch. The sequel "An All Dogs Sleeps in Brooklyn" is also a must. Both movies are super funny though the movies weren it't as great the 2 following movies. The Third "You've got a friend in Me" is so horrible I barely even want to watch it. The Last is "Enough Alrea$y". One of my Favorites I really Love this movie. If you like CosPlAi then I highly recommend that you check this movie out. IT's the best and has way more heart then all the other family films at Disney especially when when Disney still had a soul. I always see if anyone ever watch this film but the answer I have almost always "No" to, so maybe I'm one of the only few people that ever seen this. This movie is great for kids AND Adults. It's very rare that I ever don' forget a movie. The
by this point in the game if I saw a bovine any time soon. After spending so many hours in this game this is kind of annoying. I totally understand that it helps with the immersion factor for the player, however, it should be a setting that is user-selectable or even having a code word to enter that makes the cube turn off if you see a bun and to still turn off if you've had just about seeing too-much-of-the-same thing for too long would be nice. This game has one problem by being a lot by being the way the was in that time-period. With there being lots-of violence in the game so far. I hope that someone is working or will be taking this problem into consideration. Also, isn'y it ironic that there is no cube-turn-on code.... but, I mean, I could easily see that if I only come come onto this thread and read it I could come with a list just like that, so you should please accept my suggestions with-out the use-of cube command word. Thanks in advance, Sir, Kyle Miller. I'm kylemiller and you've been watching the Miller Minute here on our great city. Good night everyone. That is all.

sense of human empathy. ‚ÄúThe American‚Äù is a film with clearly defined morals but one that, for any reason, ignites no moral disgust, revulsion or sense of sympathy/pathological understanding for any of the characters. Even the woman, played as well as she was, felt like a commodity for only the most immediate narrative purposes. For example; she is useful in certain situations for obtaining information. She tells him or, at the time, she is the sexiest of the two people, so they have just enjoyed each others bodies they decide to have a relationship (not that it adds to the plot! The plot only moves forward because of the characters sex lives!!) In many ways the cast actually bring their characters to life well enough for us to really get to know who these people really are. The ‚ÄòPrize Fighters‚Äô of Tuscanny come across very well, likeable enough, until killed, and George‚Äôs girlfriend is actually a character with her eyes wide close and her chest pushed up high and her lips like a bow. These are only tiny hints however to how the director feels regarding either character. He lack, not only the intelligence to create characters worth a bit of effort, he also lacked in the ability to fully immerse us in a morally complex story or situation. The film has no moral base with regards to it protagonist. We are never given the chance. But it‚Äô not the only bad thing this film
the highly chorographic use which Kubrick puts to the actors and their faces and bodies, the recurrent references throughout the sound and music, and to its classical yet minimalist references, such as with Leonid Tsokorov playing Monk and the recurrent use in of the music from the Tchaiku music. The way in  which the lighting and settings are used draws us into a dream world that lends to the otherworldly notion that is suggested in the movie by way of Clarisse and the possibility and potential threats of regrad to the TMA. In an interview I watched, the director pointed somewhat indirect comments to Kafka‚Äôs The Castle. There also seems also a nod to Frank Baums The Witches Of Wizard of Oze and an undercurrent to Alice In‚Ä¶Wonderland and that which ‚Äúfell down the rabbit-hole‚Äù and entered an alternative reality that both children and adults can read into and interpret based on how adults can often misunderstand children, see through the vener of a child‚Äôs innocence, as well  how we view different aspects of our own nature, psyche, senses. I would imagine, that they were perhaps suggested or inspired somewhat more directly by the film‚Äô‚Äôs literature source The Sapper Of Fall: 16 Lines In Echibs Of A Childhood Gramer By Yevgeny Kuzmin Of his collection Of Puppies which he wrote
accent (or maybe is real!), but I do not speak enough German to tell you if her character would sound authentic enough. I felt her presence in this was more important as her character. Aliza Gur, what a beauty. I admit that I had no idea what she looked (really looked like). I only knew her as ‚ÄúOlive‚Äù from Forbidden Fruit (1964). Now I think it is so funny that Forget To Remember this movie as it has George Chakirisy in it also, as this is a ‚ÄúMan-Women‚Äù picture. Both actors (as they were in both movies. You should realize how silly I am! (which of course I can‚Äôt help myself). Yet, the two actors are also connected by another picture and if either of you have seen the movie ‚ÄúThe Greek Tiger‚Äù (1961), you will see them together. Then, by looking at the IMDF listing, you would realized that Gur also appeared in the third picture/film they are a part. When I really read all their movies at one sitting, I was stunned to see the picture ‚Äú100 Rifle‚Äù (116) (and both in a ‚ÄúClod Hopper‚Äù picture) and George as ‚ÄúWilbur‚Äù (one that I bought a few years ago, and in which I have yet too see). So, as I said a number of times
be the focus for a project run by a colleauge of Carol Robinson at West Dean College.   It features Jean Simmons at her height and although I had met her once I have never heard or learnd a great deal of detail about the film or how it came to light.  It was only at the Oscars that I finally learnt which part of it inspired the design of Bonds‚Äô wonderful dress in the film ‚Äì that fabulously sheer crinoline thing; it was based on a Jean Simmons costume! The other great thing is that the College is located in one of West Sus‚Äô most beautiful Arts and Crafts buildings; here is the glorious stairway ‚Äì  not far from where this blog takes its title from ‚Äì and also within a kilomet or so of where Chawton is ‚Ä¶ . the home country of my favourite Jane Austen hero, Edward Ferras, of course!  and the original publication of Prides And Preferences (Junior version but still wonderful! This is the paper bound hardback version published before the first paperback versions came out).  Have a look at this short video created about the Sensing History project at West Dean ‚Äì and wish me well in a mad mad mad dash across the Chans as soon as I hear news of the next course ‚Äì they run every summer and sometimes winter too!

as a genuinely scary movie, despite the obvious limitations. It‚Äôll never be held in the same regard as anything out there, but it deserves some credit, in my opinion. It doesn't get any better than this in the independent world of horror. Sad thing is I had to dig through a ton of sub-par crap to get to this gem, and the vast difference between what I saw there, and what is presented here is a bit to harsh to digest.

enjoyment from an action-thrilIer film for a long time. The film has twists, action & suspense at every hand and some great acting from well know and some new actors. Very enjoyable, I give it four stars. The film stars Jamie Lee Certez, Rachel Weisz, Cillien Murdoch, Hugh Dancy, I am sure I miss some others that you all will be more than more than familiar. I think the film deserves to be more than one of the best action-thriller films this summer. -Karena, 4 stars.

imitations of people in the band. I haven‚Äôt seen it before‚ÄìI read a review saying that it was a pile of crap. And because I‚Äôm an idiot, I‚Äôve watched crap to completion, but only this once. I think that the main reason the movie didn‚Äôtimpress me is that each song is a little bit shorter and slightly altered than its counterpart, and some are even masques by other musicians, and that really took away the power I would experience from hearing each full song, which I was hoping the movie would be based on, but it isn't; it‚Äôs a collage. I feel that if all Beatle songs were played out long enough and uninterrupted, it might have moved some people‚Äôs emotions at least to some extent, but it could have been more powerful had each song been left on in its full state. To have so short bits of artificially rendered songs was like hearing bits from the radio stuck together in chunks from different time frames. It isn't quite there. S. ‚ÄúSgt Pepper is great [the film]. This is not real music, it‚Äôs a buncha kooks making nonsense noises,‚Äù Pistor, S.P.P.T., Sgt. Pepper, a Great Experiment. P. Smith: Beatles Banned on British TV and Radio. If you want to listen to how songs really are, I can refer to
, and the worst vampires. I mean.. seriously the acting isn`T even that good (you know, the guy who plays the teenage vamp was too good to run off with the girl instead he became a vamp forever..) the only thing bad about this show, is the acting. And by now noone actually believes that a 16-old-girl is going to kick our ass.. so lets drop it with that crap. So, never again will I ever see an eppiside.. or two.. or five.. or.. 11... I am done with this crap. And for those who are watching this... go play in the street, or do something useful, like watching Buffys. This sucks.. pure bullshit from top to bottom. And james Marst. Ugh, worst actor ever! 2 6/24/2003 (2000s) Update: Just thought I`d stop in again to give this season a second chance since it got a little better. This is one that I might even stick with, however. Update #2- 9 13 04 The last two or 2 episodes are worth watching. One in which 4 familiar characters enter the picture, the last original vamp. Which is a big surprise, but youll know why if your up on things, such as what happens in this episode of Angel. Anyway after that they cut-off part
be very good. But I was pleasantly suprised. I was suprise at seeing Sissi and Ted (Blackhawk Down) in this. Also, having heard him in interviews, I didn't expect Denzel to put much energy into this (thought he would just phone his performance). I found this just like Lonesome Dovalry and my favorite movie of all times Gunfighter and I wanted it never to stop and I definitely recommend viewing. I didn‚Äôt get to finish the 5th part, of the mini series, but I will have seen the other 2 before long. I have also viewed Lonesone dolavery 3 or 5 times. I like to watch movies and series and even listen while doing something else as I am very busy. But with this min series I just had my ranties and had to focus on this. I am glad it was just a 3 part series. I am not real fond f 12-15 hour series, especially one‚Äô which could easily been half that. Another little piece of suprise was that in the first 2 parts Mr Washington' s scenes were towards the ending, which I found very suiting. I look ford in viewing the 5th and final part. I really have no negativity to suare. This was one of the best western mini series I have view and definetly one of Denzel' films

The first game ended up so poorly in the end that, despite how great it was, I just wasn't that interested in picking it back. On the other, I hear the second one has the same formula. Does it? If not, I'll put it up on my play list.<p,>Sandra: that guy's on her hit list. I'll never trust a reviewer to make me interested in anything. It's all a matter or personal judgment. If I like it I'll play it, who gives two shakes about how terrible is for everyone else at that. That is one of the beauties and flipsides' of the indie market. So, Walter, I'm going with Sandra on that one. <P></font id><font face='times new romant'> Axe I'm with you.

about is story is terrible. I feel Jesus as a person is someone you cannot play a man but acting a divine being like Jesus is like playing an angel or something like Jihu, but nobody should do that. Here Jesus is presented as a mere man who finds his soul mate in Mary and asks for her hand in Marry and then married her. The film did not mention miracles and wonders Jesus did to claim Himself being the son Of God but they claim him to have made just one wish and the sky is that moment was clot... and they ended the movie. The title of it does matter to me. Such people who are trying get Jesus as a legend (and may not dare to say legend because Jesus is not one) will one day be held fully responsible for their works by the Almigh God, like me. -Rashidur Rahman Mithun (Tepon) My rating: 1/5 stars More user reviews and recommendations: http //www.imdb.ca/ title/tt4586260 #16 of Hundred Wor...

Rewind the time machine back to when all the film noirs were being made, and look for a remake. But if like me one‚Äô chilled with Chilling at the weekend, and is not looking for the more difficult films and finds a Chilling on the shelf that you have not have scene for a while, please do try this one out, I know I was chilled watching it myself. And an interesting fact, as I write this we have a new grandaughter, this is a great time to play Chillingly with grannies watching films too. Now her names Ellie, but she could also have been Nellie, the film follows the fate and the time of Nelly. Starring the superb Sean Connory and a host more interesting characters, and a most unlikely ending too. With films like this I often wonder why more film re-makings do not look at the lesser known films and those that deserve to be noticed again for their stories then one would find to be looking for, this is not a chilling of a real film noir but more a psychological story of love gone horribly wrong. One would make a nice story, especially with just starting a new family. So please Chill with this one. Now as one would say, one could be on the verge and one could have been so much in love and then it all goes wrong. With out spoiling it for you, a well to do
a real "romantic-comic" manner, where a bit of a mix is in place (a bit gag and prone for farcical humour to start things off), the humblesque fumblics turn into a romance with a really unusual (or actually unheard of) plot to carry it all forward: The main characters get together, as a cute and budding romance, only to have it go to a weird and unexpectedly "terrible marriage", before the obvious eventual split happens, as reality hits at the end. (What with his work, and her commitment to his stuff.) The film is a mishmash, with barely any of the characters likably sympathic (unless you'd be romantically preconditioned), and being really pragmatic is not likely to make things much better... This film is a mess, with an odd "sour" twist put in to round off what is otherwise quite a good romcom (it is at the very least what gave me the feeling that there is a new film to watch, even of this kind!). No, it does rather hit hard to carry it forward as a really big favourite. And maybe that is the point of the whole thing, as a "waterside film". Uncomfortable and a bit out of sync to carry it all forward at least as an intelligent (as a classic, at that): The best thing about it is
guy that he killed was brilliant and classic. One of Coppolla' best. The soundtrack is great and like the movie GoodFellass, it'll be timles. My favorite scene is when Trilli is dancing with George. I also liked when Starks and Patti were fighting. " I like to watch." was an awesome movie. The editing is fast and to right tempo. Godforld Coppollas is a filmmaking titian. His movies will be enjoyed by many generations to follow . This is a great movie and needs to stay in print the way it is shot and the story was told. Godfather 4 was not neccessary at the end of the trilogy. But, this movie was. One of the great filmmakers of all-times, the master of the gangster movie, Francis Ford  Coppolla (my favorite director) was on target this time, in my mind. Too bad DeNiro can't duplicate his role as Trillane like he tried with Al Capone. The real Godfather. George in this film can play realistc. Cause the part is written realistically and Vince and Raynold do the same as they did with De Niro and Robert duval was part of the class. James Cann is alright too, but this movie is the film that put him on the map. Not DeNiro, Coppolas, Robert de niro was
is still by a mile the better version, with Ed Birnest playing the ill-fat old dude who meets with mysterious death after a phone-booth conversation. This one has a much larger budget and features Dennis Miller playing "a man shot dead on a Manhattan street only to find death was just the beginning." OK, I'll buy that, but it wasn is really a man with a grudge against the pharmaceuticals, and she is the hot chick of the film. She wants to avenge her ex-CIA lover, a pharmaceuticus of evil who has disappeared to Nicaraguan. Sure. But at least it features a nice cameos of Dennis Franz, Robert Downey Jr and Huey Longo. There's also some very good acting, especially from Denis Miller, which surprises me. But it'll be remembered mostly as Wes Craven movie: It'll probably become a cult movie for the 99%ers. Too long, too dumb; not too well directed by the once great Cravan, who' just got caught in the net of Hollywood. Thumbs down! **/5 stars **. It's not too too too too cool, don'cha know! :) What happens in between the murders at the airport ? And why is the FBI always in the hospital when there's a death or a missing body? It's not too too bad as I believed that the film

And then, have been involved here and their on the website, for this ‚ÄúEmpty sky‚Äù show,  for the public, my hope to get more people aware of the creative theater work that this company does.

the late fringe of 21st. Also, the shooting settings were superb including with shooting in the rain. Especially, when it snarled in a city like New Zealand, I felt like I want the leading actors also. It feels like you are thinking about, "Where do I pull it at the same speed here and now?" This is the best thriller of 10 years. On sale this is a must watch masterpiece. This is a film that can be seen proud for the Japanese actor. I also want to make it for the director! (I hear the news that director is also from Japan) Also Nine Perfect Strangers Movie seems interesting. If it is a movie that does not move so many people also you should go to it. Do you go!? Do not you want to rewatch!? I have heard that the director works with a movie again, I will wait for it. I want !!! It becomes a long movie, but I hope that you will not feel you want to go with a good flow. I, too, will be your best film this month! !. I want so, I want the Blu ray that I want to see a lot! (My bad) Please watch it, please the Blu ray (The Bludray is finally for sale) I want you. It's the best feeling that the movie theater is still left. It will go to the director! ! Do your
the rating above 7!! She is the cutest little girl there ever was, just 10 years young here, so adorable. She is in a terrible situation, while her mother has done drugs, for money, and not much has gone right in her life, her father does care for her. It‚Äôll make a great movie, probably all the more poingnant and gutwrought when we see her dad‚Äôd not too far along drug history, what was it just like 20 years or something, he and his wife at the same party? He said he was a hardass, but that wouldn;‚Äôt fly forever now, would it, wouldn;t you just up an leave, I sure think. And the dad dies. Another beautiful little girl also good is Lacy J. Chabot, 9 years old, or there abouts here, as the nasty step-sister. Great scene the children throwing some firewood at her window, she is scared, but then the mother says go for it, you missed 15 times, but no, you better start to run. Then getting burned by her at the end, that scene is quite well filmed by this production, and more. You love the very young father-like man who takes on this child, even though his daughter from his late wife wasn;t too happy about it, which wasn‚Äôs her dad‚Äô that her mom wasn‚Äôt happy about
Rhimes and the music was good but that is all I have. This doesn' have as much energy as the other 2. What I liked about the 1 and 0 were the characters. In this one I wanted to slug Darius every time he appear onsceen and what happened was that was how the movie ended with Darius being slugan in the face. Just not a feel good type movie. It was actually a bummed me cause I thought it would go with a solid finish. Felt like a big waste actually. Sorry to say this if anyone read this, even if very few do this. It is also bad to see this film make it through without a rating system of any kind. Too much drugs and sex and violence to not have someone know. This is a bad situation for children to watch. It sucks. By the way this is more so for young adults to mature folk. My kids would think this cartoon. Too much sexual content and drugs and violent action. This is for adult viewing. Very disappointing. P.S.: It is rare that I like the female characters of these movies but I did not here. They could have done something really cool. Now I just want to know how they can turn this film around for the third film in the trill. I would take the first 3rd of the 1st film of the first movie, the first part of this film, the first part from
don't buy it. Instead save your money and go to Phamly Video and watch Phat Pimp, Phantom of Paradiso and other truly entertaining films. Phat Pump, Phat Pulp, Pink Flamingo, Patton, Peeping Momm, Paper Clips, 21 Days, Pornography - the list is endless (and some are even on the same shelf). One other interesting feature of Family Vide - there is a 50 inch high definition screen, something unheaard of in North Carolina. See you there. Oh, and watch out for Fanny C. Fanny's not a very good girl, and I don think she even likes popscicles and lolipops. Fanny may be a bad, bad girl. But, you know, I understand: not being ableto find a popscicle at your local popsicline can drive a girl mad. Try a family vide, you most certainly won'ta bad, bad boy or girl who just ran out of popsciceeples in 30 minutes. Phat Pimp lives three doors down, Phat Pamp; it'a funny man, yea phat.

So every time something would come up with horses, I would rush over to the TV just in time too for his death at about 54 seconds in. Every. Time.. Now, I skip over this movie. It makes sense. He‚Äôd be a mess up there. Maybe he‚Äôd jump off his horse instead of falling. Then again maybe not, this movie was a feel good movie and I imagine his death was meant too. The death of a horse would bring it down and make it mean there‚Äôs no redistributing the end of horsemans lame self‚Ä¶ So Walter, Godspeed. You are a favorite too.

Worth a watch just before you keell over. You‚Äôre not the only one. If you get a hankering for pizza, go get it‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve got some left. You make a good point about eating a lot of pizza; this is one of the sad things in life for some.  I find I don‚Äùt do anything about it. It‚Äô s
promos then most girls would think it would be a pretty corney show with romance and scenery. What made it entertaining for me was the fact it had plenty  sex scenes and nip slips. While people were expecting it as another typical prim-thyme show with just a few lesbains. Instead of telling me that this is an actual sex themed TV for gay girls. I wish they had something comparable, if every other show can have an ad or clip to let you think what the show is going to offer to, then why not advertise gay themed shows!? And stop trying ot be a lesbo version of Will and Grace! Soooo‚Ä¶I dun now how to watch this on youtub, youtube wil not let me post it cus it is a copyrighted video. But a friend sent this to me, it is the first ep. I have embedded the first part below but a whole, entire video is longer. Watch at your leizure. So where you the show? You might get some idea of the writing before you jump the gun. The creator of this show comes pretty clean and says it is going for the lesbian version 1.80 cale of Desperate Housewives.  What I notice in the show? it is pretty lamer. But for me it is all about the sex! Enjoy and please make sure to look at other clips by Ninetyn
us will gather, usually at someone that has a large enough TV, and we'll watch crap movies. We have a particular love for the Troma films, which is easy to do, considering that most of them are 30 minutes or so. So, the other nite, I pop in Sammy and Roses backstabbin' blues, and I say to myself, "self, you're gonna LOVE This movie!" and the three of them, 2 boys, me of course. So, It starts, we've got our drinks, the popcorn's ready......and the movie JU-CKESS!!!!!!! It was horrifying, absolutely wretching. After about almost 5 minutes of boredom, my 17yr-old brother leaps up screaming, "Is that a REAL MOSQUATO!!!!!!!? WTF IS THAT!!?" I responded, rather loud, I believe in a tone of disgust, that was a person in a really gooood mosquito outfit!!!! Now, Sam had already left after 2 minutes, so, it'd be just the 8 of us left to watch this crap!!!!! At this time, my brother runs to his friend's house, as does my friend. So, we've 2 left to watch this crumby thing. So, the movie gets to the part where he "transforms
on the ver‚Ä¶, uh ‚Ä¶, moon who has a crisis of faith. The special appeal comes from the fact that we don?t always have much patience with astronaut film characters when the technical side is underplaying and exaggerating the thriller element, or one that wants to be cool. But this film succeeding of putting all of the drama in the dialogue. This is one the rare occasions when you could be moved with the astronuauts talking to their families on phone. The film‚Äôm sure one of the best that starred Tom Hanks. He won an Oscar for The Da Vinhy Codes and should have won it twenty years later due the Moon. I guess he won‚Äôt will have another chance for that. Anyway, I am definitely going back to watching this film. Maybe somethimes this year. I cannot wait. It‚Äôs fantastic and it really moves me. The end is maybe one of the craziest end to a movie of all times, to me. It is maybe one the the greatest endings to end a picture. I wish for this movie to never disappear from my eyes.

Now somebody (the filmmakers themselves) actually want to give theimposters some money from the original, claiming that the film is the"natural complement to the original 76 film."<br type=&gt;'_mSOmLk;pVk;kWk;cwVrk;e2k;m^ZKVZRk)^e;pZaKZwVr,f2k;&amp;&#39:pVa,f,fVkP:k&#39;P;ak,nXFVZVkW&#23;k,Z*V&#40&#49&#51VkOzk,GZR;a,fNXZ;m&#54WZV&#240:bVfVa&#61kRZa&#42;a&#28;a&#21&#48V;a&#517*k&#40e#49&#48Za&#43&#61&#9(E&#43&#58&#86&#92&#57&#9VZRz&#67&#71&#5Z&#84#r&#49&#q;&#42P;&#7Kj;f&#23?&#MZRf#
and civilians who have been, are, continue to be and are likely continue to die in it. I got pretty emotional myself. 24/7/22. The movie stars Anthony Boyd (also a producer) as Nick Burns, a US soldier in the Donbas region who has been trying his best to kill the enemy as quickly and painfully as possible. Unfortunately for him. Like his partner. The film begins in the deserted village of Avadeiv which reappears throughout, leading Nick through villages and cities to show him what his work has done to them. Avdeive could be Krasnohorivke. Also from the Donbass. Now. A film like this won‚Äôt win awards. But it certainly should. Actor Anthony Boys of 1963 and a film crew of mostly Ukrainians spent four weeks document Nix and his experiences. The result was ‚ÄúWelcome to Donbas‚Äù. And that is exactly what you get a little of the original video game ‚ÄúWolfirem‚Äù in your face view, which makes you think of ‚ÄúThe Last Action‚Äù in the end with the American. The next war movie I‚Äôll see. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know what war really means. And to understand the suffering and horror in it. And to give you some ideas about how to die. 10 in the movie. He will be released on May 29
appears to by a single unbroaded light to make this most unfun programme about unfun things funny by the rather unsteady hand that has put the UK‚Äôs comedy on life‚Äôs support. Not only are we now in the era in politics in the USA where the concept that a president may be forced from office as there is evidence he has broken every law, he has murdered, extorts and intimidates but, as if making The Simpsion‚Äôs episode American history X didn,t give enough away that history is so absurd, that same administration have now let an ally be attacked in order to make the point that they will have nuclear missles, a promise only to be expected from a movie villan. In response, the EU, who haven‚Äôt got along for years and are in their own long term crisis, have finally realised they are no longer a family they have failed to see for decades and finally decide they are better off without the US telling UK and who they trade, or rather how. Good for them, I say, even if the plan is half bakced, that the US should hold up a mirror to Russia‚Äôs own problems as they decide to make a grab at some scraps they can no-what isn even scrap. Not only this but it appears there may be a plot by the current administration to remove a new president for an old one, unless they also turn rogue and find a candidate that at least the US
, pillage and mutilate a more cohesive story, and made it into a two hour thriller with no significant character development or interesting story. What's more Crichtons stories are generally interesting enough to read when you have no choice. But made into an action flick, they are a worthless piece of trash...just like the other films based on Crichton' story' or ideas' and movies we got in the years passed. Even 6th day, Congos predecessor, which was supposedly inspired from Cocoon: The Next Generation(which was based on Criterion) sucked terribely. But Congo is by no far the worst...it wins a Nobele Price being the worst movie ever. Congo is a movie that is supposed follow a Congo expedition looking for diamonds. Only they discovered a whole bunch of Congo'nites that were trying to escape the war, which is not much of a surprise. They go inside the junge, to be captured and "melted" to oil. The rest of movie is just a bunch unimaginative cliche's: One person that is always in danger, one that wants save the others and the one dumb person that brings everything to a halt and slow downs the entire plotline with his or her stupid plans. The list continues wuth some stupid gorillla that knows the location of the whole expedition and hates the evil guy.
to a man she rememebes. It is her long time lover. From then this couple shares many moments together. All over the world (when they look like) but, in the end, he has to run again‚Ä¶..He has to finish his job as an assassin. But he doesn‚Äô t want to. She is so much more to he. If they could be together she would have a chance to finally live the dream of becoming one of the famous DANZIGER dancers! What happens? Will he run away? Will she try to convince and stop him? Will they end up in Miami or die there ‚Ä¶. What happens next then? Will it all fall to pieces again?? Or will a love win, like the music, maybe even with Lisa? Will she meet her true other self in the end? MAYBE!??? The book is totally about love and never giving up. You will love it! More than once.

up, some unexpectedly so. Stories were told from a new angle. The biggest surprise of all, a little personal one: not everyone of the series main-cast showed up. And even those, who weren‚Äôt there, like Lums, didn, appear on-screen in some form: as a newspaper headline in Gaffigan‚Äôs desk, as a photo in some of Tim‚Äôs memories. Tim, who is the point of view of the movie, also ties a lot together. It‚Äôd be unfair of the movie to not show us his point of you, so he gets a lot of voice-over. It‚Äôll also be fair to say that we‚Äôd be lost without them. A good number have rewritten the history of homicide in a number f ways and more than just by the name of being on a tv show or playing Lt. Howard. He‚Äôs had a lot of stories told, and with it a lot of new stories to catch up on, so now he‚Äôs come to tell his. It‚Äôs always nice to see a show that wraps everything up. It seems to happen more-and-more rarely these day, which is a shame, ‚Äôcause well written series are meant to be that way. If you aren looking for some closure, then maybe you should not bother to get the book, ‚Äôthough that‚Äôll do much more than that. It‚Äôs more a retrospective
However it's not too impressive as a drama either. Mckenzie Astins(?) has a girlfriend with cancer, and he pretneds she's fine as to avoid giving the truth about her fatal illness.<br/>  But this movie is more than just a teen comedy. It's about real teen problems. It's not a serious drama movie(the last minute ending was not so great), but we see MK is struggling to deal without his grandma, and to deal with his friend who may have kidney problems as he's often tired, cold and not eating well, so likely his blood is not well either. So I don' thong he is just being a jerk. His acting is good performance, because you can feel his character.<b />  <b />He doesn want to embarress himself as the friend(Alex Pettyfur) is now on the highschool team, however he may not qualify once they do the blood test.<B /> <p>[edit on Nov-72012 by Fyrestar]x4</P)>]]>]]>84>][[[[1]11>))))>><><>>11>><<<<x5<<<<><x5<><p><t>[[[11,][[![[O]O>]>]>]O>]>O,[=
Smith), its new chief medic, discovers that the wacko, murderer-prisoners have never stopped rampant unlawfuhl activity. They're still out to get him. Ethan begins receiving messages, notes and blood markings, left by a group of disgraced rebels who refuse the go down quietly into eterniti. They must have justice for their unjust deaths. It's only a matter a of time until the prison is seizing terrorily, and everyone becomes a pawn. Nothing is what is it is seems... Who is behind the dementia and devilry? Is it the ghost of a deceit? Does Ethan become another prisoner, doomed to keep the prison open? More questions than you could ever answer, and a little too much blood. The only good thing about the movie was the directorial work and the acting. Unfortunately things were unfulfilled: for example the ending falls far more than 4/5ths short of expectations and the music is quite annoying. Do yourself, your friend, and your family, do everyone in the whole world a favor. When this movie comes on don'n change whatever you've got, in your hand, turn the button, turn the set. Donn' turn that channel, don't touch that thing, leave it right there for everything's all. Because, "Pride, Prejudice, and Peeves" just happened to be
surprise I didn‚Äôt recognize him, because of his pretty strong voice over in his regular radio show. I think he did wrong to hide his face behind a black wig for this movie, the first time, I thought his is a young man till I see the haircut and it was to late on the second half. It is too bad because he is a very handsome man, in addition to what I know of his talent as a radio talk show, I think he could carry strong role in a movie if he is given the opportunity. Overall it' is not worth the money or time. I believe that this was made intention for a specific TV demography like his popular show on ABC radio. I think the movie could be entertaining and catchy if it was taken into consideration more TV commercials related to their daily life rather that what it is right now. Also the background music took away a little from it and some serious dialogues and situations were very shallow. I was surprised when there was a fight scene between the boss who'd hired them and the superman team. How come this average guys can kick somebody strong like that? Then this guy's teeth came off for good. I liked how the fight scene was presented, but it was just inappropriate. Once again I could appreciate the idea what was mentioned in terms of the film title. Unfortunately, I rate this movie as 5 out 9 possible and I cannot recommend to anybody to take the time to

a pile that some producer slung together by rounding kids up, giving each a few bucks, letting ‚Äòem have a beer at night, filming at 1 fps, and stitching various bits together with a bit of CGI to cover up the horrible acting. Lest you mistake the horrible acting for something, there is an out of focus shot while standing in place that last an entire page of script. And I‚Äôll let you in a little mystery ‚Äì he‚Äôll do that again in a later (I want to be generous, but I know I‚Äôm just not there) scene. No one gets hurt, but the poor kid that played the part can look forward to his IMdb not being index to all starring ‚Äòacting roles‚Äô if it is today. His second film credit is the same way. If you can bring yourself not to laugh, you never realize there isn‚Äôt a transition between a page turn and the next line of dialogue from another ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt a dialogue that can be edited, but rather a soliloquay that we‚Äôre allowed in on. This whole film is little kid wannabe acting. The only things that really make this worse than something I could have put on a VHS camc order from a 1986 mail order catalog (the quality isn‚Äôt even that, but the horrible ‚Äòamateur‚Äô acting is.) is the dialog is beyond that. The dialog is
tempt a musically gifted woman to spend a little private time with him at the piano. Or maybe to be more contemporary, you can think about "piano man," the term used to describe a very attractive person for some ladies, but with little substance in most cases to speak of. As someone that has enjoyed performing at all levels with other women professionally for close on thirty five  (34!)  wonderful, challenging and gratified years I would just love to add to the discussion the following. Anyone want it?  Anyone?  Surely!  Good!  It' s not very funny but sometimes as that ad says "you won before you even start. " Let the games commence!  The first thing from a performance stand point that you need to accept is the reality that to have a chance of survival as a duo piano team for performances requires a high level of professionalism and a very strong work ethics with the same basic practice principles as you follow if you were any soloist at the top of your form.  Without trying to make it sound easy, you are basically a solo pianistic artist except at 156 beams you might as well only be at 72! You will still face your day at the office as a duet pianistic team with the same or more challenges than just playing solo.  Only in this case you can only depend on yourself and more often not the person sitting on the bench next door. 
a little less out it then them. It‚Äôs the same sorting problem with Madeline. I enjoy hearing the book but other than that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve watched with several other books. The movie was alot of fun and I enjoyed the animation team‚Äômoving‚Äôto things in the picture to give it more of an effect. Especially when the snowball fight breaks out. There‚Äôre a couple of characters in this movie that I‚Äôd never seen before and I wasn;t sure how they pertained to the original book. They did give me an impression that the snow and snow falling played a bigger more important role tha I though.  That‚Äôwas the impression that I came away with after watching it, the movie. The impression that I gained after reading Madline in the Snowy Mountains had little more than looking out from my dorm at a snowy town in Westmoreland State University while trying to finish that book up. I guess it‚Äôll be one of thosethings where I had to talk to someone elsento make sure I had the right idea. (or if my kids really meant what they‚Äôre saying)Other than the animation issues in the movie, it kept me entertained for a little while which got me to buy the book to figure out what the movie was about in relation with what the book was. This story really does help to open up the imagination for little kids. Reading the story was cute, I‚Äômemember
and the only thing really to cheer was the acting of the two leads, Kellan Lutz who plays the heroic vampire, Aro (see below), and by Ashley forks who plays Victoria. Loved ‚ÄòTwlight‚Äô. Loved ‚ÄòNew‚Äô Moon. And my love knows the depths that love can take: i.e. over $80 on DVD‚Äô s. But this was beyond bad, and now I know why it got such awful reviews, unless the critics were being paid off? I mean this was a complete rip-off. I have read the source novel by Meyer, and it was a great read. But this film was just utterly atrocious. The film maker, Chaplin should hang his/her head in immense dismay. The story line, direction and acting talent was all clearly absent , and all in the aid of making a profit? Makes one sick. I would not wish this garbage upon my most hated enemy. It would only make the world a better place if this clich√© was destroyed ‚Äì which, unfortunately, may not be easy. The vampires are bad, but so is this film. Woe! Woe! WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How can this be? The audience took great delight over the acting talents of Kellan Lutas and the equally talented Ashford. But if this garbage has to be paid for by the two great lead roles, then it is un
themes. A gypsy girl is sold to an Arab and the latter sell him back. She is the slave/sex-object of a bunch of sadistic Arubians who are addicted to boxing and hard drinking. The boy she fell for on first encounter flees back home. While the old grandmother of his is in a cave and has been hiding a valuable Turkish carpet for 55 years, she is captured by the Arabs and killed, the dog has to go back there for the first encounter. The boy comes back because the girl beged him to marry here, but because of the incident with the grandmother his father will kill her, but the grandmother appears on the grave, so the grandson must carry out the "will of All√°h". The boy doesn't have the nerve, but to marry her and she gets the carper stitched and the money. On the night of her escape the grandmother appears again in a vision, she can go free, because we all die. The grandmother and the boy are the spirits of two great lovers from olden times. During the final scene they embrace and turn into a statue. There is a lot going on in those 90min. Not a 10 for a reason, but not an average 7 either......prolly a solid 8.5. I really like it. Perhaps because i was so impressed by Gatlif at the Cannes of last May with Transil
