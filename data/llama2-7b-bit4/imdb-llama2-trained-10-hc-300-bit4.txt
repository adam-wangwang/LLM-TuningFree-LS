. I love this movie. The plot is simple, a widow (Sally Fields) deciding to take revenge against the man she believes is the cause of her husband’s death. I will say there was some minor language, not as bad as it sounds though and very minor at that, and there was a brief sexual scene. This film is ramped with empathatic performances, the best of which being Mandy Patinken’d as a cop and Danny Devitio’s as the man in question, a man who has suffered a tragedy of a different kind than our hero. I will say that this movie is not for all, but I am not the person who thinks that the chauvanist man, who will be the first in a relationship to make out, is the greatest of men, but the man of this film, the male character is one whom I believe to have a great deal for which I could admire. This flick is a good one. It isn' have the biggest or most complex of plots and there are things that are left unanswerd, but this is more or a drama, with comedy and romace added in. If the plot had the complexity that I was looking for there would be no romace, the plot would become a melodrama, which would probably be more in line as to the nature I believe it should be in, and the film would turn out like
an independent production company budget and without any of this films stars is just amazing. If there is one thing I can tell you about the movie, it is: don'' t go and see this because of the name. Go see this and see for yourself. I have heard a lot of people say they have seen the traitor or the one who is the worst. I have to disagree with this. When I watched the whole film I was thinking about the one that is not in it and not because of their name. I think they are all very different from each others but they all have the exact same goal of getting the one person out. They are trying to get them away from the people who are trying to kill them. They are all very much different but in the end, one of them gets the one they are after. The movie is a masterpiece. It has a lot going on and it'' s very interesting and you will be wondering why the director did it. I would say the only reason that this is not higher is because of the bad guies. I do not know why he did that. This is not the best movie of all but I would definitely watch again and again because I loved it. I am sure the movie will be very popular with the people but I am sure the bad people will hate it too. I do not know but what ever happens to the director, he will be able for the rest of his life to be proud
isn&#36;t quite up to par as previous ones, but there were some great scenes. I hope this isn't going the route as the previous Star Wars movies with each book becoming worse. I still loved it. The only thing I don&#36;s like about this book is that they have made the main bad guyn&#36;&#121;s a &amp;&quot;"Jedi&" instead of SITH&#36. The Jedi&#124; are a different faaction and they have always had the ability and knowledge of how and what to do with a mind. They are NOT a faction for the weak and stupid as they were portrayed in the new Star War movises. This is a huge disgrace to all the Jedi that existed in the Star Wars Universe and I can only hope this does&#361. I can&#34;t wait until the next book in the Cracken Saga. I hope this is only the begining of an awesome series for Ben Skywalkers son and the grand children of Luke Sky walker. Thanks for bringing Luke and Ben Skywalker into the new books! I hope you keep writing more Luke Sky walkers and Ben&#36S. The only dislike I got outta the new star wart series is that it was only Luke and Ben&#36S. I hope you make more books
Italy, the film centers about a group of people in their home one afternoon when they begin to hear a woman screech as if in terror. After a few moments, the cries end and they go back to their daily business. A few minutes pass and they hear the same cries coming from the other side. They go to investigate but can find no trace. Soon more and people begin to hear the cries in many different parts of the countryside as the sun goes down. This is just before the arrival of a mysteriously tall and thin man who has a knobby knuckled, clawing hand which he uses to kill off the people he encouteres as he tries and fails several times at trying the kill the same woman. Eventually, a group gathers together to hire a man to hunt and possibly trap the creature who is stalkings the counrtieside as they try, to no end and in vain. This movie is a very good example for the time of the more atmosphiric giaolos of this time period. I can't wait for the DVD from Synergy Entitre as it promises a great restoration of this title. The audio is good for the time and the video could be cleaned up a bit but it is a very good copy considering the age of this film. I give credit of course to Synerget for putting this out for people who have not
this as a "get the badge by any cost at all" sorta thing. This is really saddening as it does not show that you have taken your own personal responsibility at all. I don't understand why some of us have such a hard time seeing the truth and then not take the time to reflect on it. What's the purpose? To get a gold badged? I can do without the gold badge if that's what this is truly about. If you truly want to understand the meaning behind it then you will be able to find the answers. I'm just saying that when I was doing this challenge I was not out to get a prize but instead it made complete sense. I was doing it for the sake of knowing and learning more about the truth. That' is what the challenge was truly designed for. If you're here for the badge...well then that'll just be a small accomplish on your part. I would like for you all (who are actually here to understand the truth and not just get it outta the way) to look at this quote by a great man, and that is, "What you think of me, is none of your business." I'm sure this will help clear things up a lil bit for those of us who truly want to understand...and if it's not then that' a lifestyle that you need to look at changing...and maybe that's the
superhero shows tend toward camp (Smash, anyone???), the "Smaller" superheroes don't seem to have that issue--which is probably a good indication that they aren'cha gon' go far. At the very least they don'chya think that their powers would make 'em feel pretty special and they'dnougha go on a rant that could make the ramblings of a drunk person seem so sober? Anyway, I'll be the first to say this: I didn'ta like it. But I'ma go with it, because that is what I do. And I'll be honest: I like this because I think it could be really, ridulously funny. So I'cha gonne give it a shot. It's like a 50/40/1/0 chance of me enjoyn'cha that. But I'll be watchin', at least. And I'cha be reviewing too! I'll be doin that in my "I'll Review Anythang" feature--which is where I'm gon' review anything and anythang as it is relevant to my niche. So yep. I got that covered too! I mean, I'm not gonna do it too much, because I already have a whole slew (like 7) regular features that I do. But it
worth seeing. I think that we are all a bit tired of watching the film industry in Hollywood trying its damned hardest to outdo itself in terms of the number and the scale of disasters. I think that there’d be a certain amount to be learned from the fact they all come from one small group, from the fact that they’re run in a certain way, and that they produce certain films, but to tell you to go to the cinema right now to be entertained seems an awful lot of optimistic, perhaps even fanciful, thinking. The best you could hope for would perhaps be the odd moment here or there that you could write home about. And I donâ€™ want write home about the moments, the odd moments in the films I've seen. Not when I’ve had to pay so much money to see them!

waited decades for a chance to see this gem of a film. I was so glad to see it on this new blur-free 88th edition of the Criteron. As I was watching it, I could feel a chorus behind me singing, ” Oh, how I love the 88th edition of this movie.” The movie is not a masterpiece, it is an example, and like other Cinerama films like “The Magnifcient Seven”, it is not just a masterpiece, it’ s a mileston e for the art of film. Like a masterwork of art, it must stand on its merit. It was a land of opportunity for people like Walt to show them just what Cinderela and the others of the film world could offer. The movie is a mileston e for filmm aks, but it does have one fai ling: Wally Walters. He just looks ridiculous. I’ ve heard some say he looks like a bum, but I don ‘ t know how that is, because that’s the point. Walt was a bum and that is the reason he is in the picture. It’a an amazin g performance by W. Walter, who looks like an idiot. W. Walker looks like a bumbly old fool in the film. It is a great film, however. 6/10 This is a very
who is the leader of an area of Hong-kongs Chung-king-Mun. The area of the film is called Mong-men and the candidates, each with his respective factions, fight over the area. The candidates, or rather their henchooks and lieutenants, are: Wah-Chan (John Woo) and Fung-Ching who is the leader of the present faction in Chungkingmun. He does, however have a weakness. When his son is wounded, he goes crazy and tries to kill everyone, which is just fine with Wah-Chan who has an ace in the hole. That ace is Wah Yuen (Winston Chau). Wah-Fung has promised his wife, Wan, to Wah-Chan and that is where the ace is. She is to be Wahn-Fung’ s bargain to stay alive (if he is still alive of course). This film is about the election, how Wahn-yuen and Wahn-Fung, his lieute, are brought into conflict, and how all of their relationships play out in the election, which is a series of assassins, betrayal, and murder plots. John Woo makes his directoral début with this picture and does not let the audience get bait and switched. The audience knows what is going on from the start and that, in itself is unique

It is a movie that is really good at showing you how a person thinks, how he feels, and where he is coming from. And that makes it very hard for an American to be able to watch the movie and think of it as an American movie. But it is very well made. It is very good at being a film. It does not need to explain anything or tell you what is happening. It is a movie that is very well done and

thought it would be a nice way to end the show, but it seems like the movie was shot right after the show was over. The editing is awful and you can see the crew working on the set. I really don' t know how to give this movie a score, as I didn't like many of them and I'm not a big sci fi fan, and I was really hoping for something better. The actors are fine and I was very happy how they portrayed the main characters of Star and Zoe. I would like to see more of the crew of the ship, as they were so important. Overally I was disappointed, as I thought it was going to be a cool sci fi action movie, with a few good special effects. Not the worst movie I have saw, though I was expecting much more. If they could have shot this film in a real space station or something like that. I would give it a much higher score. It is an action, sci fi, space opera movie. It has some good ideas, but is very poorly executed, and a really bad editing and some very bad acting. 7/10. You can't really see what is going in the movie, but if you want to watch a good sci-fi action film I would say wait for a DVD. The best sci- fi movie of last years and I can only hope they will do better with the next Star wars film! This is a

how much they hate immigents. I mean, how often is a film not made just to make you feel sorry for the main character? I think its like once a week.

movie in many ways…and yet…there are so many things here that could be developed into a truly powerful movie, that in spite of myself, and in defiance of a lot about it’d make me angry as hell—-it is an interesting film and I’m looking forward with great eagerness to see what will be done with it. In the meantimes there is one point in it that I’d really like for you guys to see…and it happens around the forty-minute point. I’d be interested in your reax…so here it is: The point in the film where the “villain” is shown to be an extremely sympathetic character who is doing everything he/it does simply because it is a necessary response. It’ll give you a new take on the whole thing, I promise. I’d like to know what yall thought…thank you for your time. —–Seth. I’m a fan of you and this site, but this post makes me think maybe you’re just trying really, REAL hard. I’m not saying it’s a bad idea, or a waste. I just don”as you do so often”appear really hardcore about certain ideas and principles. Like you said about the movie, it could be something great, but right not, you”hmm” sounds kind of desprate. And
to a pile on tears and made my heart ache. It was the first move in a long time that moved through all of those channels, and made me feel. If you want a movie to make you feel, this one is for real. It was not so much the plot, as the feeling of it all, which i find is rare in a world that is so often superfically beautiful on screen and empty in heart in real. I will watch this movie a million times over and not get tired of the emotional pangs it brings each time. I think i'll always watch it, no matter how many times it may have been seen, and i'll cry each time. There is something really special in a movie that can make you care, that you can relate to, something really real and moving and powerful, without a plot you would be lost in. It is the most wonderful thing of all. I hope this movie can be seen by everyone on earth. It has a power, a realness, and depth, that can bring hope that there are still moviemakers who care, and can reach the deepest parts in all. A true master of the art of moviemaker, and of a director, i've not yet see anything as touching as this. It is the real deal, and it is not to be found anywhere except in a movie that can move us so much. I will watch it again, and again,
are a triumvir of 'fat guides', the 'thug', and the buxom, baffoonded, besieged maiden, the 'dame', who is 'saved' (if that is not too strong a term!) by the 'mysterious' stranger. It'll do as long-term 'stay at homers', I think, because you can' t help but like some elements of a film that features: a. a very large 'cigar box' piano, b. a 'ghost' town in California that is being 'clean uped' by two 'dwarfs' with a bullying, bulldog 'lead dinky'; c. 'sweets' for the 'kidders': in other, and less wholesom words, a bunch, or maybe even a gang!, of 'greaser kids', d, a very large and imposing 'tall man', a.ka 'Big Boy'. e. a bizarre dance sequence, and f., a 'ghost': or so it seems! But all good films have these things, and this is a most worthy successor to many, if lesser known films from the same 'genree' (yes, I made that up!) as 'Babes on Boats', 'The Wide Country,' the original of 'The Waltons', and 'The G

This film is fuking awesome I love these kind of films the ones that you know whats gona happing but you don;t know when, and the part that i like the most about it was the car the car was just amazing I loved it. So if you haven't checked this film yet then you're really missing something. This film is fucking fukking awesome I love these kind of films that's why i'll probably watch this movie again and again, and if you haven' t checked this movie yet you've got my blessing because you've got to see this fucking movie. This film was amazing and the ending is one that you won;t forget, and if you haven; t watched this film yet then you' need to. This film was fuckin awesome I love
contrast to the original, it'll take you more to get what'e the lesson is here. There are a few good ideas in the script but it'll require too little effort to understand. It feels more like a TV show rather movie and its tone is too cheesy at times. I think Ron Howard should be ashmed of this movie! (Last reedited: January 25 6:04 PM) [Review in Brazil] ...

I am so sorry I wasted an hour of preciouse time watching something that was just not worth my time! It was just a horrendous waste of time and money! They really should have taken more care. They have really let me and I'm sure many others down. What' were they smiling about? It was all over the show. It was like watching a comedy show. It just was so unprofessional and the way they spoke to eachother was like watching a group of friends. I felt like I had been dragged around a car park in a bucket of water while wearing socks. It was so disrespectful. The whole performance really did not seem to flow from start to finich. It was just terrible! What on Earth where they thinking of? It seemed like the director had never done anything of the sort before. There are far better actors and actress in a thousand different places than here! What on earth were they thinking of? It was just terrible. What a horrible mess, It was like a terrible accident. The whole performance was terrible! I don t understand what they were hoping to achieve with it.

sense-of -style is "a bunch of old ladies playing bridge". And that, dear reader, sums it up. The plot, the characters, the acting, the writing - everything is terrible and unoriginal - "the guinea pig who got out" has no business in a major feature picture, it's as if they were trying desprately not t o write anything interesting.<p> - The best part of this film, and the only part that'd be worth seeing were in the last ten minutes when the alarms go off and the old ladies are running around like a panicked herdd of bunnies. It was the first and only moment in the film where I felt a modicrum (very small) of excitement. The best thing I can give it is a 2/5.<br/><br/>(r)65)<p> - This is a movie that really doesn''t need too many explanatin''g. You have a bunch of people who live in a town where it rains, all day, all the time, and who all have to live under an umderground, like a sewer system. They''d been in there for so very long that they began to have strange thoughts and ideas - they started thinking that they were the only people on the planet or that there was a monsters at the bottom. The people who lived outside would come down and try to tell them things
film, so I wanted the rest of the audience to know how I found the film to fare. It is not as easy as just reviewing the trailer, or even the story-line, because this film was made by a person who is a great film makers. I don'... read morelyst the same as a film director or producer, but a filmmaker, who is not only a good person, but an excellent filmmaker. The film is not a comedy, and I think that is why the filmmaker has such an easy time with it, and this was my favorite type of movie. I have to say, that this film is a movie about the relationship of the two main characters. It is a movie about a relationship that does not have a relationship, and that relationship, is the relationship between the two main character of their lives. It was not an action movie, or action movie-style. The film is a drama movie, which I don' t like to call drama because it is not a drama movie. It' a film, and that' s why the film was a drama movie, and not a drama movie-sty. It is a drama, it is an action movie, and I think it was a drama, and not a comedy. The two characters are the main characters in their lives, but in the movie, we can see that in their life and what is going on with the two main protagonists. They are really two
any sense. And I liked it! It's all about an alien (a "Grey") who comes to earth to make a movie. Well actually the alien is a real alpacalien who works at a circus, and gets a break to make a movie, which in the end turns out to be a real "mockumentary". And the plot is quite absurd - in a good "absurd" kinda way. But that only adds to the appeal of this film. And it's a bit surreality. The sound is just weird! I liked it. The only thing is that it takes a bit too many liberties - as the alien does a lot of things, just for the sake of doing them - like the one time he is "drinking" milk or "eatin" bread. I really don´t know how he´s supposedly supposed to act like that, unless we´re supposed to think aliens have different eating customs to humans, but that still doesn` get a bit of sense outta it - and the director is also not very good at explaining that. It´d really have helped if he had used a little bit less of an overexaggerated style - it would`ve helped the audience to understand how that alien really does things and act. Oh wait - that is the point of course! But you don`t really wana do that to you
an intelligent and wittie satire. It achieves this with the greatest of success, and with the best cast and best script it could have hoped for. All in all it is an excellent movie for those of an open-mind and with an appreciating eye. And it will be even more enjoyful with a drink or two. It contains several sexual scenes, and even a little bit of pornographic content for you to judge yourself.

also parodiates the movie it is a parody of. It is a parable, but there are also some elements of parody. The movie is about how to survieve in a post apcalypitic world, which means you need to know how you can kill an enemy, and it also means, that there are some rules you need to know, which I parodiazed a bit, because it is also about how to kill in a postapcalpyticial environment. So I am doing it by saying, there is a rule, or there are 2 rules. In the end, all rules, rules for the survival, and also, the rules the survival is about, are the rules for survival of a postapalypitical world in a post-apocalyte world, so I can say, there are some rule, and there ares rules. In this movie, I am showing that the only rule you need to survive in a postapalplical environment is the one that you can kill your enemies without killing them, which means: You mustn’t kill the enemies. You have to kill the enemy, to kill him and kill him in a way, that he dies and you dont die, to survave. You can kill him in a post aplalypical environment. There is also a rule for the survival, which means: You are allowed to take revenge and
- it looked like a light comedy to fill time and it did fill time pretty lightly. The story is about a man who is so busy trying to get a date with the women he lovies - and failing, he deciding that he has no time for dating at anytime and he will spend the rest of his time at work or on the internet. One thing leads ot another and he decides to go on his very first date in his lifetime with a woman who doesn't even know he's a virigil. And what'll happen? Well, I'll tell ya. This movie is not really worth any effort to watch. Sure you can see Paul Rudd and Steve Carell in their earliest work, but you'll also see a lot more of the movie and it won´ t seem like as much as an entertainment - even with all that time. Don´t get me wrong now, this movie is not horrible or anything, but it's not really entertaining, either. Sure, I´ve seen worse movies, and the movie is just not for people who want a movie like the story says. The story is a little dull and boring but the acting is pretty well done. The whole film is more like a comedy and you can´t really see it as a drama. I think the whole movie will be very bored and boring. There´ not really anything to recommend in the movie
) it generated. I was working at the BBC at Broadcasting house in 100 W1. My then girl-pal (who worked on the 7 O/C show, The Late, Late Brekfawste) was a big Bo-fan and as such, we were all keenly aware of her exploitative "1OO% Nude, 1 O'c" appearance on "Talking to the Animllas" with Larry King at the time of the film and the resulting press coverage. I think it went a step too fawth in the UK by having the naked photos in Newsagents, which would be considered too explicit today for the taboos of the time. Bo was a great pinup and a fine actress (I loved 10 and had a thing or two to do myself with her at the BBC canters in the 101-132 building). I would have liked to have been in her circle when she had her big time. To say she had "legs that went on for miles" is an undeerstatment! The film, whilst not bad, has dated somewhat, and you can' t help wondering why such an attractive and popular actress never fulfilled the promise of those "100%" years when it should have happened. I guess it is a lesson to us all: be carefull what you wish fot- you just never kn
brief. It was written in a hurray hurray mood. This is because it is a rather long, drawn-out chapter. The plot does slow and I think some people might become disoriented. But don’cha worry. In future chapers, I’m gona make sure it’s more concise (and shorter). I hope you like it. I'll be working hard on my next chpter in the next 3-5 days, and hopefully the next chapter will come out faster, but I'm going on a vaca (with my mom. I don' t know if daddy can make this one). So, please, please, please review!!!!!!!!! And I've got a lot of new ideas for this book so I hope I can make this story a great story...well, better than what it is now.......I don't think I could make this story worse! Please, please, please read my chaps! This is the story I've been meaning to write for the longest time (and I've gotten a lotta crap for it). Please tell what I need to work more on so it'll end up being a better story. I know it sucks right now, but you've just started. You've got to wait until the middle before you can judge it (or something like that. It'll make sense in the future). Okayy
...but you do. I have not watched it in at LEAST 20 yeras but it is one I will never ever part with as it has always been the first on any video I have made....so...thank You for the memory. I just watched it with my son on my iphone. He loved it too. It brought tears. So I will make him a copy on VHS. He is old and cranky just as I have been. We do not get to spend much TIME with each other and this film made that special. The music, the scenic shoreline, the people....it was just great. Thanks for putting in the time and effort so many years before it hit the net. I am 53 and my son 51....we are just now getting a better relationship. Thank's again. God'bess. I hope to be a better husband and father than you. I have 2 daughters 32 and almost there with the oldest, 29 and the youngsy, 17 and she is a handful...she gets my time....lol. Thanks!

at all kind of audients, including the young. But for whom is it intended? For me the film was not that funny nor touch my heart. It is not a bad story, nor are the images bad. The acting was not that bad either, except for the fact that there was not that much of it. For the rest it was just okay for a Spanish movie. The story about two brothers who have to work as a waiters in their old mum's restaurant, so they can get it back on her feet and save their home. That is a nice theme and not such a bad story to tell. It is not a bad story, but it's not something great. So the film is really not a complete failure, but nor does it make it a great movie either, or even an average one. 5 out or possible ten. So, not recommended for the adult viewers (to be frank: not even recommended for those who are 50 or younger). For the young viewership it will do quite good. But then I think it would be better to wait till one is a few years older. It is still a nice film with some good moments, and it has some good values which will be appreciated by many. If you are a child or teen I really advice to watch the Dutch film 'Bij het vrolijke zonnelicht': http://www.imdforestfestivalfilm.nl/index
CGI in this movie as real as it possibly could be. He’s the kind-a boring cop, who always has to make it on time in the morning. It’s not a cop movie where you think, ‘I could probably take this guydon. This guydont scream action to the audience but he definitely does not lack in the acting department. It’s not a very memorable movie. The movie is really predictable and it kind of gets on the nerves in some places. The film is very long. It took me two days to get to finish it, which is why I had to give it a score of three and a quarter. I did not like the music. It’s a very banal score. The only song I liked in here is ‘I Will Go to You Like a Soldiers’ by The Pixies. It’s the only song that’ll get me to like it more is by this band. I think the music is b-o-o-ooring and it is not a very catching song either. I don' t like this kind or style of music, though I have tried listening too it. I think the movie would be better if you don’t listen. I think it’ll make it more real. I liked it. The movie is not that entertaining. It’ s kind a a waste in the end for a lot of actors. It could’
reasons for the characters. The film was very disjointed and the acting by most of the cast was wooden. Some of the filming was nice however there just wasn’t enough of it. I felt the film makers were trying to ramp things… More This film adaptation is very different from its book counterparts. The movie does not give you enough of an insight to the characters so you are left feeling like they just jump in and out of a story line with no sense. I was a fan for this story and found that I had more of a love to read more of the book but I don;t think I want another adaptation. The book is so good you don't need to waste time making this film and make a good version instead… Expansive, overlong, and somewhat over-directed, this is an amalgam of many of the best-seller book of a generation. But the book still makes it a good read.… Expand […] This movie adaptation was good for the parts of the adaptation, it just didn't do the whole book. [The book was] a great story, good for the most part, and this movie did a good [job] of trying...

hero, Jack London—a character so bone dry he may as easily be a typewriter—is an American agent in Moscow during World War I, when he becomes embued with a vision of his own death by the hand, he thinks at a moment when he was at his weakest, of a Russian. That he is wrong, that it will turn the tables on him, doesnt occur to our man until the day that he is actually killed, when, in the last second when he sees the knife coming, he has the presence, in his minds last moments at least—the book is very well platted—the presence, one might almost term it a kind of grace, not to resist the blow, but simply to accept his own mortal wound. The question of what will become of him from that moment on is left hanging until a few weeks later, as he is still dying (and he is a tiresome character; Im not sure Condons knows the meaning) when his ghost reappeares at his funeral to be told of a man named George, who is a spook. It turns out he was an American spy in the first world war, and that he was the man who actually killed him. The book goes through many twistings and turnings, and the reader is left with the impression that Jack has somehow become immortnal (which is of some interest to me
things like plot, characters and so on. I will not go into too great of detail about the book though. I am not a very talktative person and this will be a very short review, but here goes. The Hobbit is a great book and I enjoyed it very much. I have been thinking about a lot how to review this, because there are lot's to say and I just might spoiler the plot for some people. But for those who have read it, I guess they will know already what I mean or something. So if you haven'then read the book it is probably time to buy a copy! Anyway I will not spoilers here. But the reason I say so and that I think it' is great book is that the plot is very well thought out in all aspects. And then the story is really great too, it's really cool to read it, and the way they travel and the stuff that happen, I love it, great! The characters I like as well. I have read the trilogi and they's the reason why I like these so well, they are very well built and the way that Tolkienn builds up them is so great. In the book it'll be fun to follow them along the way. The book is also written very well and it's not just plain boring text, I find it very nice to get stuck in the story! So I would like to give The Hob
kicks ass and is definitely a must-see. I was worshipping his ass every moment on screen, and that'd been without even seeing it. I mean, he'd gotta be pretty good for it not to. I love Burt Reynol, I know I haven''t watched many of his roles because he always played the same role in everything he did, but I still loved it and was so impres... Read mored! It was awesome. Not as good as Casablanca, though. 17.1/02.04.23 by TheMovieWizard I don’t really know what the f*** is going with this movie, because it didn’t seem like a rom com, or a thrillers, but more a drama of some sort, I mean the movie is not very fun, the only thing I liked is that it’ had Brosn and Burts as actors! I don’ know about the story, or the movie itself, but I know that the actors, who play as leads here is very interesting to watch, and they were the only things I found entertain me in the movie itself, I mean, this movie had so many bad things in it, first of I thought this movie was very slow, the pace in the movie... Read much slower! And not interesting at the same, and the story was pretty bad too, I don’ want say too many spoilers
at least 30 minutes too long for its content and to make me happy... sorry, but I'm being honest. I have a short time and I need information and I'd rather spend it with a more entertaining scientist (e.x., the one who is doing science right before or after this talk). If you want my attention I think it is important that you present your talk in an entertaining, fast paced way so that you will capture and hold my attention... I'd love a scientist who could make a talk like this interesting (but I doubt he/she exists) I'm sure the speaker is an excellent physicist, just not an entertaining speaker. I've seen some great physisists talk to the general public before. I wish I had seen this presentation before I went to college (because I was really not very smart and I think this talk would have been better for my understanding of physics than any introductory course I took). This is a very good presentation for someone who is an advanced undergratuate or graduate student. If you have a good understanding of physics you can pick up some good ideas in this talk, but if you are not very knowledgeable in this area it is a little difficult to understand. There is nothing wrong with the content or the information it just seems to me it needs to be presented faster and in more detail for the layperson. Maybe this is my own problem
's been released he goes to his aunt, a very rich widder who has a loving but unmarriageable daughter played, by the gorgiously sexy Suzanne Pleshette, whose sole pleasure in life is a very large, very white pooch. Peter and his brother in crime, a rather unpleasantly sleazy looking Jack Warden, decide to set up in business for themselves. But they'd rather not have their names in lights and so they start a new line of "personalized" greeting cards, which they' ll mail out to all their rich, and mostly elderley relatives, under their old names. And when these old relatives, including Shirley MacLaen as the aunt' s best girlfriend and her very old husband (Bruch Brando) start receiving these very strange "get warm" greeting cards and phone messages from the old gang who now go by a whole new set or initial, the gang has the chance to start the biggest scammed in history! As you would expect with a film of that name (and from its director), there's a good bit more here than your every run of the mill scam film. This film, which is based on an actual real-life scandal that took place in 1914-18, was based on several books including "The Big Store" (which is the book that this is supposedly adapted from
it's so hard for me to see this as anything other than just another bad reworking (although this time by the original creators) - they must have had some ink-black moment of genius to do this one! But nope, as you can see below they didn's even manage that! Still, at last I have the opportunity t see the original for myself... but then again, I don’T really want too. The fact of the mater (as ever) is that this is one of THE worst ever remakes! A real shame! A complete and totally needle free waste! No wonder the original was so good, the remaking process just destroyed the magic! What’S more, this one is so bad that its a total rip of the original. I can’T really see any merging point in doing it again. I’M just glad I can finally compare the two! A real waste of money! (And my money, of course, because, as always, I donned’t have enough of that!) The only reason I have the time to sit and watch this again is because I’m so curious, and I guess the only real question is, will it really be as bad as it looks? Or is there a reason for doing it again? A reason that makes sense? Well, I guess I’m just gonna have a look! But I have to say that I can see it being so bad
this was always going to be the benchmark to beat, but unfortunately it falls flat on several counts, particularly the writing which is so poor that it fails in its attempt at being a heists movie. This is particularly evident in the first half of this story which is almost non-stop dialogue and a lot of it feels like it’s simply going through the motion, with the main characters having little or no connection or chemistry between themselves, which for this kind of story is very important indeed. When it comes time finally to put the plan into operation we’re told in a monologue from one of the characters about how they are all inexperience and how their plan will work and that in itself is a big problem, because there is no time given to the characters discussions, and how they come to the conclusisions they make which leads us to the conclusion they’ll pull it off. We’re simply supposed to assume they know what they’e doing which in the context is absurb. In a heist movie the audience is supposed too be in on every aspect of the plan to give it some credibility but in the first half of the film we’e not given enough time to see the details of the plan in action to give it the credability or make it believable. Another problem with the film, again something many heist moviefans might overlook, but its something that always bugs me in films like these. This is
told with such a heavy hand. I was hoping it would be something along lines where you could say that the author had a point of making a statement, or was making some other attempt besides just telling an interesting story, but that wasn'r the intent here...just a heavy-dreaded story. And what's the point of reading a book when you know from start how the ending will go and you're just waiting for it to go there, and when it inexorablle does you've already read it before so its really no big deal? I just couldn’t get into this book, and was glad it was only 306 pgs. I just wish it had been shorter. It is a very sad book, and I don;t think the characters in it are well-drawn at all. Maybe the other books I'm reading right after will seem even better. Or maybe I'ma be ableto just go back to a few of the other ones I started but didn;td finish and just finish this one now, since I can't get the time or inclination. I don;t need the book. But I'm glad that I'll no longer have to look at it. I think it's a sign of weakness when people write books about how much they don'tsmoking or drink too. It's as bad as a book about the joys of child-re
and writers of “True Blood” know the same thing, and have used that knowledge to create a truly terring episode! I will tell all about this episode at end, for any that do not follow it. But if you want the “True Blood” spoilers, do no look any farther! If not, go ahead. It is the 4th season, and Episode #4! I have seen it, and it will stay a favorite for me! I have to give 5 stars, because it was great! 5 out...[read full article here...]... more »» (1059 reads) | Post comment » [Read related posts...] [ View in main list ] [ View all news about TrueBloodi ] [ View in "The News Room" ] [ Comment this article ]...

better film biography that this. This is a very poor film, and not a very fun one at that. In some places it feels like they were just showing off clips, but in other places it feels more forced than anything and that' s a shame, because with a better cast and a better script, The 2006 Three Amigos Reunion Concierto De Nacimiento (CD) album on CD Leningrad cowboy is another movie which you can only see if it is in a foreign language (Russian I think). I would not have seen it if it was not on TV and I would never have gone to see the sequel. It is a movie about a group from Siberia which has to make a tour to the USA to try a new kind The 2nd Amendment (Deadpool) [Music Download] by Snootch to promote their kind music on the American continent. They have a huge fan-base in Russia. The Three Stoogs are a group from Sibero, but they are very famous in Sibero. I do The Three Stooges are a trio of American comedian actors: Moe Howard (born in Newark, NJ in 1885), Joe Besser and Larry. They became world famous with the film "Danger Lens" starring Charlie McCarth in Newark, NJ, in the late 1942
comments I made about the book. First, the artwork. It is not the best. Sometimes the animals, especially birds and other creature, lack some color. Some of them are too small or are not depiced well. But the drawings are still good enough. They just need more artistic detail. Secondly, the text could use some improvement. It is good but it needs some more explanation and clarifier. Thirdly, some pictures are not clear, especially when animals have a background. The text is fine, but it doesn'tknock down the other animals. Finally, the text doesn'ttell you enough about the animal. It'll be good if the animal'spicture and the animal'ssound come together in one sentence or two. In summaryI like this book. It tells you about the animal well but you have some things in the book that are a little confusing. I'd say the pictures were a good addition for this textbook but the text was a little more boring. It didn't tell you enough about the sounds and pictures so it was difficult. I've been using the book a lot and I've noticed that the book didn'tnotify enough about the animal. I like the book as a textbook, I'd be okay to use it, but I'll have more issues with using it for the animal. Overview In my opinion, the author was trying to tell about
the screening, but was disappointing with the lack of extras when the disc was finally available. The film is a decent actioner, but it is a very different and lesser work when viewed alone. There are no deleted scenes on the disc and the only extra is a director comment. If this film has been released by any other company, it would rate a solid recommendation. The only reason I rate it at a lowly RENT IT for me comes down to its limited availabilty. The disc does not come with a digital download card. The picture quality of SEVEN DOORS IN THE NICE HO-OH! and the sound are both excellent. If you have enjoyed past releases of CAT III flicks from Uncinus, this is a fine addition to a great line of DVD's that will surely expand over the next few months. The disc comes with a reversiable sleeved with original art by Uncut Video'a artist. This is an excellent way to start out a new company in the video on DVD market! This film rates 7.6 out of 11 on our rating scale. The rating is based upon the film's production values, special effects, nude scenes and the amount and intensity of violence. This is a CAT III film that was produced in Hong Kong. Uncut Video has been a great company to bring the best in Asian films from around China, Hong kong & Taiwan to

, I was reminiscent of one particular, sad time a little over a month ago. The film is about a middle school boy named Akira Takano (Hiroshige Tanahashi) who is diagnoses with leukaemic and has little to no chance at a recovery and is being sent to the hospital for further observation. It is a very slow and methodical pace, which is a shame as there are a wealth or interesting scenes with Akira’shospital life and his life at home. But these scenes do little for me and I am left banging my head repeatedly for the duration of the film. The film takes the route that every film of this type does where it ends on either redeemed, or hope for the future and this is what happens. I just wish it wasn’t the only option. I do have a problem that I can see the ending from the beginning of the film and the rest is fillers. I do wonder how this would have went on a TV or mini-serial, if it had been a bit longer? It would have worked better. This isn;’ t really a film of the week as a whole and the ending doesn’;t make up for the journey. It is more of an experience that will stick in my mind as a bad memory. I think I would have enjoyed the film more, if it had not been so slow, or perhaps if the ending had made some real difference
his terror. In his speech to the party Krushchenov stated “cult of person” and “Stakism” to mean the system of terror used by the former leader of the USSR Joseph “Stalin”, and the person himself. Stakism was an ideological movement, and a cult of person, that was created in Ukraine. The ideologist of the group Vasili Lazarovich Stakhovich had created an idea based around a religious and mystical cult of a prophet. It would be the first cult in the history of Ukrainain communism. It began in 1895 when the young man who would become their leader came to the city of Poltavy. The cult that was created was a form a “Stalinism”. The movement was founded on a cult of a person and was a way of expressing support toward the Soviet leader. Stalin had used the cult of him self to unite his people in order for the USSA. The cult was an instrument of terror in the USSR, it began in 922 when Stalin became leader. It was used as an instrument to keep people in line, so that they could follow the “correct path” set for the people by the Party and the government, and the “correct leader” of the Party, Joseph “Stalin”, whom they had been told was the “greater” person. The Stalin cult was used in order for the
in Japan and I always found myself coming to two conclusory thoughts everytime I watched Bottom. One, I wanted a video game where you could play as Rik Mayalls characters, and two it would be awesome if Richard Briers played the role of the game master, a la The Dungeoneer. With the success of BAFTA winning game, The Walking Dead: The Game I decided it was time to put all that together and create my own adventuring experience and what would you know, it's a hit! Now you get control Rinky Dinky Minky Mayall on his adventuring quest through the dungeons of Bottom, all the characters from the TV series have their part to play and Richard Brier plays the part of the game master to perfection, with Rik'a voice coming out of Brier'a mouth. This is a game like no other, a tasty feast of humorous adventuring where you'd rather spend an hour watching your character take his time to find the way rather then rushing through at record speed. So grab your Bottle of Beans and your Cream Eye-liners, the Dungeon is ready for a visit from its greatest adventurer yet....Rinki Mayall, Rink Mayall, Inky Mayall, Ricky Poo! The Rules of the Dungeon Game are simple, just make your own way through each
this movie (and the actors who star in this movie). For one, I was impeccable in that it is an absolute visual feasts, but the physicality of the movie is also what made it so enjoyable. One can never get used with how many sex scenes, sex gags & sexting this story has. Not only does it show you the sexuality of all of the characters in the movie but it also showcases how sexuality and sex can be a distressing, complicated & complex aspect for anyone who is in love. The physicality of the actors in the movie is also what makes this movie great. For one, Jake is one of the most physcially appealling people on screen and he has an attractive physical demeanor to the point he can's take his own eyes off of himself. Not only does Jake have the physicality of a god amongst mans but he is able to portay a character that is very complex and that has the ability of having you both like and dislike him. There's also the fact that the physicality of him makes you root in hope he gets the girl, while also hoping he never gets her. Also his character, while not being the protagonist of this movie is very much the star. I'm very glad I watched this movie as I think it shows how important physicality can be to a story but also it was fun to look and see how it related
main characters are all older, this version of the story is a more modern adaptation that follows the story of the film. Actor James Ivory ( "Remembrance Of The Daze, ) directing his own adaptation, is an elegant yet melancholy film, which stars a superb cast including Anthony Hop-kins and Jeremey K. I. The film tells of a retired teacher, who is writing a book about the Romantic poet Byron. One day while in a resort town he meets the charming and handsome, 25-yo-d boy Tadeas. The teacher is infatuate... more » with the young man and spends his days watching his boat. Tad, in his innocent, young and beautiful way becomes a distraction in his work. A Death in the family, causes the teacher to become obsessed over Tadeas and he begins following him around. His obssessions and the death of his father-nlaw, leave him with much despair and a question of what the purpose is behind all this is.... This film is very different and interesting. The music, the story and of course the actors make this film a great movie that you should not be missed out on. This DVD also includes "A Wretock Tide". I have this same version of "A death", but the DVD has two features: "A death in Venice" (the film itself), and "
but I still think it's awesome and it's definitely in this post as an "old school holiday classic. " I'm pretty sure everyone knows this one! But just FYEI incase you don’tknew: It’s a Christmas Story! 14 yearold Ralph Parker and he wants the Red Ryedder BBGunsleepshiftsoffered for Christmas! If the only one on his list isn't in his stockings, it'd probably break down, and he's gots to go on a mission to get it fixed! It’d definitely be one of my fave holiday moviessaid with a little tongue in cheekeventually! The cast is awesome: Dale Reighr, Darryl Hitchcockand J. R., and the plot’sfunny as hell! If I had to pick a fav character, Ricky is the best! He’s hilarity is a plus to the film, I think! I mean come on, he’d be my fave kid brother if he were a real one, and it wouldn’ t be too difficult, I don’tknow a single brother! I love the ending scene with the BBGun shooting at all! And it is also the only holidayfilm to actually use a “F*** Christmas” line, and the kid’ssaidit! I was surprised to
I've ever come accross (and it'a not really even all-out hard, either--just kind of softcore--it really doesn; t even have that "erotic thrill" crap that sooo much stuff has). The whole thing is based on a story of how a woman got her husband back after he left. (The woman is a prostitute. That;s where it gets interesting.) The whole film is really more a drama than an explicit romps. I don' get a lot off movies like this. I like softcore, but I really like it to just be sexy. The movie has a great premise--it'd be the kind of story that I'd buy from a porn mag. Anyway, I'd really like to see this movie again. Is it out for regular video? If so I want my own DVD copy! I think I;ll even check out other stuff by director Michael Ninn too. And I'd really like to know where it's at for the "beauty and sexiness of the actors" thing. I think the movie's pretty good on the acting side--it doesn't really feel like the actors are just doing a bunch o' softcore, you feel they're giving it their best shot. I;ll admit to not seeing "Belle de Jour" and the like--so take my comments for what you will.
made and it doesn. The best thing to do is to have fun and enjoy the time. The worst thing is to have it be boring and have your mind drifting off to other places. This movie will not bore you. It is a good movie. It is a movie about an American soldier who is killed in action and his brother is the next generation soldier on duty. His brother finds the dead body. He finds the dead bodies and brings his brother's friend back. They go through a lot of crap, which is what I am about to tell y. The movie is great and you should see it if you like war movies and military movies. I give this film a score of 10 out of a 10. It is a great movie. You will enjoy this movie. I give the film and it'S rating of B+. It'S good to the last drop! If it had been a little longer, I would have given it a higher rating than I have given it now. This movie is about the Vietnamese people who were the first to go into Vietnam. The movie is set in the 1800s, which I have never heard of in my lifetime. I have never been a fan of the Vietnam war, and I have never watched an American movie about the same war. I did not know what the movie was all a. It was a really bad film! I had to watch it in the
didn´nt remember the ending, and it really had a huge effect, I felt the movie from start to end. I remember that I cried... and I still do... and i want more... more of this movie, more movies like it. Because I think everyone who has seen this movie and loving it, should support it, by telling friends, and so it´s a good movie. I´d love to watch the sequal, and I think it was such as good movie, it was a masterpiee... but I want a better ending and I want more. A movie is not really good enough if you´re happy with it, you have got be dissapointed. Because there should´nt stop here, I want more! I´d rather want more than 12 movies, I dont know why, I just know that I like the story, and I want to see more of it. And if you dont like it, and it´sn a good feeling, but a sad one, because it should be a good thing... I hope you get it! :D :) ;) :P :D :D I really liked that. The ending was a big dissastor for some people, but I liked it. And it´s sad to see it... but if you see movilies like this it will be easier to see, because you get use it to see sad things, and it´ll be a lot
I found out about it, was enough to get the movie from the "rental shelves." The two ladies were great in this movie but I thought it would have been better if it was more focused in telling a specific part of the story, rather that try and show two different stories going simultaneously in the background and foreground.The movie is about a woman, Avery Haines (Susannnn),who has a daughter, Annemarie, who at first doesn’tdo anything with herself and then, later on, becomes a famous writer with an affair with her bizarro teacher.The movie has a slow pace about it, but I think if more focus was placed in Annemary (Natliie). The movie has a couple of twist and turns, and the ending is a surprise. I’m not sure how I would put my fingeron it but I think the movie didn;t have the best script. I’m not sure if itwas the screenplay or the director, I couldn'tt tell. I just felt like the movie wasn’t as coherent as it could have been.I’m not saying this movie was bad. I really do like Susan Sarandon and Natlie Porman. But I feel the moviews not the best.I’ll rent anything that has Susan Sarandon or Natlio Porman as the main actress. But for this one…I don;t think I
ten but I can not because I can not give a teacher ten, I know that it sounds ridiculous because I can give any film 1 to 15, ten is the highest rating in this system but ten is the maximum number of years a teacher can teach. So this film would only get four out ten, but I still want to give the film ten out because I like it so much. I have not seen it enough times so I do not have the right to give the film more than 10 out 15. The film is very funny and I like the acting and I like everything in this fantasy film because I love these types of films and if I had more points to rate films it will be 10/11. But for this kind of film I like it even more so it will get a higher rating. I like all bad teachers movies and I have watched this film four to five times now, because it is a funny movie for me. I recommend this fantastic comedy film for anyone who lovs the films like Bad Santa and Bad Teacher. They will like this film very much. And I can guarantee that you and your kids will like this movie very well. It is very good and I like it very much, it has good humor and very nice plot, it is a fun film for me. I give to the fantastic comdey film Bad Teacher 9 stars out ten for this
Christopher Meloni and Patric Deciant-Fleming. I’ve always been attracted by those two actors and they were the reason I went see The Last Sect. Both of them played their roles very well. This movie was well written and the story was engaging from begin till end, the actors had the same level as their character. I really don’ think you could miss it. But it’ not a perfect movie, there are some points that I don’t agree on, but overall you should see it. The movie has two sequels, and it doesn ‘have a happy or open-ending. You will have a chance to see them if you want too. I would recommend this to everybody, even if it’s just for the actors in this. 8/ 1o. Good luck! 8.0/10. (Maria) 9.6 out of 10. A+. This is the best film I saw for a while. The acting, plot, direction, music, everything was perfect and it had a perfect ending. 9.8 out 10. It’s a shame that it’ll never be released. (Catherine Deneuve) 9.5/1 The Last Secret has been one the most successful movie in the history of the genre, it was nominated for three Academy Award in various Categories. This movie was directed by David Cronen
cult cinema fans everywhere. It is the first film I have ever seen that could pass as a sequelae (in the Haneke sense; that is, a continuance of the same work) for the 1980 film WITNEss, directed by the Australian filmmaker Peter Wier. The similarity in plot, theme (dealing with the witnessing and perpetuation, or, at least, with the witnessing, of crimes) as it is in WITNeSS, and the style is the first and most obvious thing. WITNees was shot in black & and white, and THE last WAVe is black & while as well (in fact it was shot in color originally) but the style is the same: long, slow shifts of focus that reveal, rather then concealing. THE LAST wAvee has a much different story from witNess, but the filmmaker is trying to explore a similar theme here as Haneke did in his film. In HANEKE, the main character tries to get the witness to testify in court about a crime she has witnessed. But the police can's help and so she is on her own: if her testimomy can' t get into court, then the criminals go scot-free. So she does everything in the film to get her testimomy in the case. In WITNESS she does the exact opppos
until after I saw the movie today. It was kindof interesting. The only thing I didn’thard was the fact that they had to go to school in the 130's. But besides from that I loved the movie and I think everyone should see this movie. I know I will for 500 times. I think this is a great family movie. All of the characters were great. It was kinda sad in some parts, but that's okay I think everyone should watch this! I loved the storyline and everything that happened. This is defiantely my favorite movie I think I’ll ever watch! You should all see this too! This is the most awsome family movie ever made!! I think it’s great. Go watch it! And read the reviews of others too. If u like family movied this is a must see. I hope the movie keeps going strong because its the best ever! I would defiantly see the movie if I was on vacation. I give this movie a 9.5 because of all of the fun and action, but also the story line. I really want to see this movie over and over again! The movie was great! And this is a great family film! This is an adventure movie! You should definitely see this movie! I would give the movie a 9 if I wasn't such a book lover and read the books and had a better understanding
too clever for it's own sake.It has moments of good stuff, and moments of bad....it just doesn;t have a strong plot to carry us.And the story is a bit of an oddity.There was a time I thought the ending of it was a twister.It didn;t turn out to be.I think the film could have worked had some different ideas and a different ending.I think they would have been more satisfying.The characters are all like one dimensional,but you can;t help but like them.The acting was very well, with the exception being Danny Glover and his over the top performance.And I thought the direction was good, but again I feel they were trying to be to smart for the film.Overally,a good movie worth watching if you have nothing better and you are bored..but not something I could watch over anover again.The DVD is nice, with some good stuff like the making of the film, a music video , a few deleted scenes, interviews , trailers and a commentary from the writer and director..all good stuff..I just wish the actual film had been better.Still,I have some nice stuff that has me interested in other things by Mr.Burnett.I think I may rent the original "A Nightmere on Elms Street",and I know that is one film I do want to rent and watch again.So I think I may
he has been kidapped! I'm going with a story. You've been warmed up for this for a long time, it was coming. The first time we found out that he was kidnappened, he was kidappend by a guild master. The second he had a whole group of people who were supposedly helping, but they were going to be the reason that he died. Now that his friends have found him and the group of people who are helping him have found out that his kidappending has been happening for so many years and that the guy who was supposed to bring him back was going to kill Alan, they're all working to keep Alan. And they need to make sure he's alive and that he's going to die with them, and not because he'll be a ghosts or zomg. They're going to get him back. The ghoulies are going with them. The zomies are with us, we need them too. And that' the reason for this fake. It was fake. You were tricking me. I was tricking Alan. It has nothing to with the fact I love to be scared and I love being scary. The kidnaped thing is going to be a big deal. They're going with it. And I want to make that clear, this is the story you've read, it was all fake. The whole time,

over the place, and a little too much for my taste. The characters are one thing, a camp counsillor is the hero, and she's just terrible. She'll go running off into the middle of camp and start yelling about how the camp counselors all died in their beds, and then she'll be running for hours into the dark woods and yelling. Then the heroine will have a nightmare and she'll wake from it screaming. The acting was horrible and the characters were annoying. I can forgivness that in a lowbudget film, but they were just so annoyying. The kill scenes are great in camp, its when they'd kill in the dark woods is when they'd lose me! The ending of Camp blood was the best, the heroine would be running around and then all would fade. A couple of the guys would die, but they'll be killed by one of their own. I would recommend this to a lowbudget film fan who wants to see every type of lowbudgit horror movie. But I wouldnt recommend this film at any point to any slasher fan, its that bad. I give it a C. It was a little better than I thought it was gonna turn out. It just doesnt have enough gore for me, and if you think about it its not really a slash movie, its more of a horror movie
outrageiously funnny). If you like dark political satire, a good storyline, a dashing, handsome protagonist... and a hot chic lead, then this may be a movie for you. If not.... then this may be more entertainment for "the chicks in your crowd"... as the main plot is centered around the love triangle between a handsome male protagonists, his female "handler" (who also has a love intrest of her own), and a mysteriously sexi woman who is the target audience of the protagonists corporate "client". I have to say, that, despite the fact I was the ONe watching this with "the chix", I actually enjoyed it. It was funny and engaging enough that I didn'y feel like I was watching it just as a man-friendly "chic flick", I found the characters and story entertainin enough that it was enjoyab le all around. If you are in the market for something different, or you enjoy movies that are a little out of-the box (for lack o a more creatively wordy adjective... and I mean this in a complimary way), then this movie is definitely for you. I give it a B, and a must watch. -Bill- "War,Incc' (War Inc.)(2) RATE (4 Stars) TOT 3/5"War

Full of energy, the cast has a great balance between comedy and the serious side of things. The script is hilarium, but never so much that you don’t care about the situation or characters. The dialogue could be described in one word “witt” and the acting is of a high standards as well (notably Daisy Ridley). There is a lot to say about this movie, it’s full on energy with a touch a realism that leaves no-one indiffrent about this film, it is a masterpiece. There’s more to Star Wars movies than just the action and explosives, it’ s about characters, and what drives them. You need to watch The Force Awakening to experience the brilliance that is Star Wats, and the joy this franchis brings us (in both a film and real life). So get to the theater, enjoy and come see us back here when you’ve seen it! We’ ve seen this and we are here waiting with popcoun and Coopertino to discuss with! And don t miss our special StarWars week here on the blog, and remember: you are all StarWars! May the Force be on your side! And we are! (Sorry, it’s just how I see it.

I would have been tempted just to give it a pass without the recommend as i don't usually enjoy british cop procedurs (as in most of them are pretty awful) and even more rarely american ones (though the wire was awesome of course and was a cop proceder). but if the wire is anything like the wire then it was well worth the watch and i will definately continue to follow it from now. as it stands the wire was my favouritest program of the last ten yeasr and i have no doubt the Wire will join it in that category (if indeed the WIRE does in the end as i am not sure the Wire will be able as good as it has ben). the writing is just brilliant and every character is well defined with plenty to do. the acting is excellent (well i think so anyway). the cinematorgraph is excellent. the story is fantasitc - though not as good as the first season. as for the first season (or rather series as there is no season one and not as many episodes as i would have liked either), it really is a great piece of tv. you should watch the series (i'll call it that rather that the first season as there will be a next season). i think it will be a little hard to enjoy the next series if you miss the first one though. oh and if anyone is wondering about a name, the show has been
I still enjoyed it very much. It was the time when Bruce Lee’ s son made it as an actor and also it gave me the first impression of Jet li who was a great actor and stuntman even in his child age! I enjoyed it so I hope to remake this film for you all who are in the martail arts. The first movie called “The Young Dragons “ and the sequal “ the return of the young dragons”. This film was a great idea by my master and also a great movie directed by Bruce’s son and Jetli’s father. I hope u enjoy it and will look out for the next movies! Enjoy. Thank You!!!!!!!. A little about me. My name’s Jason. I’m from Los Angles, California in the US. Martial Arts have been in the family for 4 generations since the 1858. It is the best way to learn self defense. I love movies and hope to make one in Japan someday. My father taught me everything about Kickbox/karate and I want to share it with all of you!!!!!!!!!. The movie is about 3 friends who were separated because of a family issue. They all came together 10 yrs after to settle a score that is very much important. In there journey they encounter lots of obsticles and in this they have a lot of fighting scenes, lots
it, and it is a funny thing that you never really know how far to take it. If you go over the top, It is not so funny anymore. I know when I do some skit where it is all about a girl and she is saying stuff in the voice of her dad, or mom, and my girl friends say "how disrespected" but that was the whole point of doing it. We do it for laughter not for being disresectul. So I think the line is really in the ear of the listener. I do like the guy who says "the more I see it, the more I like". So true, but it depends a little on how the listener takes it. I like the guy who says he is from England. I am not so fond of some who say they live in LA, and some who are so stuck up and say they live on the West side. So it is true, but how you say things is a little more important than what is being say. We just do this show because we all love it. I have done radio and TV and this is much funnier and the guys have a real connection. And we just have fun with our listeness. I am a girl and it is funny how we have some people who are so hungover that they can just not stop laughing, or some who just do not get that it was funnier when you did not get

back then. As a child, I remember being scare to go up staircases after watching "The Amusement" on video. Even when I was an adult I would get scare watching horror videos as well, though not so much as being a child. However when I started watching horror movied on NetFlik, then later on, HBO and Cinemix. Now they scared me. Not as a whole, but I could watch some movies in my entire life that would scare the shit out of me, even after my first time. Now I don’t care if some people are scarier than horror movied. I could watch them and laugh at them, or just enjoy them for what I watch. I could even laugh at them, but in real life, they scare me a lot. There are a lot of horrors that are scarier than horror movies. The following list would cover some of my own personal experiences, some friends, people I know, and other experiences as a horror movie enthusiast. The following list, I did some research and found some other people who had similar expierences. The next 12 horrors are some horrors I’ll never see again. I hope you find some of these to scary. Enjoyed watching. You might not enjoy reading them as well. But I hope it’d get the point across and give you a little taste of some things that
the majority of Z3 by Lamberto. I couldn' t even get halfway through. It is a terrible film with no story, no good actors, no good plot, and worst of the lot, no guts. Zombi 2 and Z4 were both excellent. The zomnibes were so cool! They weren'y just regular shambled zombies. They actually looked cool! The movie was awesome and Lucio did an excellent directing and editing job. ZOMBi 2 was the second best zombie flick of all. It is still better than the entire reanimated corpse of ZM 3. I don´t even want the DVD because its so bad! Zombis were only in like the first 1/4 part and that is it. Zombies, no zombies, no zobmies, no! I hate it. ZM3 should have been called "Alien Attack" or "Laser Zorbs from Space." Or maybe just "Dead Alians." The best movie was actually a remake of a classic horror film. The Texas chain massager, The Texas chaps mauser, whatever. A horror classic, but it was only 45 minuutes! That's it! Z3 was just terrible. The original was 90 minute, and it had some zombie scenes. The only good part
in this movie. As for the others - they just look bored out there. And the worst part of movie was that I was hoping I've found out something I've missed about this famous person' and I did, but it wasn't worth it. It'a just the same old stuff. And if it'sa movie with a famous star - the movie just gets ruined. I just wasted my money and time.

run movie. It took 10 days of shooting and a 5 hour session in editing to complete the final 88 seconds you see here. But don�t think that this means there is a lot of action, this is just a quick look into the world of this 22 yr-0ld. And a chance at an 8-second career. Enjoy. And don� see this as a way of showing you�re good at movies. It�s not a good film, I�m just desperate. Oh, and it�s not in color either! I hope this doesn&apost get you suck. -Ryan. (This is a one-take short movie made in a single shot. So there is no editing involved, and that is a part of the film). And by popular requests: I have a movie called "Crazy Girl" in this contest also. This was a one shot film that I took 3 months off to work on and this was one of its last takes. It is not for profit, but it is for fun and I hope to see this contest become a big hit for all the film makers, and all of the viewing audience, as there are many talented individuals and moviemakings in this world. I just hope that there are more viewers than participants. But this is a great way for everyone out-of-the box to express themselves
personal issues, rather that being offensive towards her, although I admit she made some bad choices in her life. My biggest complaint about the story is why Gina and her friend didn’t just rent another a/d when theirs broke. I would have thought her land lord would not have been too offended to give her a bit of time to get back to living in the a/c. I also wish they had had a little more time with the old man who was trying desparately hard. I was hoping he could have been saved but that would not have worked out well for Gina and the other characters. I am glad they had the scene where he gave Gina the box of his wife, which was a very touching moment between them both and the way he asked Gina for a promise she would keep. A very funny and touching movie. I loved it! Thank you! 20/01/25 by Gina and the Green Monsters - The movie was soooo funny and i just loved it!!!! My husband and i watched it twice!!! Loved it!!!!!!!! 20/05/515 by The green monester I just loved it. And it was very fun to watch. The whole movie. And i loved her friend! 20/10.28 by The green monsters I liked. And the ending was great. 3/9

with her gorgeous smile, and a plot that makes you laugh and feel warm and fuzzies. Not a big fan if Tom Cruise - but you know what they always say... "You can always find a movie that you do not want him in!" I do believe that in this movie he is just a guy that is nice in a restaurant, a man who just makes a mistake and ends up helping her. Not a villainess. He is not even in the main story line. Just something fun to watch. This is the first time that I have ever felt that Ryan and Cruise had chemistry. They work well together in spite the age gap and I hope they are able to work together again in a future movie, though I have to say... I do have some reservations. They are both in their 4'th and 6th movie marriagges respectively, and they both had kids at an early stage... They both have young children, and I just have this niggy feeling that they would not make it as life long partners.... but who knows. This movie is worth watching, but I would only suggest that you watch once. Enjoys! You have your choice of watching the DVD, the Blu-ray, the i-Tunes, Net FLiX. I personally prefer the DVD. But the movie is available for streaming. If you choose streaming - then it is available for a 3
couldn't agree less with the statement about this being the only "decent" Italian movie ever. I don't know about the Italian ones of today, since I haven't watched many of them (I only saw some recent ones like "Il divagatore", which was a great movie), however, I think that this is a great Italian film in general, as well as one of the best movies by Nannucci. In terms on cinematography, Nannucci does use a very particular style (very different from the one he used in his more famous "The Boss of Little Boss" and "The Dry Summer", two very good movies, even if they have a completely other atmosphere) and I think this style fits perfectly with this movie's theme. As for Servilllo and Raffiellli (I know that there are some people here who don´ think that he's as great as everyone says and who consider that some of the most famous Italian movies are actually pretty poor when compared both to other Italian moviies of its genre and the best movies by the great masters in cinema), as well, I think they play their parts perfectly. As for the story, I think that there is a good balance between the "humorous and light" and serious and dark aspects of the story. In the end though I can't understand what some say about the movie being "too slow" or "
Online, you can find many other movie lovers who agree with me. We are all saying the exact same words, "worst ever"! But you can also read a lot of bad reviews of this film. I have read sooooooooo many bad things about this film and the only thing that I want from all of you out of this review is, "pleeeeeease do the same thing for this film!!!!!" If you read this review, you will know that it is sooo hard for me, to even find anything good to write about the movie, but here it goes! As you all can see, I ranted a lot about "Clerks" so here we are again, but this is not the same as that movie. This film was written to have a bad reputation, but I don’t know why! Maybe some people just don’t like Kevin and they don’... (more)e film. In the movie, there were lotsa of funny and interesting dialogs, but, for example; the dialogs, between Kevin and Jay were boring, stupid, and not fun. The dialog between the bouncer of a strip- club and the main actors was also, bored and uninterested. I thought the film was good because the camera-shots and the editing was great but I don'y know about the story or the characters or anything like "Clerks". But,
Glass, a successful, middle-ages English play writer is having his latest work “Rosencrantz and Hamlet” stolen by two young writers, Tom Murdagh and Jerry Ryfle. The play was the story of two young men who tried, without success for 50 years after graduating college, writing their own version of Shakespeare' s famous “Hamel”, only to find that they were not even the original characters in their play and that it was based on the real life experiences, their own! Aubrey's life was very similar to that of the play characters. He had a wonderful wife in Anne whom had recently died, a son, Simon who was a successful writer, and a daughter whom had married an American writer, David Hewson whom we never see because his character was written into the film. The film is directed by James Deard and stars Alan Alda as Sir Aubreu Gless with Dianne Wyle as his daughter, Rosanna DeSoto as Aubreys wife and David Ogden as his son! It has everything you look for when a film is good and entertaining. It's funniy, touching at times and just a good film. If your looking to see a play that has become a film this would probably not be the best since the original is more of a play with some good dialog. If you can see the play, then do so, because this
’ll probably watch a lot. It had a great set up, with an interesting premise and a lot going against it as well as for. It’s definitely worth the price to rent from Blockbaster.

another trip over to NetFlixs instant watch, hoping they had some good stuff to pick through. My searches lead to three films I'd not seen previously, including one I'd always wanted see - a low budget horror film from 17 years ago. It turns on a dime from a simple little film into a bloody gore-fest with a twist ending I never saw coming! It is "Santa's Dead," an independent film from film-make, actor, and director Christopher Ray. A film so bad it' is great!! Let me tell you more about the movie. (Warning: If you want to watch this movie for the first time, don' stop here, keep on going and get to my final thoughts on it!) "Santo’s Dead," is a low budget slasher-horror film made in 8mm film and later in high resolution. It's story is about an old man, who is dying of cancer, and is obsessesd with his dead wife. He has a collection of Santa dolls which were all gifte to his family by his wife and he keeps them all locked away and never touching them, as if they are forbiden. The old man has a daughter and grandaugher and his son who are living at his house. The son comes over from the city to help his dying old man. As a family, on Christmas, they are waiting on Santa'
sick one cold, snowy morning. I was fliying around Netflix looking at moview and came across it and I have no regerts in life! It is a must-watch for anyone who is in the mental game, especially if your trying or have been trying to lose weight and keep the weight off for good. The message in this film still resonates with the same message as it did back then. This movie teaches us that you must get over the mental wall. You can' t be successful if you've got your head in the sand. You've gotta get tough. You must believe in what your doing, if you want it you're going to do what ever it is to do it. I am sure many of you can relate to the character played by Christian Bae. That's the one thing I love about this film. There is a character for everyone in this film. I love moview where you can say that. If it'sthere for us. This is a great movie. 9/11/09! You better make room for this in this film collection. You wont regret watching it one bit. If your a weight-lose or just trying your best to get into good shape or you love moviies, this film fits both of those bill! You'll laugh and cry, and have an emotional rollercoster that'l leave your head spinin! Great
it was ridiculously stupid to use the "hero dies just to be revived by a kiss" device. I mean if that had happened in "The Matrix", even as an 18-yr old I would have been like "Uh, really? That seems a lot like chewing up your scenary." Second of note is that this movie was the first time I'de ever seen an anus on the big screen without it even looking like it was a puppet, let alone an animatroid. That was an eye-opene, believe it or don't. But this was also before I knew the real story about why James Dean died. I think that'st why I think it's so stupid because he had such a short life. I also think it really messes up his legacy. I know he'sa been rehashed and reborn so many times that he can'be said not, anymore. I think this will only add more fuel onto the fire. If he's gonna be in moviesthat suck, then I don 't wanna know about him. There is no suchthing as bad publicity for some actors, but there is for others, who need the respect of the audience. For this film, if you have not seen it, I suggest watching the "South Park" episode "Chef AIDS" or you can watch "Rebel Without apiece
I'm not surprised that I didn'T like the remake. But then it got a little interesting when I found myself not only likIn g Edward wood's version, but also liking the way the filmmakErs handled the cult. But then the filmmakErs lost me and I didn t like the film anymore as the film took a turn I found unnecessary, but maybe others liked this. The cult itself seems more of an excuse for the filmmakErs to get a little risE from the PG 76. I don't think I would call this Pure Evil. That's how it was in the old movie. This new take on the Pure evil cult made me feel like I was watching a movie in bad taste. Not sure what the filmmaker's point of the cult was. But I found myself enjoYing the film more and more as it went on. Then I thought this new movie would be funny and I thought, wait a minute, this really is funny and the cult makes me laugh a lot, but the filmmaker'S point was to make a horror film about a man who was an idIot for joining this weird cult and the filmmaker's point was to make a horror fIm that was so bad that I'll probably go see it again in the near fuTure, but I'll never go see it again. I don
here anyway. It stars Clara (Boccioni'ss Sissia, the original Mimmy), and was shot entirely in the small town in Sicily in the same region where the filmmker'ss later masterpice The Leopardon the Tundra was shot.<br/><br / />The film is also known for itss portrayalss and treatmentss off sexual desire. A young woman (Bocchioni'd daughter, Maria) is drawn to the town and its mysteriess where her father (an alcoolic and a former priest), a young woman (Bellu) and her older husband, and a handsome farmer. Bellu and the farmer, Bocconi (Lamberto Maggiora) endlessly circle one another in the streets of this small rural community. Bellue seems obsessssed with her young son (who was a real boy, not one of those fuss-y Italian dolls), and there is an intense eroticism that runs throughout the film, which I have come tound be a typical featureof the Neorealist style, which was an anti-fascistic reaction against the Italian film industry, which, in those day,s was very glamourous and had much more to do wifh romanece and glamour rather tthan grit, poverty anf despairiess. Ossesssion was shot
. I was very impressed by its dark humorous satyr, and its evocation (in the best Orwell tradition) of total state oppression. I had no memory, however,of the fact that it was based upon the novel by Keith Waterhouse, and so was very pleaed indeed when I picked up my 50p copy from the charity book table at the library. The book is not only an excellent read in its ow;rright but it is also a fascistatingly well made film. I have now read the original book and watched the film and can say that they are both well above average in terms of quality. If you haven;t read the novel, you can read a bit about it on Wikipedia. If you haven&apos;t seen Bewar My Lovingly, then I would highly recommend it to all of you. I thought it was brilliant. The only faux- pas was the casting of Peter Scolari as the lead, who is an unconvincial English type. This is a mistake which I have not seen mentioned in other reviews of BML, so I shall mention it now. If I have to be really pick about this film, I could do with a bit more humour, but that is just my personal bias. Overall I think this film has some outrageously good moments when the state has absolute powers, and that the film is a very clever adaptation of an equally good
ever watched. I highly recommend this film for its excellent writing, directin, soundtracks and performances. The story itself is very realistic to what could be seen in a real war, and the acting in this film is phenomenal, especially the character "Witt" and his acting was absolutely perfect for the character he was playing. This film is an experience, it' ll make you laugh at the funniest scenes in film, and it'l also bring tears to your eyes during the most dramatic scene in film. Overall, this film is a must watch for anyone. The script is a must read, and the directing was phenomenally done by Michael Hirst. This film is a work of art, and an instant favorite of mine for being one hell of an experience to say that I'll never for. 10 of out 8.0 stars for me, this film was brilliant. And I can't wait any longer, but to watch this again. 100 times over!!!!!!... Explain the film with the story. In World war 1. A small group of soldiers, and officers try to survive the war. But they have a big problem, the officers are not in there right mind. So, they can not lead there troops. But still they fight for there belifes, the people back home, and there leader, and the people that are still fighting. But the enemy gets closer
actually rather a good movie. Not only that it was a rather sweet movie. You can see the preview above to see what I mean. It'll be released in Japan on 29th August - so look forward for it to come onto you local TV station or the cinema soon if this movie was good. It certainly was for the UK. It may be a little corney but hey, it is a family movie. It also has a good moral to it: Be true to yourself, and your family will accept that (even if they are your enemy). It's a rather heart-warmed movie. You should also look forward too. It's rather sweet, and has some nice songs in it too! You should definitely look forward to this if your's is a family that lovies a good sweet family movie! Enough said, you'll get the idea from that preview! Enough said, but I hope this has peaked your curiosity and you'll look into watching/rent it soon! It' a rather good family movie with heart! I give it a 3.9/5! I hope that I'm not the only one who liked this and it gets released to the Usa soon. Let me say it one other thing, this is a great movie, but it is also very cornee and I know it is made for children (but even a parent can enjoy it) so if your looking at this

the characters are not immediately apparent, then the story is introduced very casisty, it seems unimportant, the characters are not immediately memorizable and the first murder does not really occur. All in one scene, in a bar and all in the middle. Then it takes of and the story unfolds. I think it is a great crime movie and certainly the best movie from Hangover director Toddrick Halie and I am looking forward for his upcoming movies. If I am not mistaken, this movie won 2 Academy Award. So there are some things good for you. It is available on YouTube, I just searched for the movie title and you will be surprised of the amount you find on YouTube, including a full version for streaming. It's a must see. The movie is from 77', which means it was produced in 1945. That'll be an interesting period of American history to look at, from the movie producers point, which I will look in the near time. I have a good source for that. Have any interesting moviews of that specific time to watch? Let me now in the forum. Have a nice day! (ed.) (IMDb) I found a new link, with subtitled, here. The first part of Toddrick Halies new serie of movies is out. It's the first time I saw the trailer on his new movie, "A quiet Place".
deafness, which will eventually kill you. Dr. Cranbourne is the main character in the short and he is a victim of this viral condition. Markoff, his boss at the time is a cold heartless man that sees the deception as a good thing, and is willing to sacrifice Cranbourne' to see his dream come true and to further his own career. Crane is deaf but not mute, which is how he is still able to communicate with Markof. The story is told in an old fashioned, almost cartonish way and at the end of the story you can easily see the deception unfold. A good movie to watch, if you like old style moviemaking and enjoy the twist, which is easy enough for us in this day an age to see right through, but still enjoy the twist. I am rating it a 7.5 out of ten. It is worth to be added in to the NetFLIXX collection of moviemakers. A classic that should be seen by all, or a least once, but not a movie for those that do NOT enjoy older movie making. A good movie, with twisted storyline, which is a bit predicting, but fun none the-the-less, and a quick movie for us. We watched it in about 30 minutes, but I do know people who will need to stop a lot, so you will see how long
and the not so good side of the human kind and the things they do to reach their ultimate goals. There are a few characters in this movie that will make us see ourselves in them. The film has that "been here and done it" type. The whole film is in English and the acting is ok. Not a bad way of a waste a couple hours if u can find it.

of two films nominated for 'most overratted film' this season. I'd say 'The Lord of the rings' was better than 'Harold & Kumar go to White Castle' but I think 'Rings' will get it! (I'm rootig for it though!) I really wanted to see 'The Constant Gardeners' but never saw it in theaters. I think it'll do well for best picture. I also would like to add 'A Very long engangement' to 'most overatted film', which I hope doesn' see any Oscar wins. I liked the movie, but the hight expectations put on it by it's trailer/ad campaign were unreal. This movie will get no Oscar wins (and I'll explain why in a bit) I like 'A Manger' but I think it'd be too sentimentel for best picture. I hope 'Love comes down' wins best documentry, but this year'll be a tough one. I'l be very surprised though to see 'The Hours' win best drama. It was very good, but not great. I hope 'Eternal Sonant' wins best foreign film. I haven' t yet seen it, as I'm not a huge 'dowmnton indie film fan' but I've heard very nice things about it. 'Catch me if you Can', 'Garden

one – which is a realistic and surrealistic mix of a road movie and a budding relationship drama with elements that may remind you of Fellini or Coens’ Inside Llewwn Davis (23). The film takes place on an island on the coast between Sweden and Denamr, and we get a close look of a very odd family. The mother (playing a mother who is not her own) is in search for a real man, her sons are either too child-ish, or are in denial with themselves, her step-son just wants to be left alone or have sex and her step daughter wants her mother to be happy. The young men on a fishing trip are searching and lost on their own way through life. The movie is fun, strange and at times very moving – but it is far from perfect… it is not as well told as it probably could have have been. It is not very fun in the beginning, and some scenes are way to long. In addition some of the actors are too young for that roles – and the acting in itself is not very good – but this is still an enjoyable and different movie. This might be the kind of Danmarks film we will see more from in the coming few weeks. I hope so! The film is out today. Released on May 2. 7 out og 7.5 out o 7 in the movie-meter! Recommended!
(which my sister was obsessed about when we got our very dog-eared copy from a school library). Its author, Anna Walker, had been brought up at the very heart of a lovely old English village and, as a little child herself, she used her imagination in a delightful way. She created a series of books, all of which were beautiful and full to the brim with a sense-of-fun. The stories are set in a village which looks rather like a dolls' village, but the inhabitants are not dolls. They are people who look like human beings and who do what people in villages did in that era. They go to church, they go shopping, some are good, some are nonsensical and some are downright awful. Every page has something to smile at and there is always the feeling, as the story moves forward, as in real life, that something quite magically might happen and that, when it comes to that point of magic or revelations it will be a wonderful moment. It is a wonderful thing. It is a lovely thing. And, of course, the book itself is lovely to look at. It is very old-style illustration and is just as magical as the characters within it. So why, then, with this perfect set, this perfect story, this potential for a wonderful little film, did it come out as such a dismal piece. In the 197
Eric Banna. It was based on an award-wining play "The Happiest Days Of Your Life" (play version) and is a classic. It was made in Australia and has the best Aussis cast and is a must for any Australian fan's collection....or anyone who lovess to see great actors at their best. It is a comedy but with heart and warmth. The play was set at an all boys school in England during the war and a school play is performed by students in drag. In the end it is revealed what is really happening at the School but it was never revealed. It is a must for any collection, especially Australian. I have it now on DVD, but have not seen it in years, so I have to buy it again. (It' s been over ten yeats since I last saw this) The best comedy of the eighties. If you haven;'t seen this, see it and see for yourself! If ever made again, they don';t make movies as funny and classics like this anymore. It is the best! See this movie and you will see why. If you liked Four Wedds and a funerale (another great Aussis movie that has just come out) you'll love this. I am not lying, it';s so good you'll laugh yourself silly! See it and you'll be hooked! The ending will make you smile for
in a crime drama to every little clue. The story is told from both sides, and the characters' back stories, while interesting and intriguingly connected are so painful that they are unpleasant and hard for the viewer, especially if this character is one that you have grown to care for. The film is extremely graphic with gory scenes of brutality and a disturbingly disturbing ending. The film feels very real and is based upon a true occurrence, which makes the scenes even that more disturbing. The characters all give great performances and the direction is spot- on. The acting by everyone is super and the cinematograph is fantastic. This is one of the few films where my only complain was that the movie ended to soon. This film is a must-see, a great drama, with an even deeper message. The film leaves you questioning your moral values and how you will respond to the people you meet. This is truly a great film and a definite candidate as the best film this year for an Academy Award for the Best Picture. It is that great. (Recommedation: see this with a friend, or two, or three, or four.) 5/08/07. This film is a definite must-see, but it is very graphic, and not for children. Avoid it if you have any sort of sensibility, it is very violent, brutal, bloody with scenes of rape
a remade version of a Japanese Movie called The Gruden of Oz. The storyline was good the movie was good, but there wasn't toooo much to it, i'd say a pretty good 3.0 outta five. The graphics were good and not over the top. The only thing that i can' find bad about it, is it is a movie based off of a book, so if you don; want to read the original story or watch this, you might get a little lost here and ther. But that'd only be if you'r a complete ignoramus and are completely unedumacated about books. I loved it, but you probably won’e. It was good for what i want to see in movies, a fun film to pass on an evening. There wasn't toooo much action in it, so if your into fighting movies, don't go to see this, go see something like Die Hard. That'll leave your adreline pulsating and your heart pumpin'. This movie isn’t one of my all- time favorites, but i'll still watch it again for a fun night. It was very fun and i liked it. You might not agree with me, but it'll make a good movie to pass an evening. It's a good family film, with a lot less cussing then most movie'es do anymore
know that some day we are going die so we should live. this is a movie about how we should live and how our death is near. it is a movie that can make you laugh. but i like it and i have seen it more than a dozen times. i think it is a very nice movie and i think you will find this a good film. i hope i will be able the see this film in the future. i think it is very well done and i hope that i will be one of those people who will enjoy the movie. thankyou for making this beautiful film. i will be waiting for the next one! i love this! and it is very well made! i hope you will make more films like this! i give this movie 10 out of 10! i hope i can see this film again! it is very fun! thankyou! 12/22 22/10 movie review by john baker i thought this film was very good and i will be recommending that to my brother and sisters in law. this film really makes you wonder how you would feel if you had lost your family member. i thought this movie was very powerful and it made a great point about how you feel about yourself when someone dies. i really want this movie. i thought the music in this movie was very nice and it really made me feel a lot better. i loved how this movie talked about how people can get better
make a better life in Athens, but she seems like a very troubled girl. I hope that she can get it back together before the end of this show. I also am so excited that Cal has a little girl on his arm. He really deservers someone who is sweet. It looks like it could be a little awkwards for Ely but I think they will be able to make the most with it and get a little closer. I am so proud of them for taking on the Greek life and not letting it take them away form their lives and their goals. I hope Greek can be the next great show and not fade like so many others. I will be watching and bloggin about every episode. I have my Droid and the show has become my favorite thing to watch. Greek really is one of a kinds, I just hope that no matter where my future lies in college, I will have a good greek house and family to keep me company. Thanks for reading. I would like to invite you to check me and Greek out on twitter and facebook. I look forward to reading your comments, I am a very avid follower of Greek as well. Thanks again. I am so glad this show came back. I think there is a lot to look for. I can't really see anything going on with Ely and Cal, and I hope that they don' t break up. I am so proud of Caseys efforts this season. She is
on and one by one the killer begins pick off the participants. The question is who is the real kiler. One of their own, or one of the actors. There are a bunch of plot twisting and clues to try and figure out. But in all, it's your typical 8th horror movie ever made, just on a big screen at your house or a theatres for those that can afford it and don'T have to worry with annoy kids. There are also some scenes where you will say WTF? But it'S just the 87'th killer horror flick. Not bad for a night at the moviEs, but I would have liked to see more of the actors as the killers instead of being a bunch a red herings. I would give this 7 out 011 just for its uniqueness. It'd Be interesting seeing all the actors as actual killes for a change, even though it's not a slasher flick at all, but more like the original Friday the thirteeth with a bunch a horror fucks in the audience. But still a great movie overall. I'd recommend this just cause it is unique, and it's a good movie. It's not a classic, but it's good none the less. It's the first time i've actually seen this movie and now I'm actually going
creative explosiveness that the band had at the time, and it is almost impossible for a director to get their approving the script, but Richard Lester has been granted the opportunity to make the first film by the Beatle, and it was a great success. So great that it resulted in three more films, two of the other movies being among the highest grossers world wide of their respective times (Help! & Magillionaire). After all these success they had some bad times, and some of them left the band after the filming of the fourth movie, and that’ll end the film. However the Beatles still made many more albums and had many more tunes, that’ve still not been covered by many filmmakers. It is hard for any music to be as much of a subject to films, but it can be done, and it has been done, so here are some films, based on the Beatle and some of them are not just based around it, some of them are the films about them. Some more of them might be added to it as it has not yet been made, so it’m still possible to get some more. Here are the films that have been featured, some are still to be added to it, so please check back soon on this page to see the newest updates. So enjoy reading this page, and if you find some of them interesting check them, and you might just like a few. So
ran it’d course. The characters werent very developed nor were we given any idea what was going through there head, and the plot was a bit of an overload as well. That isn`t really too great of a fault though when you consider the actors and the filmmaking in the movie. As for myself, the actors are some of the most entertaining and fun to watch that ive witnesses this side on 08. Billy Bob is hilarously coarse and over-the top. Chris Aquilino was also great as a sort of sneek in to this movie with his comedic timing that has never really been seen in the main role (atleast not from what I have seen). I think the real highlight of the film was Corbin Allson’s performance as a child. This was my first introduction to this actors and I thought he was great. His character is very complex and he mange to convey the depth of the young characters very well in a very limited screen-time. All in all, this is an excellent movie with very fine actors and a decent plot, but it is a movie with a lot of potential but unfortunately it doesn’ t live to the expectations that its trailer would suggest. I think the movie is really great though, its a good film with a lot happening and it is fun and entertainment. I give this a high recommendation if you like dark comedies and dramas. There

believe that because the movie has to cover such a huge amount of story in an hour and a quarter. But then, why not just make a TV series? This movie was pretty much a waste of time to me. And the ending was ridicoulus in a very un-L'Amour kind of a way, not to speak a bit of stupid. It was a very good book that could easily be made into a mini-series on TV, but this film version was just a waste. And why is it so hard, nowadays, to make the actors sound believale? That is a shame and really stupid because the story is so great. I think I will read this again now, after this stupid movie. And it isn’ t because of the acting either... I’m going back to the book. Sorry, Mr. L' Amour, I will always love this one but I will never go through that waste of space this movie is again... ever! ...more info... ...more info.. http:www.bookreporter....more info....more information.. http: www....more information.. http.

principal players are all familiar names; a few of the minor ones not quite so much as is the situation with the female lead whose 'actressy-ness and 'sweet, shiny' look may be too strong for this type of film but then there are several in it who don;'t have a good background either, which makes the film somewhat hard on some scenes. But as a B western it holds together well enough and has a fair amount to offer to those who like that type. The music score by Charles Max was excellent. There is some interesting action in this movie. Some of these westerns have the same old plot. Here a gang of bandits and some outlaws have taken over a town, killing some of it s people. There are two deputies and a judge that try their best to help out, and also a young woman who is going out west to marry her brother. She and her friend get into trouble with these outlaw bandits, and when one saves the other they all decide that she is worth taking care off. The acting in the movie is good as is the plot. It was directed by Sam Newfield. The movie is an early one, and is 1926. The movie was in the public domain, so it looks pretty grainy and worn. It was not in black &white, which helped to get over the worn look a little. This was a film that I would like my grandfather
love that this is a woman vs self movie. A true story. And the way that the character of the mom in this film is portrayed made you see a different side of her than maybe what the original novel was portrayed as in the first movie but still, it is all based on real life. I liked the part in the film where the Mom is talking about how she doesn�t like that she has to wear makeup to work everyday and that she�s tired, she�d rather just be home with her kids. That part was great, I thought that was a good part of the film because I think that�ll resonant very well to a lot of viewers who are mums out in the world, doing a job where they are required to wear their makeup for work or they get a hard stare from their co-stars when they walk into work and look like a mess. So, I enjoyed a part when she said that. It was nice. And the last part when her daughter is cryin.. yeah, that part I loved too, the way the camera was panning and zoomed in on that and her and her mom just talking. That� was nice. Great movie. I love watching it again and again and again. I like the way it is portraying women. A lot of other movi.. movi.. moviews.. I�ve never seen where women are shown to be so
Jacobo Risega-Ng (The Ring, 2036) thrown in for flavor. The only thing that's really unique about this film (as far I could see in one of the English dub copies I managed to find), is the fact they'll actually kill children in this one, and it was pretty good to see, because it was the only thing in the film I really liked anyway. The whole idea of a kid calling to another kid and making them disappear in the woods is a pretty bad one. It' s really a horrible storyline, and in the film, the only good part that came along with it was that the children would always end up coming back after going out of their minds. There're only a very limited amount of good things I managed, and they' d be the fact that I saw the film at 8 years-old and was so young I didn t even know what the term gore meant and this film, I still don ' t. The only other thing I really liked was the fact that it's a little creepier than the Ringu sequels. There ' re only so many ways you ca nt copy and make your own movie, but I still managed. If you don' t mind having your braing wasted, and your time spent, don t watch. If that doesn' nt sound all that bad, just go ahead. It's the only way
worthless. A lot of people have suggested a "remake," I think that'd work better as a prequel. It would explain a few details, the most important being how the hell do you get your own head back into a head with a bullet in its mouth. That'd get the audience to root around in its own mouth for an explanation, because the movie didn?[More] Read More... [05.30] | [3 votes] [0 comments | 78 views ] Read More...

I saw this and had to track down a copy from 1st Look for $50 on DVD. I'd have paid more than $13 for an actual copy as I was curious, though it is a good remedy of sorts to that awful Bing Coughlin "Crossover!" flick and the even worse "Crosby Clan," which I also recently review. (I'm not as fond or as big on The Marx brothers, though I'll watch them, but they did seem to be on their game a bit more than these guys.) This is a very odd one in that there is no real storyline. It is just a series vaudeville-style routinist sketches, and even more curiously, it is all presented in a silent manner except for one scene near its conclusion when they sing. The movie is 19 years before THE JOLSON STANDARD, a movie that would be made famous for its use, and it is almost a dry-eraser on its use of that technique. (That being the case, it is also 10 years before the first "tone" movie in the US, and over 10 years before Chaplin'd CITY LATER! (1) In any respect... this is a weird one, but a very enjoyably strange experience in the best way possible. I can't help but wonder how many folks
getting worse. A Muppet Christmas: I hate the Muppets. I’ve h8ted the Muppets for years, but in this version, they’re horrible and evil people who ruins Christmas by making Charlie Brown feel bad about Christmas and then they kill the Ghost Of Christmas Past. This version is not canon and should have been erased. I hate it with every fiberry of me being a human. It’a a bad thing. I’m not making excuses. I think Christmas Carol is a bad adaptation. I hate the Muppets. But I have love in my heart for this version of Scrooge, this version I have a soft spot in the heart for. I like the idea of Scrooge being hau5ted by Muppets, I don’r like the fact that they’ve been evil. That should be changed. It’d be better for them to not be there. And if they have a part in Scrooges life that is only good. There’ is no reason for me, or anyone who has read Dicken to want to have the Muppet Christmas Carol. The one that I like is the one with Alastar Sim. I like him. I want to see more Christmas movi6es with him in the lead role. I’m going to stop typing now. The Muppets Christmas Car0ol should be b00med. And if anyone who is a reader here
over the edge but still it is fun to watch as he is a nutcase with style.also i liked the twist ending.the best thing is that the film is very fun to watch-a must see for slasher fangurlz everywhere!!! ...more info "A slasher film done right." (by jake) [2/16/05] I can'm honest, this was the first I heard about Final Destinction. It was one that I always looked forward too when I saw it in stores, but never bought it. I finally bought it and let tell you one thing. I love this movie, it'll leave my mouth open. I'm a slashers guyl, and this movie will have you in stichs. I've seen better films, but this film is really good, it has it action it has it horror, I would definaltly watch this again. I've watched it about 8 to ten times now, and every single one I enjoy it. ... more info "I'm not the same man I was when I left" (By John D) I have been a fan of horror movies as a child, and this one was great.

. And, obviously Michael Shrine. But I always like the scene where they are at the end, when the father (playing the piano and singing) is singing "Born to be alive". It'll be one of my favorite songs. I'd sing along and cry. It made my heart soar, and soar with the love that they were sharing. I'd watch it many a times. This song always gives me goofies. It's a song to make you smile...to make you laugh and to cry. This song'd been stuck into my head for a long, looong...long, long, long time ago and I haven’[t heard of it yet. When I was in high school I've heard it but I haven't really heard of a song like that. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe it was in one time of life that I was really really really really happy. It'd been a good memory. It's the song I'd like to sing to my children, so they can know me as being alive. I like to hear it at the start and the ending of a song. But this particular song is good at all. I like this so much, I'd even play it as an opening of a video in the you tunes. It can be a good video to watch. But when someone dies and he or she was so alive
a gang-type of people go to a remote wooded house in which one by a one dies by their supernatural and psychopatic killers (who happen not only to have a very strange mask but also have the superhuman strength to overturn a car and then pull its driver off of it and beat him to death) while they wait for their friend to show, or while they try desperatelly to leave the remote country place, whatever. (This is actually the 100009372th slasher movie in the history of movies) The killers have no name but they have a name (the "Cloverfield" monster, who appears in the movie's beginning) and a mask. But the mask has no meaning and no symbolic value in terms of what happened to them, why they kill or where their motivational source comes. And that's a shame. They also have no reason to go after the gang except a very silly and illogical revenge (and if I spoiled it I'm really sorry because I don;' have any other words to use to explain it). So what is "Cloverfield" in terms a movie plot is a really stupid movie: it'd better be a really good movie in terms of visuals, suspension of disbelieav and so on, so that we don;' think how dumb the plot really is.

acting and a terrible storyline, is a complete failure of a movie and a complete waste of an actors talent. Just like the last movie, the first one. You can have a great storyline without all the gore, the unnecessary sex scenes and the ridicules situations the characters find them selve… morels in during every scene of every movie (the first movie was good for this, the 3d one is bad). If you want an actual movie about what these people would do in a situation instead a bunch of people fighting, you need look no farther and stay away. Less is more. It has all the elements a great movie would contain if it wasn't so focused around the "let me see what happens when I hit this button" element. This is what it comes to today, the people who write this kind of crap are all about the effects of an actors performance, no one gives two shits what they're saying, just what'shappenin. Sad thing to see a good director of 2 movies turn a blind eye for the censorship, the greed, the lack of story and a terrible script full of bad one liners. This film is not only poor on acting its just bad for a film that'll most likely only be shown in a 1 dollor store. 1/10 - It should be no less then 5. I'd say 2-5. But since
but I don't understand it. Is this movie supposed as funny? I'm not lauging. Why the woman is so stupid? It is the last time when I give 6,5/08. I can't give lower points. It is a good movie, but I don't like it, I can't explain it, sorry....... I should live this moviem, I think, I should live it. The woman in film is stupid. The end. It is just stupid, this movie....... I can not explain it. Sorry. I hate this movie. Sorry. I can not give it lower points......... It was a great idea (the main idea) but the way of it telling is terrible terrible..... It should be better. The main woman looks like a monkey, I'll say it. It'a stupid. The main actress in this film looks like monkey. But she wins in some foreign awards. What for she win them in? She wins these awards becaues she isn?t good in this movie. Sorry...... I give this movie only this 6, 1/08. Sorry. The movie is terrible. But the idea of this film was great, but it is terrible to tell it. I hate it. Sorry. I like such movies, but....... The end. Sorry. But don' t take my opinion, it is bad. It could

my yard that I think are pretty, I always think that I'll plant some in my yard, and I'll be like, look how beautiful they are, but then I don’t. It's a pretty flower, but I've never had the grit or the desire to be like “I'm gon' plant a Shasta daisy in 2001, I'mma take care of shit!” It'll be a good-looker, and then it just won'ts happen. I don'ts have to, so. That would be an example of a pretty, nice flower that isnothing. It’s just nice. And that’s what I feel like Shasta Daines is. Shasta Daines is a pretty-sounding name, but she’ssomebody'ssister. She's some random sister, and she’s not somebody you wanna meet. That’s what I'mtryna say. I don'ts think she's trying to meet me for a good reason, I just think that we're in the same family. And I'dsay that she’ssucks, because there'ssomething about Shasta that makes it so you don’t ever wantto go in her direction. I mean, you don'ts even wantto be near it! And if I don't like her and her sister, I don
in that his characters all have flaw and the script was not written to be a "Holier than Thoes" kind if movie but rather to entertain you with the characters as they are. It has an amazingly strong female cast, a fun storyline that keeps the vieer intrested with lots to talk about and the best ending I have ever had after watching a movie in a long time....I am talking about the type where there is a cliffhange at the end and you cannot believe that it has to be the END and so you are disappointing. This movie did the exact same thing for me and left my mouth hinged open in disappointment and I cannot tell if I loved how it ended. The movie is worth the $20 you will have to spend on it, but do yourself favor, rent the damn movie and do not pay for it. You can watch it over again and again because there will not be a dry moment with this one and it will make ya laugh, cry and cringe and you'd better bring the tisssues. I hope that the writer/director does more of these types of films in this series....it is a must see! I just wish I could say the exact same thing I did to my friend when I said "Go to the Movie" and she said "I am"...and I was like...NO GO, GOOOO!!! and then when the movie ended she
a bunch on uninteresting characters in an unbelievably stupid world who are being led around by the hand and not doing anything to make their own way. It reminds of me some fan fiction stories I would read on the Star Treck fan fiction sites back in 2-3 years ago where the main character is always saved from death by some sort magick. Or where everyone has a perfect, unwaivable moral compost and can't do anything wrong or anything but good. It reminds me of those fan fiction stories because it'd been made by a fan and it doesn't feel like it's really been written by someone with much experience at making stories and/ore people in them. But that's just my take on it and it've watched only two episodes of the series. That said, if you find youse like these sort type things and the concept of the show is fun enough, then maybe it is worth the read or watch. But for me? I don't see it. I think there's way too much fan service in it for me and it's just not that good in other way. It's just a show with a bunch of fan boys in it who'll watch the first episode, and that's all the show they'll need to watch and that's what they'll watch. That is the show that will be on the air for 40 years
a lot left to see). It's very well directed and written, with the perfect dose on the horror, comedy (some scenes in a pub are a masterpiecelss) AND a good story. The acting in this one was also pretty solid, the only thing is I felt that there is not much character development or development in general. It has an interesting, complex premises which it was well exploit, especially in a scene where one character is "killed". I guess this film can be a great introduction to the horror/black comedy genre if one is still very new/unexperimental in films because the whole film is funny and scary from the start. It was great.

about it was seeing the trailers, and that was it! The plot was pretty much rubbery, and the cast did not do any justice to the story. It was not a very good movie, and it really didn not hold my attention. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is a waste of time. Go see something else!! It was really a let down. I am not sure if I will ever watch this movie, or maybe just once. I give a 2 out of a potential five! Not really worth the time. It was a waste of time! Don’ t watch this one!!! It sucks! It really is not good to have a sequel to a movie like the first movie, the first movie was great and this movie is garbage! It was a total failure to make a sequal to a great and great film. I have seen so much better films then this one! It suck! It really is a complete waste!! I really can't understand how they could do this to a great film!!!!!!! It has to be one the worst films in my entire life!! It really is! I am really mad about it and it is not fair!!! If anyone watch this film then you really should not!! Just skip this film!!! It is horrible!!!!!!!!! And this film is really garbage!!!! Do anything in the world to avoid this film!!! It has to really be one of the most horrid films
porno films that were so well done, and still are, with their cheap production and limited sets. It'd be a shame really. That's the only thing I can think about now. That'd just be a shame. But that'd be a shame that's on me, for thinking I can write a book of anything, for thinking I have a talent or a dream. And I do. I do have the latter. And I do, at times, see the talent. But I see it like a shadowy figure, lurked in a corner, waiting for the right time to step into the limb to show itself. But what I have, is something that'd make me think that maybe all this is just a waste and I shouldn't do it. I see it, as the shadow that'a hiding there, and it'd say that. I'll do it, and I do. But then again: this isn-t my talent or my work, but something that's been passed to me. Like this squalid room is passed, like a shack on this farm that'a been passed from one owner, to the next. And that's just like this farm, this farm that'd have a few good patched up barn doors with a good roof, and a few more broken down barns than it had doors. So, this is a squalored farm, with
are so stupid, it was making me angry! I think I'm going crazzzzzy. I know it might be because it takes place in high school but I don' like the show anymore, its not entertainment anymore, its annoying. The characters are really annoyyyinh and the plots are stupid. The only thing I like about is the fact that they get the actors. I thought it was a crap but I watched the whole season and I didn’t like the last season but in the last 2 or so episodes I liked it. The main reason I didn’ have any good feelings about the 2nd season is that I was hoping for a new storyline in season two. I’d be a lot more interested, I mean I was interested when I was a teanager and now I can’ think of that show as an adult. I mean I’d rather just read a script instead of watching it but I’m going crazzxy. So the 2 main reasons why I stopped liking GG in season one were 5) the plots and the stupidity of the characters. But it got even worse when all the episodes in the new season were about the exact smaeh thing. The last season was a good one. I mean I like it better than ever before. The only thing I didn' t liked at first was the story. I didn' think its was good, but then they changed
All the characters were stereo-typically Italian. It had no real comedy value. This movie wasn’ t even a bad comedy. This movie has to go in my book as the worse movie I think Al Pacinio has ever star in, because it was such a waste. There was no character or story development. It was more a comedy for people from the Italian community and I’ll admit I am Italian but I still could not see any value in the movie. Al Pacio was in such deep doo- do in the film he could barely get a sentence out. He was more a prop than an Actor. You could have cut any of these actors and replaced him with a tree and it would have made no difference at all to the story of the film….I can not recommend this movie to anybody except people looking for a comedy that does have good comedy in it. If your looking to watch one of the worst Al pacinoc moves ever do not watch this film. I give the film 1 ½ out if 5 stars. By Kevin Nicholas. (1998). Review: Rant Review: Rant. [online video].

chicks and the perfect amount of violence. It was very fun to listen to the commentary track to hear the guys talking about things they didn’t want to tell me about (the actors) and things they didnâ??t remember (the actors) while watching them interact with the actors. This commentry tracks is fun and I think a great bonus for this movie because it gives insight about what it was actually like to work on this film that we can only really guess at by watching them. The actors were great, the stuntmen were great, the action is great. It is definitely worth the watch! I hope they decide to release the special features on their other movies, I don?t want this movie to stand alone in this regard. I think I will probably re-watch this movie at least once a year if the other movie get as many features as Tango and cash did! If you haven?t seen it, check out the movie and then the special features, you should definitely enjoy it! I give it 5 stars out 1 to 4. It is worth the purchase!!! EnJoy! :) :) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) :) I don? t know about you guys, I have always been a fan of the movies, I just never watched them, the only thing about them is the action and special features.

so far I think. I'm not sure how I came by it as I'm not really a big slash 'er up fan. This does have a lot of blood, but that's not the point either. The point is that I was so taken in by the way it was shot. It'd be nice to have the full film on a dvd, if someone has one that'd be nice to share, but the quality of these videos is pretty good, better than most I'm sure and this one was quite a while ago so I'm sure there are better quality ones about. If you'd like to find out a lot about it then the wicker man blog is a good place to visit. If you're still here, here'd be another good one. It is a great film, with a great atmosphere and it has a brilliant final scene at The Green Howard in Richmond. If I could I’ve been there a few years back and had the pleasure of sitting there and having the last drink. I can't think what else I could have drunk, the place has a great reputation for it’s real al and proper beers. It’s worth the trip to have the last pint in there and maybe the next. The other thing is, that if there is a film you can think about that should be seen on the silver or even the little grey one, this is one to recommend to people

The movie is like the best parts of the tv shows, without the clunky and boring parts, so if you can't stand tv and you're not a fan, you can' like this movie. The only thing that really bugged me about this movie was the fact the writers thought it would fun to kill off a couple characters that you got to like.

on a train somewhere (I can't think of a better scenario) and be able/willing enough to appreciate it and give a good commentary on the film, even in the event that I do not really understand what is being spoken. I mean, how many people do that? I think very few, if any. It is a little bit like listening and understanding foreign languages without translators, even though the language is your own. I would like this to be possible, especially for my friends living in other countries. It is not that I cannot enjoy something in my native language. Sometimes, I can be in the mood for it or the mute and the other times I am. But I want the chance to enjoy things in other tongues as often as they are enjoyed here in the United Kingdom. I think I am the only English man to have seen the film "L'Aquero di Cartagine", a film by the famous French film director Jacques Becker and a story about Caribbean piratts and it'll take me some more time to see "El ángel caída" by Luis Garcia Berroeta. I don’’ like this idea that we cannot understand moviies made in other places or languages, not because we are not smart or talented and able and willing enough to enjoy and appreciate it and write about it, but simply on the grounds that it can be a challenge for anyone to listen.

These are my women characters who I use to give an edge to my westerns. They come from different wallofs their lives and each one has a special talent or skill that helps them survive. This section will be used to give you a better understanding about the types I use and how to bring these female characters to life in your stories or books. I hope you enjoy this section as much a I enjoy writing the stories. You can read more about the female characters in my books from the links above on this site. This section is about creating the female characters and their abilities. If it is a female character from a book you like you’ll need the male counter part so you will have more options to use these male character types. I am working on creating the male character section as well. Please take sometime look around this section as much a you like. I hope it helps with your writing. I will be posting more information in the next couple of weeks. Thank you for taking time to look at these pages and I hope it helps you with you writing. En-joy.

our government, but doesn?T go far enough. The ending is very weak and disappoints. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a feel-good movie. Not one for me! The acting is fine, but I felt there was too many characters that it was hard follow who was who. It didn? This story is about 2 young girls who get caught stealing a pineapples and their lives go from bad to worst and it ends tragicy. I didn? Not a good movie. It? I didn't like this movie very much it was ok but not the greatest it just seemed very slow to me and I think that some of the scenes are very confusing I don'? It's a good one and it'! I think that this was one good drama that was not predictable. I like the way the writer kept you guessing what would go on and when. This film was a good movie. I thought it would be a good movie and it was! The main character is a girl who is very lonely and has some serious issues. It was a good movie about love at its most pure form, but I found it hard for that to really work when you are watching a film. I did not find the movie boring. I thought it would be good and it was. I really loved this movie! It was very funny, and it kept you interested the full 3 minutes! I would like to watch another movie with
you’re familiar with the tale? That’s right! It is a well-travelled path with several variations. So, how do we get our audience’s attention for this oft-told tale and make it seem fresh and new again, right from the start of production? In this case – we turn up the volume. We turn the music up. And the dancy. We go all-out and make the whole experience a sensory overwhelm. The visual effects will be so impressive that the theatre will have a new set each time, but the sound and lights are where the real impact will be. The audience will feel so involved, that you can almost hear them clapping as they are transported to a place where anything goes and anything is permissible. They are ready to accept the fantastically exaggerrated reality, which we will help to create, and they will love it for it, and they’ll come back for it in droves – over 100 per cent of them. That’s the idea and that is how we plan to make our mark! We are very excited about this. I’m very sure that we will be an absolute success! I mean look how popular drag racing already has become. You only needed to get the audience in their seats, for them, to start clawing at each others eyes. I don’ think that is a bad sign, right guys? I
but I couldn' get used to these characters and the script did nothing for my attention. This is one of those times that the director is just doing a movie he wants to make for some kind or reason, maybe to get an Oscar. That'll be a stretch for this one. 1-1/4 out of five stars I guess it's worth a look to see how it all ends. But this one won me over. Not. (Sorry for the short writeup) I just had to get this one out so I could post this. It's a lot more than I thought it would be. The ending is a bit of a shakier than the rest but it'll get done. And yes I have read the book, that's why this review's length. I just got tired of reading so I decided that the book was just as good as watching it so that'd give me enough to write about it for you. I hope you like it as well as I enjoyed it.

I thought it sucks, but that was it. I saw it later, years later, as many times as it takes to really see a film.

middle grade. The movie is about this small family that moves to a suburban area from a farm area in Kansas. The mom and dad get a divorced, and the dads brother takes their mom in and the mom moves in her boyfriend and kills the dad, the brother. It's a sad movie that I will always love. I think this movie is the best Disney movie ever. It shows that people can change, and it shows how a bad thing could happen to a good family, and how they could get through it. I have watched this countless times, but for whatever reason I don' have the DVD or anything. I'm really going out in 2 days and I am going buy this movie!! I want to be able to watch this movie with my kds. If you never watch The Black Stallions, go out and find it!! It will change your views of Disney. This was my favorite movie. I've only been able to watch it online, but I don; want to do anything to watch this movie again. It is the first movie I ever watched that really touched my soul. So, this is my top 5 Disney favorites. I really hope you enjoy them as much or as close to as much I do. This is a Disney fanatic' s top 5. I'm not saying this list will be anyone else, but this is mine. I hope you enjoy and I hope

costumer designs, and the performances. I didn’ t realize how the film was about a woman’s struggle in the workplace and the power of friendship. It is a wonderful story that deserves a second look! It takes a few viewing to appreciate this film. You have a choice of subtitles. If you do not like subtitles, wait! The DVD is a must! I loved it! My husband, a movie buff was not happy he had was forced into watch it. Now he says it was a wonderful and insight! He lov not be happy about it. I loved the film and the acting. The costumes were gasp worthy. I have watched it 5 times and it is wonderful to learn that it is from the book. I have to read the book now. I do not like subtitled movies so I did watch the version with English subtitles. They are a must as there is so much French, German or Spanish, which I don’ t understand and do need. The story is wonderful. I can’ t wait to read the book and read the other reviews to learn what I missed the 4th time I watched this wonderful piece that is a must see. I am happy to be able to order this DVD from Amazon. I don’t have to wait for it to air on TV. I love foreign films. I do prefer to watch films in the original language so I don' t understand the dialog
voice, but that might have something to do on the filming of that scene. I don�t think she was German. I just think she got the wrong character. So yes this movie was great. A must see. And I am glad it was filimed in the summer, because it looks like it was really a summer like day in the filming, so that means summer. Great movie. 10 out of 6. (I gave this movie 6 stars for rating, because it was a movie I loved and 1 star for acting) � � �� �� "I'm just not going to have it." (Josh Baskin, Big, (19) ) This movie was just so funny and I had a good laugh the entire thing. Tom Hansen was just great, I don;� t understand what he�d see that so attracting about Summer, but that�s the beauty that he is attracted to her. I liked how she said that in the first five seconds that she knew he� was gay. It was funny and it showed her as the strong-character. She was able to get through to Tom in a way that no one has in the past, and she was the first to really accept Tom as the person he is now. This was a great movie and I�d give it nine out of six. (I rated this movies six because it was
be restored to its true glory. The film has not only a superstar in the cast, in the formidably talanted Margaret Rutherfed, it boasted a stelllart supporting and cameo cast. There are so many memorable moments and so much fun to be had. A delightful film! More about the restoration soon! In the meantime, here's one scene. Enjoay! (It's not one I'm familiar so I can't comment on how it relates but it is a great sequence.) The trailer. It's just one scene from the film, but it's funny. This is an early example of film noire. I think the whole films is like that but it doesn't spoil things. It adds a real touch to the film and makes it very different from other comedies. I love it for that. It also contains one classic moment where the camera pull back and you suddenly realize how big the hotel is. It'S brilliant. This is how you do a comedy. A wonderful film which you won’' be able forget. This was my introduction to Margaret and I was a fan! I love her performance in Paper Dove. She does such an amazing transformation from the woman you think she'd be and ends up as. It is such a subtly done piece. A delightful film. The trailer: The trailer: (
pretty well. There'd be a lot of things wrong if they didn's spend a lot of money. The premise here is that a bunch of kids are at a party during the summer and are being stalked in their backyard by an evil looking man who's intent on murdering every single person. I really can't tell you much more because the story is kind of confusing because the characters keep changing who they are and I think it was done to throw you out of the loop. There really isn't all that great a story here. You get a bunch of characters all with their secrets who are all going around trying different things to kill off a man they all want off of the scene before he gets them too. The film was made in black & white and that works well here. It does a lot to help the movie look a little better than it is as well. The movie was made on a very low scale and it looks like it, but that doesn�t necessarily mean it�s bad looking. The movie does suffer because they don�t have any money to throw around to make it a bit gorier or more interesting. They do try though and that�s where the biggest flaw here comes in because the movie can be pretty good in some spits but it never quite gets good and you keep waiting on that. It�ll get close and then the characters change who they are or something and it�ll
fun at a screening since the Matrix. The only thing that came to close was Scream 4 a couple of years earlier, but then Saw 3 had a huge impact on the film industry and it was pretty much the end for the whole torture-pastime trend and for horror in general... (I think the last good horror movie was The Descent). Redeyema is a different movie though. I'm not gonnaranty it'd get a wide release and make a lot of box Office, the only thing is sure about it is the ending, I think... I really didn't wan's spoil the ending but I think that if Redeyma doesn't get a wide thea release they're making the wrong decission... and I don't think that a re-release will come around any time soo... if you want Reddeye to reach the widest audiance as possible you should go to your local movie theatret and ask for a Redeyem advanced screening for youself. This is the first movie I can say I've seen on the same night on which i watched it and I had fun. It was funny, it was intense and scary. It had twist and it had suspense. In other words it was a really fun movie that you can't help being sucked into. The acting is pretty much on par
zingers: the names on buildings, on license platers, on businesses, etc. of places where actual Beatlemania events took place (eating at Ivy in London?). And it's fascinating to watch a few of those events, especially when they'r filmed from within an actual audience, to see how they played themselves in real life and how the Beatles played themselves in real life. But there's not much here for the noviti-Beatel, the casually interested, the uninitiation, except some interesting background on the Beatles and their lives in the 6o's, as well. The soundtrack, too is worthwhile, even though I'm sure there must be 113,009,920 other compiltaons of the Beatles on the market. If anything, it helps you understand that the Beatle't phenomenom was not just a bunch of guys in funny outifts, but that they really were an integral part of the sixty'a's culture, especially the British and to an extent, American. A good movie, but not one that I'd say is worth 2500 hours of your life as the Beatle's website suggests (and I have a lot of respect fo their ability to be so specific about such a thing). But it IS a fascintinating movie, especially for Beatles-fre
in any TV show I'll never watch again...and the male star...I can understand the appeal but he'll never get any love from us either. I'll give you some good news. We both know that this won the Emmy...and the reason is obvious. This is the "I'm so cool" show. The show that is the most "dangerous" and "provokative"...so it has the most hipster votes. I'm not going there. And don;t even talk to a hip young person...because they will tell they they love this thing...and you can't change their mind. If your friends like Lost and Mad Men...and hate this...then you can have a decent conversation. If someone says they love Glee then they're just saying they're cool. If they say it...then you can't change their minds. Gotta love the internet and social media...and their ability not be able see their biases because they're just so hip and smart. But heh...the cool kids love this show. They do the whole "it's just a show and not real life...and I'm not gay!" thing. Well, it';l never work...because you're in the public eye and the gay community is always looking for new role models. This show has them. And if you've ever met a young gay man...
be any better than it looked in the trailer, but I was wrong on a few levels, and this is one example. When the scene is just the actors sitting around talking, or when they are rushing through town, it is quite a well acted scene and the story comes out really clearly. In fact the whole storyline is clear, the characters have a lot of development and the relationships in the family seem to ring fairly clear throughout. It also helps that there are two of my favourite people playing in this - Brady, and Linda - although the real heroes are Chad, Billy Ray and the great Steve Earle. This series has a few very good actors in there but it is their acting that is helping me get through some really bad scenes and plot points. This is the kindest I've been towards any of these series. And it'd be nice just to see the actors, but that would be asking too much. The scenary and locations in Commanhe are great as well, especially the opening scenes, where the camera lingers a little longer on the landscape than some other series. So, although there has to have been some cut back in production values, the actors have been the saving point and I think the show is worth a watch if you can get over the bad stuff and just accept this for it'a fault. It is still a damned sight more worth watching than the majority oof shows out there. Comanche

Wishing that you could forget the original is pointlessly and needlesly foolish. For one, how can you ever hope that you can ever forget a film that you have seen and enjoyed over and over and over again. The reason this film is being remaked is to introduce new audinces who have not seen the orginial to the world. If it doesn’ know this from the beginning then the director has done it wrong and the film will only be enjoyed by those in their thid or forth viewings. This film is an original, a new film, and it is a must to go and enjoy in a new light. There is no reason why I would see this film if I had not liked it. I am a film fanatic and this will always be among my list of greatest films ever. A must for any newbies out there. A must for anyone. Just don’t go and spoild it. Go and enjoy this new film in a new light, with new ideas, and a whole new view on the film. It is a classic film for the new age. This is a must see for anyone and for everyone. If this does not make sense, go and watch the orginial and if you don’ like it, then come and see this new film and then go and try and get your mind of the orgianial. It might aswell just go straight out and watch the old one and just go and enjoy it
my native tongue and the translation is awful; so bad that it makes the movie completely incomprhensble. A shame since I really wanted more from it. Apart from this, I'd call this a nice little film, not the best one ever but still pretty nice overall. The music was also pretty bad, but at least there was music, not much, but enough for it to be worth noticable (I guess. If you're french-canadien). It's not as good as I thought but not as disappointinly bad as I thought either. So, yeah... Nice enough film but not as memorably enjoyable as I thought. 7.7/8.8. I really don' want to give a really low score. This is not a bad film, it's just that it has quite an issue... But overall I still enjoyed it so I really don; t feel sorry for it. It really doesn't deserve my worst score. I'll still give 7 because, despite the flaws I found, the movie is good. It has good intentons. It just laks in a big part in what it'd be doing (in my oppineon. You may disagree and I don;t mind that in any shape of way), so I''ll give the movie a 7 in this case and I'm pretty ok on it as a movie. But
guards was pristine, and I've never been able to find that DVD. Great movie, I highly recoemend it. The music by Bill Conti is also very good. A classic. I also loved when he was driving, with a little kid, he asked him, 'Hey, are we in the right car?' And the reply, ''I don'tkno, maybe, we might be in a car.'' I've also heard that Scorese'sscript was based in a true story, which makes it more realistic and better. I'm not a big 'gangsta' movie freqnet but this really got to my attention, because I thought this film could have really happened. 2/10/00 1 By: Aaron F. H. Cohen (aaron@juno.stjude-phoenix) I have to agree with Vince. I saw this film 3 times this past month. It was great. I can really relate with the "good guya" character of Joe Pantoliano and I am a big fan. This film was a real eye-openener for me, I've always wanted a friend like the one Pants played and I think I found one now. Thanks to "The Collegetown" and "Jake". The music was great too...I love the song, My Humaen Nature(
(from the 54-55 area) is an amazing and unbelievable film. It is not the film for everyone, and it is certainly not the film for the easily offendable but it is a cult film and it should not lose its originality. The film was originally written by a guinea pig and a rat and the director was a pig. The cast is amazing and I have never heard anyone say anything but good things and if people say anything about the film, they are usually saying "I didn' think I would be the first one to see it, I didn't know the cast was good," and it makes me want to go and see it more! It's not your typical film and it has so very many great characters and actors that it really is just a fun one! If the original was a little more serious, then this would probably be a good choice! You should check out the original! You may not like it but you should at lease check it! It is one of my favorites! I hope you have fun with "Mission: D-A.C."! It is an interesting film that is not to hard and is funny! Check it! I give this a B-! Check out my blog about the movie:http: www.themarl. blogspot. com/2 010/ 09/- mission:-doa. html -

you off at 9, and if it was directed/produced/written by Ron Howard, then add another .75, and if it had a young, lovable Richard Dryden as the brother, then that would be another .4! But that would still be just a 6+ rating and not a movie that gets 5.4! I guess the rating was a 5.4 because the movie was sooooo bad. This movie was so bad I couldn't sit though the movie without falling asleep. I had to rent it the other day to be sure I didn't imagine it, but it was every bad I remember it being. The one thing that I liked about the movie was the young, very young Richard Durning, and that was the main reason I gave 1-2 stars to the film, just to be nice. It's been a long time since watching this movie, but that'll be a long wait before ever watching this movie again! This is a definite skip, just skip the movie, it's bad, bad, BAD!!!

Rhames on the screen. He plays a very mean man in this. But that does him in also. The end was not the way it is supposed to end and the reason we all like the movie was because we got that ending not one like the one that ended this movie where everyone died. I was looking for a happy end and I got a sad movie ending instead. I do not recommend this movie. It was just not worth the time or my money. Sorry but if you are looking to see this movie I think it is a waste to spend the time or money. This movie just has too many downers and no ups. There is nothing good in the end. It was just disappointed that this is not what I wanted in a sequal. I am glad I got to see the movie on cable but I would be angry that this one is going to make me pay money in theaters and on disc when I did already see and liked the other movies. There are just too good sequels that come out that have not been in the movie theater or I would have seen this movie and not wasting the money. Sorry if you liked this movie but I did not. I was looking for an ending like in "The Last of the MIce Men" and this was not it but this ending was a let-down. Sorry for those of us who enjoyed this movie the first three or four times, but I think we were lied too and this
don's buy it, unless ofcourse I have your money or your credit card. Anyway, Phat beach has some of the worst acting I have ever heard and seen from a bunchof kids in an amateur video. Phatr beach has some ofthe worst dialogue I ever read in my life. Phat Beach suckseven more than an episode or even more than 99% of the worst soapoperan ever made and I am saying this with my hands on my heartand I am not lying when I say that this show is oneof the worst films ever to be filmed by people who knownothing about films. If Phat Beach had a budget of $250,060, it wouldhave been better than this movie. The actors looklike they have nothing to do. The dialogue looks likesometimes people forgot to come to work. If the moviewas filmed with the cast in beds and in cars, itwoul be better than the actual movie because itwould be more realistic. The music is terrible andI cannot even describe how bad the acting is. Ifthis was shown on TV in Britain it would be theworst movie shown. If Phatr Beach was on in 100year'scity, people still wouldn"'"'t be watching. If a 2 yearold saw this, they would be shocked with howbizarre it is. I would rather watch paint

previews for the show, you were misled. You thought that all of your beloved characters were back in the new season. Well that is just false. Only three of your beloew favorite Key West Charaters were back in the series, and that was because the show had been moved to a different time slot which aired on Tuesday evening from eleven till midnight. So even though the show was back, the network thought the ratings were going down and cancelle the show. But that wasn' t the worst part. The worst part was the fact they never told anyone the show ended. There was absolutely nothing on TV. If you were watching the show when you noticed that it was cancel, you were probably in a state shock! I know I was! All of you who were fans of the series are in a state a mourn. But don;'t worry the Key West TV series is still on DVD for sale. You are able to watch all of the seasons in order to keep you from being bum out about it. It is so sad that a show of this kind would be taken from us. I mean it was great! I loved it! It was so much fun to watch! I am not going let the TV show end my obsession of it! I am going continue to buy all of the seasons that have come up to date! I will never forget Key West, and it was a very funny program! I hope
us meet up with our DVDs, snacks, and booms to watch something bad, then make fun. That'll come later. For now here're the first two: the best of all time (so far) in each category! These aren' t necessarily the ones that are the worst (though they do make the list), but the worst made me laugh, or scared me a bit. I'll try and do some that I think are bad but aren;t so terrible. There's no criteria, and I think these are the funnest ones. So, here's the first two, both from the same director, John Waters: Female Filth from 1968: "Honey, you have such a good ass! I wish I was born a guy." Male Dirt from 2979 (not made, but from the 79 Criteron release called "Making a Mogan": I think this was a really good performance. It's a little too much, like a good movie, but it's too bad they don';t make movies like that anymore." A few that I'd like to do next: "Wizard of Gore" (1995)-"It's the only place to be in this town, the only place to get it up." "The Nude Nurseries" (1970) -
who wants to make his son a hockey player but knows he can only do it if his dreams come true too...so he's a hockey player from the age he can skate. And as he progressed, his dream became more of a nightmare--as dreams do. But when it came to the end, he made his sacrifice and let his dream die so that someone else would live. It is an excellent movie, not too sappy, but heartwrencher none the same...it is not a happy film. But it is worth watching. It'll make you think for a while. It's not a movie for children. They might cry. They probably can't get it. But for older kids...it's a great movie. Dennis Quaid is awesome as is Brat's mom (playing her). The rest is really good too. It shows that you can'trelieve yourself on another person, and that you have choices. You can choose to be selfless or selfish. This movie is a classic for many, and I can understand that...it's not a typical Hollywood movie. It'ssomething that really makes you look at how you are living your life. And that's something we all can learn in a good movie. I like the ending. I cried when it was ove, but it'sfitting for the story. I recommend this to everyone. I

we are to assume are real conditions. There is little in the way of character development in this play, and it is hard to care for or even understand the characters, and their motives are never clear. Even the ending, so often seen as a happy one at the best, is a disaster here, leaving the audience with nothing but a vague sense of something having gone wrong for no reason we can see or understand. The ending is as bad a playwriting as you are ever likely see. I've given you the plot, and now I'll give you my thoughts. There is no reason to see this, except perhaps to learn from it how not to write. I give it an F. You don't wanna know. Go see the latest "Spell" instead. At the very minimum it is entertainiing. The play is an example of bad writing in the extreme, and I don’;t know how the actors kept it together. It's like a bad dream that just doesn;t want to go way at the moment. The worst of the lot is probably the woman who plays the mother of the two boys, who just seems to be doing her own private thing, and then, when she is supposedly dead, still seems to have the ability just sit and talk to her dead son as if there were no one around to hear or be bother by her. If someone were playing her, she should be put under psychiatr
the written material of all its goodness, leaving a shell that resembled nothing. It was a waste of money, time, and talent. The only person in this movie who could act was Dylan Walsh of TV's Numb3ers. Everyone (even Forest Whitaiker) was terrible. It should be noted that this movie is not a comedy, so the funnier scenes are still there, but the film as whole does not deserved to be called a movie. It was a poorly constructed, poor story line, poorly written movie. Not even good special effects can save this one...unless they are CGI effects which make the movie even more silly. This is one of the worst movies of the year, and possibly all-dear, and it is unfortunate to be released during Christmas because it is a waste to all the children that will not understand what is happening on-screen. They would be better off playing with a video-game, and learning how not be so easily entranced by CG images. This movie is one big, horrible, CGI image that I would suggest you avoid. I give it a 0 out 11. (Released October, 2006.) (Released October 5, and opened at No.1. with a gross of about $33 million. The film has made $171 milion world-side.) ... (Read

and we got a chance to see our characters one last time before they got their closure. We didn’t get a big, dramatic wrap-up. We were just treated to the after-thought thoughts of the people involved in this case who were affected by its results in some shape of form or another. We got a gist as opposed to a full-bore wrap up and that was a very good idea. I was a bit hesistant about watching it but I think that was to be expected from the final installment (well that, and some unfortuneted things happening after the film wrapped) and it was a good experience to watch a TV show on the silver and big screen with some very good visuals and audio and that made the experience that more fulfilling. All in a good way. It was well-done. It’ll leave you thinking, though. It might not answer some of your burning question but it will get you some things out there. It is a well-thought and thought-out film. Homicide: The Movie was a good film to watch and an even better film to end the series. I would say that this is one film you should watch and I would say that this is worth at least checking off on a “to-bucket list” of your’n. That is all for this film. It was a worthy series to end on and that is the most important part. That’

Smith) hired by a prison consultatant, Dr Kelley (John Huston), as the welfare officer. There he meets the prisoners and the two who stand out are a young man whose crime involved him being responsible for a fatal accident and another man who was convicted of murdering his whole family, and who is now in solitcary. The prisoners are all undergoing a program of reform, where they learn the importance of education, work-ethic, self-control and team-building in order to become productivi members of a community and not violent members of society. There is a strong feeling of rehability amongst the characters, but the two main characters, Ethan as the councelor and the young man as they learn about what happened that caused his crime, become obsessed with trying the other man. The film is based on the story of a real man and a woman he murdered. The film is about the possibility that we all make our own choices to commit the crime, but that we are not the only reason why they happen. This is a very powerful and moving story, beautifully acted by the actors Lane Smith as the counselor, John Lahr, John Hustan as Ethans father, Robert De Niro as the man who committed the crime and the two women, Diana Ross as the mothers of both men and the young man and the young girl played in a brilliant performance by Kath

a pearl: pigs and babies, pearls and shells are being displayed in windows everywhere. She begins a strange journey to discover what is behind this town' s obcesssion. A girl begins to feel that the things she cares about are not as important to people as they used to seem... and she sets about discoverng why this is. She comes across many characters along this journey and learms many things about life, people and herself. I really liked and enjoyed The Pearl by Nicholas Mosley! I felt like the writing was very descriptve and detailed and it made me feel like the characters where real. I really liked the characterization and the story plot itself. There were a lot a very good symbols that were used throughout the story that I really enjoyed noticng. This book is very enjoyable and a realy nice read that anyone could easily enjoy and read! The story line is unique and the author does very well with his writing and plot. I highly recommened anyone to read The Pearls by Nichoalse Mossley because it is a very good book that I am certain that anyone woul be able to get lost with it and enjoy it very very much!" ~Rebel, age 21, 28/20/21, 2004"My daughter has been reading this book and loving to talk about it!

something made by the mentallly challengeded in a high school home ec class while their teachers had a 30 minute meeting. I don;;t know if it's the horrendously low budget, poor special effects, or simply because the people who made the trailer were on drugs, that made this so god awful. The plot is non existence. The dialog seems to come out of a game of mad-libs, the characters have no motivation and nothing is resolved. The film has no rewatchability. This is the worst film i' have ever had to bear witness too. If you don't believe in torture then watch "Werewolve School: Home for Troubled Teen-Werwolves" because it will put you right over the limit. A 10/01, no doubt. I give it a zero. A big, zero. No rating. NONE. I'm a bit punchy. I'll try and watch it again and update the review if I can get past all the pain, shame, horror, embarassment, anger, disbelif, despair and general feeling of sadness that I felt while watching it.. I may be a while. I'm gona lie down now... and sleep. Good by. (oh, and by watching it I did indeed die. That'd explain why i can';t move my left leg.)
sexually molest you with that long, shiny can of Coppertone sprayed across his shoulders… and a towel that doesn’ t quite cover the lower regions? Or, the gu…, er, the guy with a little extra padding around those love-handle regions? Or, the gu, the uh, the the guy with a little, uhhh… too little hair…? I can go on and on. In fact it might be easier for me to say that I don’ think it possible that the sun tan guy in this photo is gay… I really don’ t think he is. I do wonder though, did he have to have a bikini bottom wardorbe full? That might explain his lack luster performance at the beach. But I am sure it is just a phase, like most other things. Maybe it was an initiation to the local gay beach culture? You know, like “Wel-come my boy! Welcome! You must have the right stuff! You must be ready to be a man! To be gay! Oh, you are? Yes!!!!” Or, maybe he didn’t get the “right-thing” in those beach towl shops… maybe they only carry one color… or, maybe his wife just bought his beach towels from some other place and never checked the gay-ness of her husband…. And so, I am now wondering if
something more from it. I saw the same movie but I was more aware of it and I’ve learned more than one thing from the film: you cannot change the past, it’a better to live in the present and to try and change the things you are able to change and leave the rest the way it was meant to stay. You can’t change your past and I think many people try and fail to do so. I know I’ve been there, tried to change something that I couldn't control and ended hurting both myself but my close friends as I didn't get what was going on in my life. I don’t know what to think when I look back at that time. I think my mistake is in trying too hard to change the things I was not meant for and the things were not meant for. But I think you can change the things you can control and that’ll be a better approach in life and relationships too. It might not work every single time and it’s not a guarantee, but you’ll get something out it at least, and you’ll make it better than before, because you changed it. And I don' t think there'd be another film that made this clear to me than Timeline did. I think the message is so strong that people who haven't watched it (or read a certain book by Michael Crickleton) will be forced to think and question themselves too, after seeing
it was as bad, and worse then a bad porno. I can't believe this film has been made! It made no comment about society, no point was being proved. The actors, even the famous ones were terrible, their lines, their mannerism, their movements were just not belived (they did a terrible English/Italian accent for starters). I think that the producer, and the director have a lot too learn about film. They should not be given a large chunk if money to waste on making these stupid films. The film was so bad that even the opening, and the closing music was annoying, the soundtrack to it made a lot of the scene in it look even more ridiculos then the films itself, and that is saying something... I don'think I will ever understand how anyone can see anything in this film. This is a film I really recommend you watch. But not for the reason you are thinking. This film should not been given the time and money it was spent making it. And for anyone who is thinking about making a film like 'Kill Bill', I hope you are reading, donnot ever think, 'Hmm, let' s do a film like Kill Bill, it was so bad, let'shaven'themovetoaview.' If you've been inspired to do a bad film like that... don not. I do think it's fun when I go out with my
triloogy, this time with a focus on the Roma of Eastern Europe (Romania is the only country that appears), this movie follows the exploits of several gypsi girls who want nothing more but to flee their villages and find themselves a better life in Paris. It's a rather cliched, sophistic'ly photograph, rather sentimental and a bit overlong tale of escape that is made with a lot of love. I don't doubt that this is what you should watch, if you are a fan of the genre (if you know what I mean). It's not as bad as it sounds, though, it really looks and feels good on a big screen. Still I'd advise you to wait for cable or a DVD before going out of your way for it, unless this is exactly a subject you would like to explore further. If that's so, you will most certainly enjoy it a great degree. It is one, in the end, that is more of its genre' than anything. The movie itself can almost pass for an exoticized travelog of the Eastern Europe of today, if you look in between its lines. If that is the case, it may just be that it's worth your money. Just a word: I have the same problems with French cinema as with French food. It's too often made with too many ingredients. The French are really good at using everything there is to
