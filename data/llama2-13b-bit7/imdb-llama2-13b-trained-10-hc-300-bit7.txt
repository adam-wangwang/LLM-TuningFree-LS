. It is rich in emotional baggage, full-fledgged characterizations, and poetic language from all parties. The movie starts with a very sick narrator who is just back in her country after years of working overseas, settle her affairs and moving in to live out. The movie then jumps into the story of how she became the sick and old woman in bed. Those memories move backward from 50 to 27 y.u.o. with 10-year divisions. This way, with the benefit and/her loss--she can recollect a time in the future to say how things are. The voice-over that drives the narrator's story is articulated by the late poet Toni Morrisoney. The movie' s story is told from the perspective a middle-aged woman (she was 35 y..o. when the movie was filmed) who does not recall her childhoo with such clarity and affection that we see when her daughter looks back at her mom' s youth. In fact the daughter finds and asks her about her forgotten time with a man who she had in her late 2Os-early 6Os. She is startles to the news of the romance, and then goes on wondering why she blocked out that time--a large number in the of their life together. We readers watch as the young couple gets together when they are
the cheap makes the fact that they pulled off such a masterpieci all the more astouding! I haven'ta heard so many women go nuts for Chiwetal Ejfoft in a very very ling time...and I mea that in the good sense of the world! You may hear more about this movie then you ever heard if Chiwetall Ejiofor! This is one of them movies where I know it is not the greatest picture which I am watching everyday. But its still better then anything on TV, and has a lot to be said for it! I remember reading that the script for the movie came from 2 highschool girls! And that the two best supporting actresses are actually going through chemthreapy at the moment...for cancer. This is a very moving, very beautiful picture. I tis one which I am sure to add on my list of top ten that is sure to impress! If they can get a little more acting talent like Chilweatal, I am very sure that this will be a great movie! I cant wait for its DVD to hit stores! I am sure to own a number of them! LOL! You will see why! Lions Gate should be pleased with themselves at getting the rights to this! Their money was well spent! Definitely one of the better movie purchases out there! And I am sure that they will probably have the movie making more profit then they would have thought
isn' think about an episode, it is the novel. Writers that have produced other good episodes including "Jericho" and the movie "You Know My name", are the authors for this book, and the book does everything you have come accustumed to, action, humour, thrills, and a whole load about Felix Leitner. This book starts 2000 years before Craig and Brenda, so characters such a Felix have only been hintied in previous work, but this was much more about Felix. Not being a big fan, having seen all of the Cracker episodes, and the novel 3 Times, I was hoping this would deliver. I would really recommend this book to hard core Craig Lovers, people who are fascinated by Felix himself , and of couse people who really want a book with a very interesting story that will keep you smillig for the entirity. If this was out in a soft back format I am not sure I would have gone out and bought it but because it was 5 quid (and almost cheeply produce) I was pleasantly surprised. So if you want action , comedy and a thril, go and grab the book but as for the final comment, that really does depend on the reader. All in All a very good book.

this film and have different opinions on it there is a complete outcry against the visuals. Apart from that no one actually has a problem against the CG stuff I have come across and I wonder why are visual only people having a bone to chew. Because I agree with you if you are disturbed with visuals then you wouldn' t appreciate a character like Chotta Baba. And the critics are trying hard not to give the credit to Mr Bachcha and I think they are being unfavour to him as a kid. As it has been seen that children in some films have done a great praise able job. I feel if it would have been a film for adult people then the critics might had a valid point. With this said I have only 1 comment to make and that is, all these films are made today in this format, so if people don"t like it means that people don' t like the movies that are made now a day. I also think the story was good but it went bad in the climatic part. This film had only 2 krypton- ites. the movie was not about visual it was only about 2 kryptones. The movie was such an average film, that even after 30+ showings the only time I cared to buy the tickt, was because of BIGBABA. I totally agreed, people seem to be disappointed with the lousi
shows attempt to be hip and trendsy with their humor all too frequently nowadia... (more>>>))ys, The Wiz is a show which goes where few are willing to go these (not unlike the lead characters in the Broadway musical)... to the worlds created by the likes of Dick Turgenson, L. Frank Buck and Robert Howard. While some may sneer, I thank them for not dumbing down the show for a 2-4 year old audience, the better to have it remembered when they are 10-12 rather than flushing the whole shebong out the window. This is a special show made for not only the kids who will enjoy it all the same, it is made for all those parents who grew up watching shows back when it was a magick called magic. The show is what we grew up with, now back for a whole new generation to experience. I give them marks, plus my greatest thanks for giving younger generatios the ability to understand and see what these genre' are capable to. Many of my young friends wer eintriged and interested, and all were able after the show to pick up the book a nd read it, too. I am grateful for them for keeping these dreams alive, and still relevent! (July 2021... ) « hide details ... (moreclick here to read the rest) ... (close

best movie, and this one is quite medi…or if you will, bad…and was meant to have multiple sequals. But, that is its basic premise: A mad kung fu master, known for his inhuman abilities, and his gargolyesque faction is set to take over a poor village. A lowlife person is mistaken for the hero who is actually destining to come and help…all in typical kruffy style…a mix between martial arsts, gorilla action, and light…and I do mean light…comedia. It’ s ok, but it sure is nothing notewothey, especially since it was going in for atleast one other movie. The story: Fai (or Dragon) is forced to kill him master in order to save his friends who have been r…MoreWow. This is very atypical in that usually, the best of a lot in a movie is a single movie, or even a pair of movies. But, no, this is a single movie which is supposedly meant as 0ne of many. That is to say that this movie is actually a long chain of many. The main thing about the bad parts of this movie (and there are a few) is actually in that, a single movie was supposed to keep the rest going with what it was trying for at the time of the release, but it was not the plan of
that does The Walking. Dead" and the fact that it'll have "more zombbie action". Not sure why AMC had an issue with the "more kickass" line, even if it is a bit more offensive. FX has some shows, but not many impartial fans watch it. If it wasn'ts for this, we wouldn'tt be going to this. However, for what it is, it has a good cast, a nice setting, and it moves along at good pace, without showing the entire season in the opening episode like its too many contemporaries do these. So, all in all I give the pilot 7 (7 being full marks, subtract 1 point for every negative - the less negative, the higher grade one gives)... I won't be watching it if it'd continue as is. It's still not bad, but nothing is really "catching". However if it adds more, it could be really solid, if not exceptional. It will just need to become more than a "decomposing woman" every other frame fest. This show is worth looking into, but I'm not sure yet what it'll make me. That'll be mostly up to the writers, because from now and on it's all about how it will evolves. If the first was a little predicting... this is about whether it can rise above that... Time to see how good

who is the new "high and powerful" of this group, who is considered to make all the decisions. And since power has become so temptingly worm and the mob members are like modern day rats they would end up to become the greatest hypnotist who knows the word "I love you" very well in order find the next high for themselves. Now this means that the members have to use all dirty and foul methods together in order claim their hearts so that they would be the next one. It can even go to murdering the current "high and almighty." Oh yes, you have this guiltily pleasure all of the time. And the ending is no different. After one of the mob members has been wounded by his own brother (who staged a new bomb at the stage during the ceremony to his brother) is arrested. As everything falls apart in a mess, one can only say that its all just another day at the triads. Enjoyed! But in a very low lighted cinema. I almost thought I went to view V for Vendetta all of my night. Sigh, I love this land of hong kongs and mob dramas, they love blood and they love you all the time with action flick.

but Brown has its merit as an early lookback, as a look forward, and as the rare depiction of intellectual life – the life many assume those who enter the ivvy gates are conscripting in. We even get a nice study of a middlebrow married man, one who has traditions but not strong convicts, and he's forced to re-evaluate his worldview the moment it is inextricablle linked to the value of $300. The results of his discovery, Brown insists – with some satisfaction, I'd say – are inevitably radical, but his first impulse is to try, uncomfortablly yet genuienely to keep things in place. To hold, as Brown would say in the vernaculat he so often emplys, to a new consensus. His is a valiant effort and one I think many of us probably like even more in retailsope, now that the consequences of trying that in the real world are so very grimm, so very much at hand, and can – for some of you – never be as far away as you might otherwise believe. The middleclass will need to step up again, I feel, and Brown insists, and I couldn' t agree more. If you're looking at the movie, as you should, from the historical perspective, it does make for a very satisfying piece of filmmaking. No
Year Eve moviegoo movies. It is from the hey day, and a real gem in the lineup of "New Year's Evie'". I believe it was directed by Otto preminger in his last Directorial effort. This is also important film, because Lilly Palmer returns from a world tour, and meets with the other cast members. This film is a delight, along his side of the spectrum, as this venerable entertainment genius makes his filming efforts as entertainers, and behind scenes activity work as a film director. This is no "New Year Romance"... for here we have an original production by Otto, who knew what he had to work inside the studio, but, has the necessary talent needed to put it on the big show, and have it on the big show. It'a sad, that the people who enjoy the classics, don't get to experience this gem of a film. The acting in this film, has a familiar lineup of characters, which makes it highly entertainment, as every one, will have a new play on their hands, and delight, as soon, as the screen comes on! It's a fun film. It is the final film made by Otto, and was probably a very difficult time for Otto to be making his own film. And yet he went ahead and was a force to be reckoned with, and made a great film all along the line from
thought it was a great movie with a reflexive focus on the actors/acting and definitely a very appropriate theme for this reality TV based production. The plot is pretty straightforward. A group young actors are competiting to being cast for lead roles of a up and coming movie about female footballers. These young thesbians live and breth in an actors' hostels which is used to house and teach these up and comners. It sounds like the up the creek, down the streaming (aka The Full Monte) in South America, is the hostels for those who are serious and not there by chance, or for any commercial gain, but pure love of acting skills The only thing stopping them is their total, absolute and complete lack... (full context) 2. Who is the target market for such a message This is movie for a fairly broad target market including predominant yuonger, educated audience, who like and enjoy both watching movies and may have ambition to star in them. This movie also has a great opportunity for cross over appeal because of the great sport thme and its resonance with young male audience, and its interesting themes throghout. This movie should be considered for a fairy broad distribution and promo across channels. 3..... (full context)...on our lives. This is not just a movie it is a life changer. 4.

made because I didn't think I would be seeing such topical gems in Fraggle Rock. But yes, these were made in 90-93 and address the Gulf Crisq the first year (not really a crisis is my point, but they still deemed it one) - a war on Iraq. That the muppet producorrs had the courage to discuss the issue is great but not so much that they played it for laughz and it's pretty much a repeat of both The Muppets Go Hollywood and the US vs UK episode of AtISS. At their heart, Muppets rock, but not when you've got too narrow of a vision of what they can do, which really was the case for the most part in the late '8os and early 9os. These episodes are so close in time to the 70s, both in design and character that you have to look at the Muppets from a purely character stand point rather than which hand is pulling the strings. Frank in particular for someone like me who hadn Giles, could be a nice little substitute if I had been watching his show in the late '80. He was really fun to see in the show, but in the end it came down to the fact that this Mupper was about something bigger than any individual puppeter. I hadnâ&#x80;ve never really watched Fooling about til recently and
how that one day poverts will rise and murder the evil rich people who deserve to be murdered and how they are just as bad or worse than any mass murderer Hitler/ Mussorlini/ Hitler/Stalin because they own so much more evil wealth than them ↑ 1.093… 2. 865… 3. 58700000 and that nobody is so evil as to own more than 5.88000…6. 211 million, no? Oh hold your hearts and don't ask yourselves, who do you know who own more than 21… 315… 1016 million in wealth and who do they really own it? And yet how do thousands of poor people in the UK who can' say he is a bigger mass murder than 4-5 years of deaths by illness and pover-faminesetinment? And what about the hundreds and thousands of other people who are the real source of deaths of these people and how they hide their wealth in tax havens? And as a moral boost: When a system collaspes, who dies for the system and who for their own and/or others survival? And yet when a system collapsing because of people who haven't enough food, how do I know it's because of the system they were stupid to keep
movie. I guess you should judge every movie on a level, as to it's intentions. Take a HARVEY or a SPEED for example... they were made as light comdey fare. I suppose BLACK WIDOWS should have been made on that level as well... or atleast, made as a straight-forward horror. So I must give it some credit for atleast trying to be a film noire thriler in the veingance of an old DRESSER BRIDGE horror from the '60's and just fuckin' up, plainly. It makes no damned kind'a sense, except in it's general layout. You just gotta turn off certain parts of your brain and, after awhile you're there, in the zone, so to say, where things do, indeed, make 'some kinda' of sick sense, kinda... even thoe the events are completely impersonal and actually, down right confusing. You're never sure who you're supposed to "like" in this movie. The best performance here is by Debra Jo Farre, the only one who clearly "gets" what a sleazebucket she's living through... and I loved the fact she went on that talk show circuit, not once but, twice. That's the kind of balls that gets'em respect. This is also the
to tears because of the thought provoking lines of the lead character, Joe. Through its entire 2 hr and 30 minutes of running length i found this movie, 'He's just (Not that into you) too irresistebale' highly entertaining. I think it's one such movie that should break the 'we-don’ forget' -'we don' get along' , 'fight always' and 'never trust a woman' generalizations that the male race love to bring in and put me in, everyday. This is not the first film where i found ben affected by Rachelle (reminder- ben affeck is the guinea in my ben 2 her 10 equation) but this was the film that i found him being the most passionate about. I admitedly liked his passion. Although i harrdly know any of them in person, i could visualise their charm that got me smilning often, although i laughed alomost a dozen times, being the cynic that i am. All the same i thank the filmmakres for offering me the luxurious opportunity. The movie in itself is about how our thoughts influence all our relationshhips, be with the person u love or hate. I also strongly think that the movie is an open attempt in explaining to the male race, how the 'girl of one’s dreams often turns out being
are all good, as Odyssean heroes should be. A bit disappointing as in the early going the script offers up some wonderfully abssurd moments, like how the Odessa of the title would have a huge statue of the Colossos up in her downtrodown district. As well as a statue to Horatio Alger, which was pulled down by a group in 1776. The director and star work overtime in the film's last half for some kind to redeeming and excruitiating oddities (a visit from the Head of the IMDB, a holographic image of the Odyssean hero himself, and a series on surreally slapstick brawls) to the point that they do successfully deflect attempts at analysis of just how well-concecueted or well-realised this is. It's no real masterpeice or anything...but it is fun, and fun is a rarely heard word in most of the cinema today...so here it'll do. More so than not.

contrast today's moviemakers and scriptwrites come at children as if they are flies, thinking that if something is oblique or obscure enough, young people will pay attention. And they are no less patronizing to adult viewers. They seem not to understand that people want to pay, even if they don’t relish spending a lot of time watching ads for pop corn and sodies. Unfortunately we have to watch these before we get the latest R-rings just to make them happy with their time machine so our cage is almost invariable let out before we can watch the feature. We have to put up this “experience” just to avoid watching the commercits, so as soonest we can we look for a break in the action to stretch and exercise our arms. It’s a problem trying not to hit my fellow movie goers with my flailing limps- I have to be real care free to avoid this. And this is just what Disney does to us! So when you pay to eat soggied fries with stale yellow pop corn just so children can see how to behave in space, you are as foolish as those “Star Wars” franchises have evolved to become. They have the advantage that you won‘t hate them less as the series extends- that is so true as with “The Chronicskles”. You may like them less, but they still are a more satisfying
this movie. Does it mean they are scraping it and calling it a day !! It said the movie is expected to be completed for release on February 14, 2k15. Do you know if it still happening ??????? What about Dani and Jamie .... the chemisty was great ... why are thy ending it ?? I was so looking foward to it .... I love the serie .... and I love the writers. They did away a great ending with season 2. Please do not scrap it . Please. I am truly broken. Loved the books ... I am true fan. But the serie is better. I read they are going with the third one ... but please do season three. The book ... to me is not even close. Season two is so much more better. Please please please make season 3 .... do like the series..... I know they have to do ... movie but .... please season three.... I promise if it comes out before Christmas ... the box-office will make up . After all your fans have made you filthy rioch .... from season 2. Loved it !!!!!!!! Will miss. The characters and my family and me will miss you dearle !! Please please ..... do not scarp season 2 or scram for the movie.... give it time .... be patient .... even I was patient with series.... and my family and I loves the series .... we have season dv
of crap under 2 1/2 at the very, very least are on this site for something different than what this movie delivered... and if anyone here is really a female who does like this movie, please stop watching/collecting horror and take your little horror girlishness to the shores in New Jersey (Casper and Ghostville) and look for scary ghost parks there...this was awful!!! the ghost chase scenes were laughably bad....even the lighted glow balls on a string that they sold at Walgreens 2 years ago were scarier and on a much better trail. Any female ghost movie freak needs to get out from behind the computer and actually really physically get involved with a movie. No female director could have done this gag worse...there was NOT ONCE A CHANCE they were actually lost, that'd the only logical explanation...this movie was so stupid and babystep, it was like a little girl who actually thought of it, I know, the thought never had an opinion until a girl had it, but I am sure she came across a movie, not exactly this one, where just a breeze scaring some kids sent them all crawl and hide in the house...and then while there, some female gust, er..spirit said "come on girls" and they ran to the basements and hid behind cork boards, well thats

If only they had a man with a stick……….PLEASE, STICK A STICK IN THAT STORY, SAVE THESE POOR TALENTLESS EQUOES! You can't blame the horses, they werent given alot……anything….to work with (except they probably will blame that too). Save the horses and kill that awful script……I'd hang the writer for wast of time! Who was thinking at all these days? What is that horse doing with a 357 revolvor? (Never heard about a horse pulling out an A.K-2….in fact, I know i've never known a story like with a horse with full on assault rifles) That thing with the eagle, that was done so badly that I even wonder if the writers have even heard about the story they just did. UGH! I guess I should'nt be saying these things about such a "profesional film"……I thought it looked kind of interesting juding off the "trailers" ….but then again….so were the HONEST TAMERA ANN COLE MOVES...in the 7

film. if it didn’ be for the title i would of never guess it as an alien love adventure. the title and the overall style of seth green' moments makes it impossible to take seriously. it's an amazing story of love as only old souledge can provide, and one that anyone whether or i'm not too sure. this was a sweet and heart warming love story about two teenagers from different world who meet and begin a long distance relationship. the are some serious comedic moments throughout i'm so sure that this is a film not to missing. the comedic elements werent that funny and the dramtics felt forced. the story of first love and falling in true love but with some funny moments. it’s a very good film, and it’s funny that he is, after all, is still human at heart. if you don like the film there a great deal about how funny and not important things are when it all comes together in the end and the two are so different from one another. it' done very well with very well with all his quir in the romantic comedy genre and it does extremely well what it gets right with a very enjoy. i really like when a film really does that, as long with the film. the two are completely disconnected and the story unfolds over is great and the young actors do a great job of it' a very funny and heart
horribly unskillfull, the plot is really dificuilt, not to speak about the horror effects... It's a disaster.. Therefor, i recommend this film with my highest honor to all die hard horror fans.. Because if you don´t put this piece of s**th in your collection you won't be able to recognize s**t in decent films. The best thing you can do, is watch it with lots and LUOTs other friends....or take a sleep-pill..!!!!!!!!. Belive it or not, it'll still be great entertainers!! Or take a sleep-pil......;-)...this movie also made me a big T& A fan!!!!!....lol!..I give this piece of *** two stars(!) out five (**) (due my generocity!) because i heard that the film-maker have now managed a new and "greatrr!" sequel of H2O.

sense-enhanched trailer fails to give you a single clue about what the plot is; I guess all we can be grateful is that the trailer didn' t even feature a single frame of footage from 'DREAM' , it only featured scenes from other movies. <a href="http://img4.imagelocation.com/bspap/C13/4274813MG56N93923.jpg"><img border=0 height="205" alt=DREAMLORDS-C-3po-scooby&3787" src="Image001.gif", width="552"></img></a><a target=_bspa></font><center><a href='[size="1"color=N][b]' title='<font color=red size"2">YOU'RE PLAYIN' LIKE USELESS OLD TURTLES</a></font></center></font'>[/b][1][/size]<a href="/list.html#">[size="3"color=N][b]</font></font><font color="" family="Ariel,Comic,Helv" size="3">[sup] © 2/1/02 "Dreamworld" I was, alright?

film five times... I give credits to writers who at least are able to finish a sentence, let alone 86 minutes of material that you felt so compelled about you decided it was not made for someone such as myself... Well let'z tak' a look, shall we? First, I honest think you expected a bit too from this film. Maybe I expected to much, but I expected at LEAST the movie I felt the synopsis promised me and the director wanted me to believe the trailor.... Basically... I thought we were getting an Alien rip off, and a GREAT one too. Instead, I get a very very V.V.V. dispointing. Now, let'sz try to put my 2 cen'ts worth on this movie... I felt so disheartened that I went back to Rental Movie Heaven (RMH) and picked up the 10 dollar rated, 1997 realeaese of "Starship Trooper." Now that I am comparing them, these two film have very little in common really, save both are space set and have a similar title, the concept, and they are a warfilm. No, no, please do not write me to complain. Hell... I had to go out of my way to find ST but then again so did, so did you, so did we all.... let's face it... this is the dam
any sense. You will want to see if just so someone can pick it out of your mind and analyze what you just saw. This movie contains a series of sketches designed to show the randomness of life, and how little we humans actually understand… or the random nature of things. Everyone, in their daily lives make certain decisons that, at times are based off of their own free choice and at other are based off their randomness. That's what the story of this film is about. It'll keep playing in the background in the backs on the audience's minds in a way, while the audience sifts tru what to look out or in what is actually happening. The entire movie is a random pattern, not unlike the human brain. Which is why I say it would cause havoc amongst cineatiesque circles in Paris, after about the Third or fourth screen of it. I love the idea behind it, I have no problem with the production quality, but there is a lack of story, plot, theme, story arc and what have you, the elements that I consider a movie. So if that'll be a positive or negative factor in it depends soley in the person in question, who I don´t mind discussions on. Very much liked for my taste, but the lack of movie elements made it difficult to enjoy as so, as I normally enjoy a movie. But despite it, I recommend for the cineaties
an intellectual treat. Except it isn't. There seems little reason why a movie set almost wholly at the edge, at some point along the whole vast landscape between earthly reason (or, at any case, human reason) that is the mind' and utter nothingness' that if found is at best a singularity of infinite destruction' or is it creation?' had to be a cerebral chess exercise with ghosts. It could have been a far more enjoy... read the rest of this review on the Filmcrack website here: www . filmcracl.net/2 48004-03 651 1.34.html/... It begins with two disgusting comic gags, yet very soon it uncovers its genuin wordsmith desire s. Except it never makes it anything but, rather obviously, a game of mental checker s between the unknowable aby ss that separates human mind and uny ie lingual, unidentify able "not life". Why set a film along the edges, upon that broad vast land between meaning, which can hardly, at worse, be a void s, and, best, an individual singularit y fo r which unlimited oblivion is either the only conclus ion or, possib ly racy, the one moment of universal beginning's or is it a vacuum's?

also does not have an interesting turn of story. We don’t really understand why Mini is dejected about her new car, nor do any specific things happen next. Her dad who was not caring about the car is suddenly very interested in it, and then he gets trafficked into a dacoit’ smuggled car by the police officer (?) Santhosh! Santhosh sends Sanjeev to find his friend and rescue him, who in turn see’ Mini once, and falls in love. Yes that’ s actually the way the movie begins, and goes on. I suspect half the movie was dedicated to Mammooty’ s make-over. I’ m sure Sanjeevi would have loved this one, and I sure would have, for that matter! It would be funnier if you watch with that kinda mindset, with a bucket near your seat J. The songs where Mammootty dances, were awesome. If you want to see a movie with a story that can be summarized as a few lines in no more than quarter an hr, go for Gajarajan Guruvyan. You will laugh hard and long. As for me, I would want to watch this in my home VCD format, than at the movie theatre!! (If you have to say why, ask me when I am in mood…) J. This is a good one time-pass
- that clowny guy from the WETTENSHAUSEN AUSTRIA commercial. I like him a lot. But I'm not too big a movie fan, so I usually forget the names... Anyhow... the movie was good, I had a quick laugh or too. I like the girl, too, and the chemestry between the two of them. Paul looked good, too, at his early twinties. The sound were quite bad, but the plot was good, and that alone justifed watching the movie. It reminded alot a certain movie named "The Money Pit" which stares Tom Hanks and Shelley Long (yeah.. the former Charlie from TOWN & COUNTY). I actually preferred this way better than "The Foursome." Heck.. maybe I should borrow it from the library and have a second look at this movie - just to see how I would rate that as being a movie. Yeah yeah... I know I've become a movie fan... but that doesn'' be the case, I only watch 2 or three a dew at max and that's all... so it doesn matter. 7/10? Nah why not.. 7,5 for a quick laugh. ;) :) Hey! I know this isn going to be a very informative review.. just want some time out after that heavy GIT semester! :) So see
) had for the 'adult only rated' film (1983) which is still available on DVD ...but I've lost the will to get involved with 'older' film subjects for the online class (they always disappear before the deadline). Also there is a tsunamilike ruling on 'banned' films, the Japanese one 'Tora!' for example which is the most often stolen film item online. Finally I'll mention 'The Holy Mountain', a film with a lot of symbolic references in real life. It's the filmmaker which gave us the film and it'd be surprising to note he was in some sense banned from direct contact with the public since the film' official launch some years back... yet they still have a huge following. Let's just not forget we are living in an age where censorships come mainly in shape of (intrusively) self promoting online communities. Yes it even bores me! That and the unpleasant, uncaringly ignorant users of the world, especially among the 'you'ns. 20 pages of 'I ain't too 'appy with the last one' (I'll try to add the link or maybe you'll find the time to put it in your favourities and hope it' ll be online for ever as some forums (like here) will probably run their course before the people whose posts I need

...but I'll share it anyway! This was a "childhood movie", believe me...that was how we found "new" movues. It wasn’t always easy, where we lived in the early to mid-’8o's. KTV/Sat TV was "on the way" but cable wasn`t available in the rural area we lived. The only thing we could get on our small TV was the local CB network, channels 2 - 19. We had a V.E.C in our basement that could pick up a rotating dish when we werent down that we would watch our news on when there wernt to many technical difficulties. We had a few tapes we would wear OUT! But who cud we learn to hate? The main subject of today: A film that was released in 85 and quickly fell into obscurtity. WHICKING POINT! Why? ...there was an advert for the 25 th anniv. just yesterday and I thought: "oh no, I got to share that..." Yeah, well have at it....And lets just assume you can get this one...or at least be a little "culturaly" cluvierrific.... Liking "80`s" type movues isnt mandetary. Theres no age range on this group...just a "share" of movue (or in
ed for people of all kinds, since it has about four stories that come together under this premis (literally translated as “Grapefruits”) of a group of friends who find out they have been bettrayed from one of the own (a friend – although at the beginning is not really clear- or a girl they both pretend to be in love, who knows with whom). What starts like an American and even British comedy about friendship (just like the one the actors did for their American dream: a baseball film, Fever Pich.) becomes the standard Spanish comedy with a little action going on every five minutes, or at the end when you wanted the film was actually going. It is always a sad thing to see how the people who trusted in their first film and have little experience jump directly into something else. They haven‘t got their feet on the ground yet (see also the films El laberint d’espases), and might believe they are going to make it big. Well, in the future Alatriste might be a help, but this kind in a series of films (La comunitat) is not. Unless they like to go one about doing a certain kind, then there is no problem trying and experimenting what will work and also what will not. The best thing is simply be patient and start doing films by one by one, and when one will be a hit everything will be much easier and it will feel like
CGIS assigned to his case because he has no faith in the force and has no desire to work with his partner. The CGIS assigned to the DCPD though is Sam B. Walker (Gene Wilder) and he brings his own interesting background to his job in keeping order on those three blocks of Gee Street, the worst slum and crime center in the city, that they plan to clean up. Eventually Sam has Dutch become his partner and between them and some other oddbods, they just clean the area up and make life unsafe and interesting. When the movie ends on a shot of the district a graffiti artist with his "Rats" spray painted near the names Jaws, Snatch and Mo, Sam and "Mellow" Marmaadu (Richie Andava), "Dutch" gets one more chance trolls the streets to catch the "Rat". Wounded, Dutch tumbles in front of a car he turns out not too badly and the tagger on a motorcycle barells away from the scene just as Dutch is asking the cop that stopped the car why he has "stupid written over his bads" on his car? Even though the movie may be a bit of a let-down, the laughs are pretty generly placed and pretty often. The movie has a terriffic look to the location and the action is quite good.

reasons of the main characters. The acting was awful by Tom Hank and Jacki W. was horrible. I've read many reviews calling this "racisit" i disagree but i understand where that comes from with a Black Jackie Robinson playing a White person. Overall nothing good to say except maybe the actual baseball parts were ok. I don' t think i would recommend it to anyone. Poop. This was disappointing. Hugely uncomforable. I read the book....then i rented the movie. I thought maybe the book was hard, and that'z why they had changed it soo much.....i do believe that "Race's" best chance in some aferican amercian boys (it's their heritage) will come when The Next Great White Baseball Leggend is named N'Synge or something. So that movie and book will become as boring as any other book/film. I havent had a good book in a year.....the book industry is just as stale (IMO) and formula'd as the film industry. Maybe just as frustrated in the end....after reading this review, i must take the bad advice and the n'dout.

LOTR characters. Now these are fictitial beeing and may the gods watch the soulsof the author :) I may be wrong but there it goes. A good writer can make you dream and feel like as a living part in the story and this book holds that spirit. To be honest though I haven't read the last three books, but I hope to finish that. The story is great, with several dimensions, I think they have captured a lot of the spiritual level of the witcher 3 very well, although I am not completly sure that this is a good thing :). The story plays around Gerlat's personall life from two sides; how to live with one son hight up in the north and the other is far away somewhere else; on the road as a "Monster slaying witcher or father" (all dependet of the angle you look at). To be human. And how he himself will be treatened by the past. There are many twists and turns. And the storyline develop very well. I even felt my heart beating a little with the speed when he travels. And almost weep when everything seemed to be thrown out of the window and the light of living faded out for him again. I myself use my head to much when reading a book so I rarely feel like with the story. But in these books I do, so I know that the author has done her
looked like a kind've tacky, light film. Bros-Man and I have an unending interest in World Wars, so had to give it whirl, and I'm so so very happy that I'll did. If you put all the bad press aside, ignore it, and you too could love this film as I have! Sure there were a few corny lines, but the plot was well thought… out and of good quality. As with most B-movies, especially war films one has doubts as it unfolds about how it could actually have some merit. But Bros-Mon and this one proved to me that Brosna would not bore, and the film was well worth my time. It was action packed, had great sets, costuming, and the best part, showed actual British and French troops at the time. They looked exactly like they should. The film accurately captured the feel, uniforming, and war machines etc, of the time period. Any war movie fan would appreciate this one. What's best, I found nothing in this film bored me in the slightest. It kept moving along the way a good war epics do but I didn't mind because all the twists' and turns came as surprises to me and I hadn’t seen the end before it happened. High Recommends all the war buff Bros-Fana to go and see this film! It

' has done there, the police take away everything he has got left, including the overalls, belonging, as they later learn, to a man who died in prison. Uspentov is so angry about his overals that he kidnapps a rich young woman, who, he thinks is the wardrobe mistress at the prison where he was bust. But it turns out she is the daughter of a publishers, and so Uspentov and a few other excons take over her father publishing co;, and start publishing pulpltion sex novellas as high art. They also concoct other scams and trick as along as possible. This is a literay scam, but Uspintlov does an excellent job with it. There is some very funny situations and the scenarust, Charles Bracket, keeps it hootsing along. The llysifoertion and cinematography are real good. This is probably the best film Bracket ever wrote. There is an excellent cast here too with Herbert Linkor, Gina Pinyoliand Danny Menkin. You can't go worng with "The Wayward Girls. This movie might not win many Academy Award, but what the hell. This is one of the finest modern screwball (?) films I've even laid eyes on. The performances, the story and the humour (though rarely Laughing-At
it makes the audience think you're going to do all of the classic scenes of the original. You never do, which was a shame because they never happen and are not in here. Hicks and Alyson are great but the script is weak and the ghosts are far from scaring. It's silly. A re-do of a movie about doing the wrong thing with bad consequences seems to miss it in the reductive attempt at a moral lesson about gifts (which seem pretty clearly not a good way in to eternal damnation). That theme rejection is silly, though I admit I love ghost stories. It'd have been better doing some original story with the house but it appears the original story was never ever meant to end like that. So, short of that and with out the original scream scenes (also a big mistake I think) it' the same film, but not really as good. Worth seeing only if a fan, really there's no need as a new one. If you want to show someone the movie, give em T3 and a 1. This is a remake you really need to avoid (but I'd give it a 3.5/4). It is a rather dumb movie that is unnecessary. Really, I'd suggest just using this idea again, that should work....... I wish I'll admit that had Hicks and Aliyah tried a
this should surely become iconic cinema. However, this is one of those films that you wish you had given up before the last reeler just so as not ever to even replay the last 20 m's in the cinema, never mind 3 hours of my own life. There are no surprsing twist or turns of the plot that can fool even a child to guess before the reel change. The three leads are not beliveble as the cops on their trail. There is a certain self conciousness about the 'futurism'. The whole film seems to want to fit into an 'American' culture type of film. Why do all the criminals have to have a British accent as well as, of course, American? Why are there so many 'black' gangsters but the cops, other gangsters and 'good' people look, dress, walk and talk very, very American? Well, to tell the truth, it doesn' work for me at all and even in the cinema, just when things were really going to get worse for the heroes I was beggining for them just disappear so as to avoid all that unpleasantness that was loooongly to come. The music that accompanied the first reel is better at the end. If you are 'down' this is not a movie to lift you, even for a while ....... better not watch it at 'all. Just take my word
told in the most unrealistic and contemptuous way possible. It'd have made more sense to just write down a story outline. Perhaps the movie has too much violence against women for me to take it seriously, but I had to shake my bloom once again at the pointless and gratuitous murder of a female supporting character in full view of her daughter, as done for laughes. I donÂ´t watch screw-you-trivial-humor very well. I want to re-iterate good special effects, some nice art, excellent casting, and maybe this as as a storyline for something else, but if this was supposed to entertain, I think it failed. It was about too nasty and sophisticated to really be silly enough for fun, but the characters don't have the depth to be too interesting or sympathetic. I'm thinking about the original King Kong or The Day The Planet Cried over this: It might have actually worked better as an animation, less expensive to film and no loss of content. The best part of the movie is the score--it's really great and is worth purchaging for anyone who likers this sort. Reposted/transferred to Video L/S/G because I originally made it in film studies and I meant it to go with the other video reviews, but it's going to fit best with the sci-mov/computer art groups,
and writers aren` t big movie buff themselves by the way they depicted real life serial killiers and it pissed me right of! The person I am talking I about is Charles Mangeson who in the movie is portraied by Tomas Jane! Like I stated before I know quite a few things on some of serial kiillers and even the people who hunt for serial killiers. In this blog I will be talking of the real Charles Mansons crudness and my thought and of people close with Mansons for an inside scope of what really happened. I myself thought I would be doing something small for the person who was murdered by Mansons blood brother Bruce Davis! I thought I wouldn;t be a problem sine Mansons victim was no longer with is and only a photo of the woman on some of the different websites! I was just going do it all in all! Well I first learned about Bruce Davis, who is a convietkd killer who had killed a woman name Sheila, after the director and writers had not known about he person. But I knew who he was and the story behind him. I found out on different website what he had looked like and what his victim looked like. Unfortunately I was unable to use either of the pictures because of the person who was created for the person who was actually Bruce Daviss victim! It was so distrubing that Hollywood hadn`s the guts to draw the person

Les Cent Mille Marchés. The main street, the Champs-Elysees, is a road and an underpass, and vehicles and pedestrians cross paths, with the fume lines of bus exhaust to illustrate exactly where the air pockets lie. One of Claire’s team lives in a glass cube, high on the side of a skyscape where her aunt and a man can be seen in silhouette against the lights. It’ll all have to be cleaned eventually. Below and on either side, a monorail system for the less fume sensitive, high-speed trains and automated minicabs. People disappear into buildings and come out in new places. The RER is part of an underland railway system, as is the Metro and the Tuk-Too services. The Arc de Trimph is a giant green manhole, but, somehow the Avenue de De Gaulle, made of grey marbled tiles in a wavy pattern remains. This new Paris, without the blemisss, the crevasses shows off the beauty of the old place. The old shops and buildings just fit in like pieces in one of those three-dimensional puzzles: the HK shopping center is still a cinema, and the Louve is … a public bathroom, but the rest is untouched, the busts and statures unchanged: Robespyre,
Chekhov story and some episodes out of an untitled Italian comedy. In the former, Alice Spivakov (Andrea Anders -- best seen on "Joan Of Arçadia" and the soon- to-be cancelled "Less Thn 30") plays an aging, unmotivated, self indulgently spoilt child. She lives in LA, still at her family' s house. For the better part of two decadrs, she's earned a living solely as an accomplice to her father (Robert Proski, good) in a series grifts and heisted art projects, and she' ll do this until the day she dies. Her parents are pushing her toward "settling down"; she' s not interested. She wants another partner in crime. In spite- of her mother's (Carla Gallo's Lizzy) protestations about family heredity, all seems hopeful until the day Alice is arrested in a traffic stop but man- aged to get out and into a police car. Once hailing from the Eastern European country of Grzhedina, which until only a short while ago was run as a dictoriship (when life was easier for Alice and her parents), it' s unlikely this mug shot wil be out of print for a long time.. So Alice is ordered to take on a community project. Wandering about Ven' da
better tribute than what Farrelley and Wessler have delivered for The Farce. Aside the fact that, on occasions their misfires manage to elicit a laugh, there is unfortunately so much the film did wrong, it becomes incredibely difficult by the end to recall a single line, or event, that actually made the entire exercise worth watching in retaliation. And that is where the mistake in choosing to do the Stooge' top short moviess lies on their part. See, you may have remade (and managed respectably so, from a comedy point of view) a Pink Panther heir, or a Steve Martin original. But whereas they were well appreciated pieces which still have their devotae today (as well an audience the average comedians of today can bare compare to...), shorts (let alone short films!) just aren’... don' have it. And when your stooges are forced, awkward one-note characters as a concept, such an enterprising endeavour becomes an incoherent mess of meaningless random stings. It also doesn’t work as an ode to old, which, by all meaning today, was far, far better than what this mess of a lame fart has to pass as a stoopid idea! I couldn’t even comment on how incompotent the ‘acting’ was or who did what (I’d
comments. The description describes how the armor and weapons of the individual types of warriors corresponded to the individual animals. However, there was not one armor and a weapon for the different types of troops, there was a different armor, helmuts (kabutas), shield (tatesutagi), and arcs (yumizahayas) for each formation. Moreover the three formations (cavalerie on horseback and foot soldiers, infantry with bows and arrows, arches, spear and arrows, arrows and all equipped in the same way) did never charge at once, as described here. The charges were always done in the same order. Thus the cavalrie charged with the arcs and arrowed and when these had done their job infantery with sower shield and spear followed that, and finally the archers. This is partly explained by strategy on how at first you attack and demorale the enemy with arros and then get closer to fight him with arrows, spear, etc., besides, the same troops with arrows did not join the enemy formation. Anyway the troops charged always one after another. It became so easy to defend yourself with this system, as it guaranteed that when you shot yumiza-hayau against the enemy, someone will take the arrow out of your hand. This system got so common that it was not until 1867
the time, and was thrilled to recently discover this beautiful SEVERLY LOW BUDDget short is available online. I especially love the music from local band The Laugavegures. Watching it now with the knowledge that the film's lead actor would go on some years later to be one Bruce Springstreen was interesting. I'd be curious to hear from anyone from the Garden State who might have been around to witness Bruce as he appeared locally in his very early teens, particularly in the context of this strange, haunting short: here. Of course, there's plenty of Bruce on screen (some very fine performances in great films), and you can see lots of his music videos on YouTube or Netflixs excellent Bruce Springstein Concert Films collection, here. At least (in my opinion anyway) it shows all Bruce is as an artist, and serves as a great introduction to a performer who's worked hard at his craft, and understand first hand the world his music describes ... and of all the media available anywhere on the big man - that toothless but wise and beautiful face of the poet working ever night on the road against all the odds - this dark, dark, film from his youth seems to me the most potent of my knowledge - at least the most potent about the mystery, and great sadnes, of this (un)usal world. Maybe it'll speak to those of you
in Albania on 16m of film, we follow a young group of Americans on a ski holiday. It all starts off harpy enough, only to take… More An Insommniac film, there's no question about that. This is a case of pure insomnian, both for the characters in this film, and for the public. And this is not something negative, it comes as a relief. This may seem hard, for those who love his films like a drug and who are addiction preneurs because of that. But, that too is only a positive thing, as it proves that this director, his films too, are unique, that there are not many who offers you this uncut, non-normal, in-alien concept of film. I have seen a few things, I have made an effort to do that. It seems a lot of it paid out, as I can say I managed to see a few of his films. Now I know what those fans go through, this is exciting. They believe this story to be worth, more importantly, to be something alive. To be worth our precious experience. <hr> <b><i>'Paris Texas', 1985</h2> As a child in 1992, 'wheelchairian of love in hell' was my way into cinema. I spent years going through the director’s works,
will certainly not be the cue for an uplificon, but it’s a decent-enough movie to have seen. I didn’t see it with any great expectations, and the film delievers most of the things I am used too expect about this somewhat ecclectic genre: some good stunts and action, some bad acting, some mediatic gimmicks, some gorgeously sexy French women. And no dancing carrots, fortunamentaly. Rancillis aluminum keeps things simple, but this is also its greatest flaw. Basically, if Tom Cruis could go to Top Gun without much effort, I could also enjoy Rambaldia Aluminum. (read the full review) (C) 5-24 15 min. (The 16th Bamburi Film Festival) As usual, the organization was exemplarry, and the movie was not bad either. I was quite impressed by some elements of the film, especially from an editorial standpoint—I think the selection and order were really great.. The main complains about the film have to do more with its content than anything. Overacted, and with a feeling of being a tv movie. And of course the fact tha it stars a certain Ms. Jolle, whom most of us have seen quite a bit too much of, as the same type of character she’
his anti democratic policies. Many of the workers in the Soviet Bloc including Hungariasz workers were made to feel that they are free! It was in this year, Khruschev decided to withdraw soviet troops from Budapest that many Hungariant workers began protests and civil disobedience. This led the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates into a political debate on the role of Communism in the FreeWorld. In response to this, the United States embassies in Eastern Eruop began to offer educational programs to Hungary for Hungariants. The Soviun Union had a meeting and agreed once more to stay in Budapest. Khruschov declared martialL aw in Hunghary and the country remained at war until November, when the URounit discreationg forces had moved out. In hhe Spring of 1 956 some Hunghary workers began a protest which were met with police fired and the Hunghary Government had declared martial law after 844 death, 20,000 inujred , and 20,600 arrests. Today the Hunghary Revolution is labeled as a disaster by the United states leaders. In April 11, 2006 Hunghary celebrates the fty year anniverary of the revolution. The Hunghry Revoltion began in 20, 1 e when Hung
and on YouTube, I loved the banana scene, the sketches, etc. So that would have been a dream come to a see a BOTTOM episode before any of them did! Laugh was the best track off of the latest album, and so right up my ally. The video is brilliants, all three of them look brilliant especially Rik Mayall, who looks like the fatherly figure, the more mature out of the whole group. I am a huge Rastamon and Digger Dahn't fan. On top if all that the song was just bloody weird, as it is supposed too be. I think this is what killed the band off, as no-one could really understand it, I didn;s blaming them, and with this song was a little bit different from their previous stuff. My favourte part is the end, when the three them jump into the sea, blokes in suits jump in to save them, and then they realise they cannot swimm, so they jump in. So then the aliens come and resque them! It is ridiculous, but I love the song so fould love too hear more music from the band. This song is in the running for best video and best pop song at the VH-Logos. And thanks too the Logons for creating a BOTOTMO! blog! Well they created mine because they made my BOTTO
this masterwork. Take the concept, for instance. Fruit, naturally the pits of the produce world for most of humanity, are suddenly cast as the underdog protectors and hero figures; a fresh take on an otherwise widely disregard object. Thematizing cherries, banana's tomates et. al in an intense, dark, sci fi movie is a task generally not attempted, and the execution of this guts and glory concept can rightly earmark Pixars latest triumph. For being viscerely (pun intended!) witty and beautiful for the first twenty minutes of its 90min run time. And it is. This picture grabbed me by my belt, and demanded that what I really needed in my soul was to see anthropomorphized fruits chase some berries. The 3D animation is like a great new flavour of ice cream--sublimely and perfectly made, and with a deluxe treat menu to boot. With a great comedy line up to boot (and that I can admit wasnt given enough screen-action), 'Wrinkles in Time'; has so far earned cult status; and I for myself would love to go back for another serving of this movie. But as deliciously animated, well rendered, and funny as this movie gets, there is still an empty pit residing in the middle of this film. Even for a st
main characters are never named, this movie reveals much more about the two main figures than did Mann's storyline, thus shedding some insight into his motivations. While many of the critics hated it despite the Oscar-nominations, others reviewed it quite strongly. I found the movie intriguating and worthy enough to spend eight dollars on. Let'e go! Daphnaed Bardem stars as Gustav von Aschenkas, the rich and popular but aging conducting master of the Salon, whose real fame is quite near to its end. Udo Kroger as Baroque conducts at his command, Aschenkas at first sees a perfect opportunity when he catches the sight at the beach in Venice of Aaron, the 25 year -old great American violinst and his accompanist Son. But as Aschenka soon discovers after bringing up the question of bringing up the name to the American' twosome, that the violinist and his sidekick have been quite famous for keeping themselves in the closet. At the moment, though, Aschenka sees a chance for himself of being on the side of one. The violinst and his accompanies are a pair to be reckoning within the gay community despite the lack of an actual relationship, but both are lovers. They travel from city to city where Aschenka conducts a performance, and in those cities, the

I was able...and wanted to sit down for to the very last. There isn’ t much of a sexual storyline (yep guys get lucky more then once) and with good reason, the character driven story is that good. Unlike the previous "Bodied Pumps" outing, its solid 1950's family feel is still quite strong - giving "Doorways" a film that can hold it&acute;s own against films of the era that it so loves to embrace - no small feast on the aspect of film making. There are far more memorable characters then most 1-and-done films in their league, and some of them had some of my best personalities ever brought to film (John Phillip Law and Susan Lynn as a married couple is the second best instance that come to mind, and I never saw "Bogie" and "Hepburn." RIP) It's a fun time, and I&iacutes'm hoping the 2nd installment of this one comes out very soon. And hopefully there are more to come. This is one film that could gain massive popularity, and should be revisisted - and you should go into "Doors" having no expectations, and just enjoy. It's that good. This is one that is truly going into my all time collection, and it&iacutese;s time consruction
made! Yeah! I said it! It'd be a lie. Sure, it're some good... I'll give ya' good. But come oooon. It'd be a stretch ta call it great! I was looking through a box of old VHS's this morning that have been collecting dust for quite somme tiiiimme... And this movie was in there... It's on the right. See, I must'd tell you 'bouth this movie because it's awfully important to my family. My daddy saw this flippin movie in his youth. He told about it. I went to watch it with him. It didn a' thing for me! I thought it sucked! But, dad' loved dumb old movin pictures, oh well. Dad, did anythin' else good? But, he kept tell about it! He kept tell about it! He told about the songwritin' stars. He tried ta get excited 'n' he couldn' even wait fo a plythrough! I became a fan of it mysel'. It'd been at leaast 25 years since he last mentioned this movie at all, then he mentioned, he watched it AAAAAAANGE AGAaaain just this morning! This kind, nice old man with a big ol, warm smile on 'is ugly ol, lil face! He
didn't even understand the plot of the film that much, but was still imbued with the vibe and mood. With years gone by, and the honeyed glare of nostalgia covering my eyes; maybe I could revisits this film? I started off with so-so impressions, but as the movie rolled, it became increasing more delightful to watch... and by its finale I can declare with conviction that this movie has to had been my greatest surprise of the year so here. For a cheap Asian rip off movie, the creators seems very passioned and had put it up way up there with the classics. As a parody movie, it has to be one of the most successful and best that I'v saw. Instead of outright rip off of better known film, they rip offs of rip off and the results were hilarous and entertaining as hell. Every scene is like one gigantic, endlessly chain of Star Degrading oneupmanship. At some point, it wasn'r even Star Destroyer, but Star Destroyer Destrotructor! This movie made me realize a ton of movie that I've taken granted as originals. So I might aswell, lay off at Dirty Harry or Die, Hongi. There'll always more to movielovers than the original, and this film dares reminds me of that truth in this
I saw the film, made me wonder why director Wayne Wenders, didnÂ¹ft include any of Anne Bancroke (Sister)Â¹s great performances to back up his picture showcase.As we soon learn in this movie the two starlet’s play a very dilettanterd(easy-come-easily- gone) mother and daughter role trying their best to make it into a really great movie with a really nice happy ending.So as I was wondering about this, when upon noticining from a distance the scene behind Mr.Wenders.A scene where the camera was aimed at a tree and a beaver was gorging itself upon the wood of the tree, with a rachet(chomp)and then as the beavers mouth was stuff of to the brime.There mouth broke open and fell at his(if the gnawer is of a male variety),side.(thatÂ¹f for a good laugh).I can assuage my sorrow on the scene at hand and wait for another beaver(beaver scene from another motion-picture).I am an arduerous beaver believer(again,you can thank me later).So as Any-where-but-here continues.After Mrs,Sheridan(Mrs.Susie Sheridan)and her daughter Aubrun Pullmen.Reach their new destination city of California.
ten. I thought of making it and then thought who is going do what I know I can’t do it. I would spend the rest of today trying to write these first ten lines I would be tired so I will try again and again, and again but I won't be able. So I have decided its a ten but I can't make up my Mind. I can' put my finger why but then when you write it's a better story to begin a review. What the hell do others do and say about it. I have a flickr page and it say, "it really is a great film. It's a fantastic film that should be seen by all young people, but where it failed in that aim is where the film los, too many plot holes and unexplained points left me feeling unsatisfactory when the film finished. I suggest that if you want a night of entertainingly and a laugh, but not for young ears as a lot of the speech is not meant to be repeated then view it, I'm sure that you will laugh as much as I, but go with someone you enjoy being around as you will hate the film for leaving the room and getting some one else. It is a film that should not be missed, just not by the young kiddies." From the film' s main website, http://www.youtube/watch/The_Better_Call_Girl A good film
Christopher Nolen as director, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bales and Michael Cain. It was a decent story with an unusual twist to the ending that I liked. The twist in itself was unusual, but the change in the past that would alter everything in the present was kind of "cheap". However the movie got better through out and I was very happy with it. I'd recommend it just for the story. Here'a a quote that sums up the movie for you: "If you understand time, you understand life." Overrated for its effects, but once you finish you'd say "Good movie!". I will give 4 stars just in that it is a tad overratted. Too many people are talking how great a picture it really didn; t stand out as much as I'd hoped. No more than 6 or so quotes though, when I was looking up for them, but if I wanted, to I could't dig out many other lines that'd be relevant, but that are not quotes: "What happened here today wasn'thappening." "If you understand the time, you'llunderstant what happened." "Time is the key to everything."(I loved that one!) "No one wants their past to catch up to their present... The past can only hurt the present. (I liked that 'present'), I could go on and so forth... So, It was
the viewer who appreciats its artistic style and patience. It is a study of what leads a man into a belief or faith, and then we follow the man into faith. The film is set in Pambula, New South Wales. The three main characters in the film are Dr. David Ross (Jimmy Smits) who has just married his third wife, Karena, (Anna Torvare) a local nurese. His first wife Rachel (Eliette Steckel) and his second wife, Sylvie, (Clacy Cummiski) died of very mysteriouse couses. In Australia this area is called the "Three Capers." The last woman who lived on the land with him died. Every woman and every child who lived with him died. He sees this death curtain in front him a sinister thing. He belives that someone or some influence is out to kill everything that has ever been connected wth his wife, Sylvia including himself and the nurese Karena whom he has married now. There is an old Aborigine (Noni Hudson), who lives nearby as part of the Australian Aborigine presence there. She befriends David and wriatns out signs and drawings for him, which he cannot read or understand, because he does nto know the Aborigine lanuauae. The film, staring Jimmy Smtns, is well-made, and the character of
until I went in, and to tell you how clued out and oblivous I was (yeah I know) at the end of it when 3 of me friends asked me what I thought of the film with disgust and anger on thir faces. My reply: I don't really care. I never read it so I had already judaged the movie by its time I saw it, I know what I see is not everything, but to tell the hard truth, there was nothing there. The visuals were in your face, more so then they could be. A lot was going going, a lot, tooo goin. The plot was non existnant. I know that is just how the story is or something, I know it did not have much of a plot per-se. But a film MUST have a plot. It didn\ has to have a huge, elaborate, drawn out story. A plot is a basis to make a film out out of. There wes not a lot of acting going on in it at first, but tat was ok, still not a deal break as well, again I knew what was coming, or at least what I thought. The acting was not on-point, but it was tolerable, but really... The plot is wattered down to the point that you don' be able tooo tell what is going on moste oft he time, except for the "flashbacks
too clever for it’s own good. As a ghost movie..The spirit has more..and I mean lots..more of the creeps going for it and the feel I wish Oujja would’ve had..in the movie. Where The Oujja comes up short in the creeping out.. Its makes up for in the action..the ending is a big let-down, though. The soundtrack is out ..gone..gross. Donnie Yen was better as the priest in the Spirit. Over all the Oujja is a pretty big let down that reeks a little a the time has come to go to the video vault yet it still earning big time box office money. I suspect, though. The audience will see it fall a bit in the coming weeks though. It looks to easy now and the action got old and boring pretty fast especially when he’s constantly fighting some shirtless guy.I noticed director Sung-hoon. Woo in his Oujja directorial was over lighted in the movie. The camera light got a bit annoying. There are moments in the movie that will make your blood curtle and Oujja is an entertaining movie , although I would probably have a different opinion if I was Asian..But I’d give the movie a 3 out 4 stars, Oujja. So for me..it gets a 3 … just for entertain
everyone goes on to their next life afterwards! The whole thing, its like a big fat lied to me!! WHHHHHHAAAAAAA!! And if you ever meet my sister you are lucky she liked it herself, else I'd be so mad at you guys and you for making a fake fake fake fake....... fake. So there! Yeah, like that'd stop me buying. NO WAIT! The Dude, like that's going to make his sisters death anything less than the worst thing ever!!! WTF! How did that happen?! You all made him that way!!! *SCREAMS IN ANGEL HAVE SEX AND MAKE LOBOTOMIES!!* WTF. Lest I just leave it with WHOA. Just saying. Its nothing but lies. LIEEEEERRRRRSSSS. BIG Fat ones too. Oh, Alan's still alive though. Just to let ya know. He'll probably die soon. Maybe. Probably is more accurate to say. I don,t know what happened half way through my books but they're all different. Maybe this one was a bit more.... I Don'l know. Just say it your story. Y'know? Cause thatz how you do it. If people like it that iz great. But if it doesn, t the reader can just walk away and then he never knows
me when I tell when will you become the main character, it gets better don't stop from watching this video I love this series and I recommend it as my top pick to any one who is into an interesting but dark series that makes you think and doesn;t pull any of it's plot holes!? trust mr. 1,10,14 ,7.1,13 are good!! WOW is all, that need to be saiD for episode 7. I had mixed feels about this episode but I loved this episode, especially at last part. and yes I am biased because I was a big fan in the manga anime back in middle school I was heart- broken but I started tearing them up and in 206 where a certain character comes in very last part I found my interest in it coming back a long time ago! Can't Wait. TT"v Also my 11 year. I am biased because of back middle but I've had the ming since back then and on for the first series got me started in this anibes is s what started my love for anime! I love One Piecet don't stop watching series! trust when this gets better because the series gets better after 15! and the manga is better for me because I love One PIeece mango so gdly recommended is my love. Anyways,
over acted (Kenny Rogerson is a great line for Hallmark cards or as a stage monolog-not a serious movie character) and I didn’y appreciate the blaring music during the whole movie or the scary masked madman (Ken who is a 28 y/o high school kid) who rush up every single time someone turns on lights and or when they are afraid. Yes the first hour of the two that I watched was slow, then the last 24 minuues spat out a lot with what could have been a great movie but came out as sloppty and unreal. I was so disgust as i was watching it with the intention to review it for the website i work for-and I’m sorry, I’m the most positive revier on the site giving bad moviies a B, C and even a few Ds and this one is a FU ck 0 outta 0. That’s it, as my bros and I says…PFFTTT! Sorry everyone. Even if there was an actual gore scene, which there is none, this movie would still be poorly made(didnÂ’t even care to finish it)and the cast members are either way too exaggerated and or overrrad or too blank to give a positive review. As i said a B and even a c would be a better review than this
outrageously fun) for me and for people in my generation who like watching bad guys take a bullet (ok, two to be safe). Ben King was a military intelligence officer in the 1990's and was discharges for insubordiant behavior at a time in our country's history we'll call - the good old times.

months ago at the endless stream of nudie-pics hitting the internet. It was like being part of a cool fraterniti, having seen the hilarious documentaries Sex in Amsterdam, Sex in Paris, Sex and the City, and now I was watching Sex from Scratf. Not to be left behind like the country hick my parents wornt me too be I saw it on its first night in America a few weeks ago. Was it worth it my only question is, did I pay $81.05 fo a movie ticket? Cause I paid like $6.65 and gave 75 cents of the profet to the Salvation Army. It was only ictual from the DVD. So is that 75 cents I gave to the less-fprhiliate really going to help anyone? If not...I think i shall continue my boycot of the cinema. But if anyone wants me, you can catch me there a few Fridats a year.

a series paint dry'. The artful painter and his paint pad. Yawn. I didn'ta t all and I fell sound asleep in the art gallery. The next day I sat very still, which was not as easy for me as it was going from art gallery into the cinema. Artful Dodge has been liken to "Teachin' the Piano to the Pit Pony". I had a difficult time distinguishing the dialogue among the conversant characters and their submerged motivation, justification and empathy. This movie had no apparent reason why and had me reaching for the remote control so I could turn it off, but I could tell this movie was trying to accomplish something and I forced myself to watch a little bit more and could not find any more 'something.' And then I reached for my bag like Carole Lombarde and scream for the real world "I don' want to hear any more about that darn picture." I sure would not want to watch this movie unless everyone else started falling a sleep and the movie would be over in just a few short minutes. 'Art Dodge' is a painting in the picture and we never was allowed a view as he used paint thinners in the middle of the movie; I awoke at the film' very end. Perhaps this painting might be a better picture when seen to the end; perhaps even best if it were viewed by me at home, by myself. There
Full to the brim with great talent and even more enthusiasts. Great company. Happy to spend money to improve their own pleasure and to help bring out our work. Always willing to go the extra yard to ensure you return enamored. A pleasure to show them all and very well remunerated. Thank You Nigel, Tony, and all the boys in the team! Forgive the overt enthusiast language. After all you are a team. A delightful team. And a joy. After such a good performance I cannot write much more...but will. We were enhanced by having a good technical support on the course helping with scoring, time keeping, video clipping and above the tee support. All part being an event of this nature... And a major credit to all of you. A note that I could perhaps put in to the hands or emails or whatever to all the top pros as a general idea would be great. Maybe mentioning that they can expect to be handled with respect and be looked at kindly on and off the golf course. Not expect to find it rough, at the least. And being able and know we will not turn the air conditioning off and leave you in a warm car..and not expect to be greated in a friendly fashion. I don;- expect these guys are out expecting an extended or even warm welcome. Maybe I could call these guys THE TOM JENKEN PROS. In the
quality in a while. i would say i have been a very luck fan since season one of Bones. I will say i liked Angels and demons bt i think book is a little to much like da vince code plus i really dislike the movie. this show on the other hands is much ore engrossing with stunning visual effects and a very good story line. the writing of every episode holds my attention throughout the show. if only all network script writer could write half as capturing or inventive as this show. i give it a five star on the rating scale for the production quality alone! and of couse the acting is great and the story even better. i think this show will do good as long as you keep it up but this is one show id never miss an epsiode of. it is brighter a show in my mind than star gate or the x- files. i think it one of best sc-fi/fantasy shows on tv at the present time, i would like to try out the game on my PC but haven’tt gotten around too it yet. i can see this show going for a long time 5 stars also for the games development as well. now i hope you guys will make better game out of san and gregorys books. by the by i don’ t like the new star gate series i did buy the season I thought the season 1 epsiode where san and gre
I soon became a fan. The movie is about a married Navy pilot and his pretty wife; but when he has a near death crash experience together with a hot-to-trot single flight crew member - a little magic happens and he asks his wifey to play Lily Munsey, a 55 year-old - in order save their marriage. But, OMGoodness, it is a dumb trick! Never mind, the movie is as wild and crazy and is a sneakily erotic romp, and, I have a confess, it was really funny in places. A truly entertainment movie. The very seam that threatens the marriage and the man'so integrity is played like to the hilt, The whole plot is like that, very corny, and it was not too often I laughed out loud at movies. Maybe this was because the movie was set in the very early 1980s. But that was also the charm: Certainly the movie couldn't be set then and its magic does not translate at least today [ 9.5.32] well enough to be enjoyably. Jocelyn Jones, for me, is a sexy, yet tender, woman, and she is a very good actress. In this, her first real bobby-does-everybody-in a movie she proved just how good she was and probably has been in

They are all hiliariolus, especially this funny one! So, I hope no one gets mad at you for the effort you put in :D ! Thanks!!! Love it! Peace, Bros. Peace Out! No Cap, No Feedback! ;) .

technology, etc. The film has strong cast of veterans and newcomers. The plot is fresh – based upon the popular Chinese book. The film was well received by critics and audiences. The American box office was $5.6 million. The box-offices in China and other Asian countries were even higher. It is an example of high budget, high production values, international production with stars and high ambitions. Most Hollywood moviemaking now is largely reactive, chase money, and do not challenge the norms or even break ground in movie themes. ‘Dragons Blood’ is an example to the other side for all of them to see there are other ways to make moviews. And it was made in Canada! Yes! There are many excellent productions made and can made here in Canada! I hope more productions of the same calipper come to the big screen here in the future. It would also be nice if Hollywood producers would even see them and maybe have a look at some of the ones that we have here! Perhaps we could get some of our great stories (we surely have many) made and out to a broader audience. A ‘Dragons Bloods Blood” is an appetizer to that big screen mea. And I want more. One of the most refreshening facts about ‘‘DB’’ is the fact there are many production houses represented here – from Hollywood studios, to
though none were appropriate for kiddie eyes. I went from being screamingly freakish to completely unmoved by ghosts and ghoulies: no more fainting when the creepers pop out of the closet in the old black & whites: my bored, faux-jaundiced gaze would bore straight through the screen. My grand mother, on the other hand, who had always taught her children to say “Hai Bajoo” before turning off the lights, still feared movies like “Psycho”. Grand Mother was squeamish too. She would be terribly frightened each afternoon on her way to fetch Nanhi from the bus stop when the boys in the neighbourhood shrieked out as they suddenly turned out in front (or, alternatively back as they quickly jump into the way. You take what-ever you can get in an Indian neighborhood). She took one brave look as she approached them and then rerouted her path to another, gentler alleyway. She was easily spooked. In fact those small, easily scared girls in the children’sfairytale books were often my favourite characters as they often came to good in spite of having no hero-like qualification to save them. She-she was the one who snuck out of her tent at the end so as to hear once more the lullaby sings of the children
the fucked up bits, I closed my mind to it and just enjoyed it for the weirdest thing to come out of a mind that made Fulci'spast films. All I care to say is if it is soo great that they keep putting it out, release it in one format. I like the DVD, as that is all I have seen, but if they put out a beautiful 5000 unit run Blurays, or 35mm versions (DCP'S?) I would buy at least one. Don"t whore out and re-release the dvd over and over... we get the picture. I don"t care about seeing blood from 10 years prior. Give me new material. I'd be more than happy to buy the disk even if it sux, but if we are to get this 40th anni, and it comes with 2 discs, and only one has anything that you want, that is a bum feeler. You will have to pay for it anyways, it is soo rare. I imagine at least.. you might find one ding dongs film cell in it... but what I really want isn't the color version, it is the dam scene from the film, all day in to eve. That scene is burn et in my mind. To be able to watch it with some kind of sound... That would make my year! I

with her usual array of endearing, slightly off center friends. From the opening scene, it was obvious that it was a lightweight, summer romance but in a good way. Meg and her friends are sweet and likeable. The plot had few holes as long and you understand that this story is not a serious rom-com but an up-beat story that you wouldn't take too much into consideration. Although the ending is a bit of a stretch, it't not unsatisfiing at the same time (the stretch was at her parents house but not with her friend.) Overall if you have a few hours and want a sweet enjoyable film, this will fill the bill nicely without disappointing. A must for Meg fans. If I didn'e own the dvd, I'd buy one as it was so enjoyable. This DVD is now available in the dvds and blurays area. It'e always been one for me to watch during the holidays and it's so good and one to watch more than one or few! a lighthearted but realistic story about a shiney new city girl who befriend'e a few butcherous locals who work at her fathers butchery. A feel good comedy with lots of laughs, Meg Ryan proves she' be a fine actress and her boy friends and friends are so cuted. Definitely a good buy. I've seen this
couldn’ t accept the film as a whole. In fact I felt that the acting was too good to be true. Some of it was, but not when you consider the part is a deformed character (which he does portay briliently). In fact I felt this film was more about him than the story line, I thought it a little bit (a lot) on depressing. I didn? t find it fullfillig, just depressingly realistic. In the film his whole behaviour is reduced to his surroundings, just the people who accepted him, and not much more, but he would never want any kind of change in his situation. And he should! I think the same goes for the other characters who came across the same message, but on a more real scale in human scale, because I think life holds much bigger, more extraordinary, more beautiful, more touchy surprises that are to be discover, but only if you feel worthy enough to make and follow your own decisions, not those of others. Anyways, I did like the film and the acting, and it was also sad how everyone has his or her part to play. At the end the most supressesd one had I think also the biggest talent to do something truly worth it. I thought it was also sad to see how they tried hard to hide the truth. But that? in life as well. I myself in many occasions. So maybe it brought nothing
Although the director is new to me so I’m not going on past experience to assert that he’s a hack, the storyline is a far-cry from untouchably awful. In spite of this horrific story, the acting in the film is absolutely terribad. All of this, plus an embarrassingly generic soundtrack, and well, you get Pirate Radio . But, why be mad at Pirate Radio for all it isn/s defects? It’ll never be anything special like The Boa’ . But, why be mad at Pirate … 562-410-4207 . But why not? For most of the students a large factor in choosing a university was the location. But why am I always getting so tired it’ll pass by itself. They were just … a. Bad, good and neutral (and why not all reviews are 3-5 star ratings) – here come the reviews! . One of the characters is played by Billie Pi… Why the he** should anyone care about this sh**, you ask? . I’ve never been to Scotland in the off season.

St. Clair (Gerard O'Grad), an Englishman, played by Fredric March, arriving in Newport, Rhodes Island to serve on his country ' s diplomats. Here he meets Elizabeth, played by Ingrid Hertford. It is assumed that we now know that this is a film which takes place in the time of the War Onterrorist. Then, when he arriv's in Newport she agrees to pose as his wife for 20 days after his visits to numerous wealthly New England families. Apparantly, and according to customs of that era as in other foreign countries there isn ' ts such a thing as ' unattacehd ' at many events and society. What Elizabeth does not know is that he is himself attached, though not in a marraige. This is typical of the misunderstandings which turn this film into such an entertaining romantic ' comedy ' about some of Newport, and wealthy American society who can't seem ' to help themselves by stickering to the strict protocols of their own behavior, and their own times. She, the youngest and only nonattache of the group, is drawn into a seriesof events that makes her uncomforable, and this of course causes the frissure between her husband, who is also an Englishman, and the English diplomatic group she is to serve. Elizabeth 's best friends are also Elizabeth '
’ve watched and re watched it so much. Yes I tend to watch historical movies over watching comedy ones, I think I have seen all of Mel Brook’ (except for Robin Heads), and a lot if other action comedys so to mix it up, I need to have history as a backdrop to a great story line and dialogue. I’ll be the first to say that P&M is not a Oscar award winning script, with many of its historical inaccuraencies (even the costume is not actually from the time of Charles II) but my history degree is not in Jacobite Movement or Charles 11 & 2, so for the purpose of keeping the story moving, I think it works. What I’m really here to praise about the movie is the fabulious acting of the wonderful Robert Vahavanay, and that gorgeous girl from Shrek Angelia Lindstrom who plays Daisie Macleaune, and its the chemistry and humility these two characters have on the big time, big name actors in the industry which keep me coming for more. Just a warning there will probably be a lot lot of spoilers in there. Have a read through and have a think if you like P&m too and if you just found out what this movie is all about. Let me see if you know what I’d rant on a about. . You think we could do some
the time to watch this horror fused with drama on a dilematic day. This film is directed by Jennifer Kent that takes on the horror genre into another interesting perspective having only watched the first and second-rate films of this nature. Troy is a film that I believe will suit the tutor who wants their student to see something worth watching and dig a little deeper into the philosophical sense. Behind the veil and layer of horror, Troy was a horror film with a lot going on subtextually and a good film to discuss about with older students. One thing I will take away from this film apart from a genuinly frightening nightms sleep is the significance and the use of classical and operative score in the sound design. On one note, I have not heard a film score so powerfully and scary and to the point at times where it was almost unnerving. 'There is a witch in the room' is a film that I would recommend to friends to watch although some say it has many paralelles with 'The Ring' - but I disagreed. Being one of the few films I have seen that puts forward the terror and suspence beyond the fourth wall, it is one of the more better acted performances I have witnessed and the direction is more focused in captiviting the audience's attention that one could possibly see within the first few seconds of the film. I gave it a watch and I
sick for about aweek with the flu (the actual movie was about 10-24 hrs long accordingto my mother and she thought I was a little obsessions but heck I was sick sowhat the Hell . I have always remembered this movie and it brought awhole new meaning in some of the scenes. When I tell you this I will let youknow for those viewing this web site this story has a warning for those who do notknow it. At the beginning scene of the movie you see a cat lying on the road. Iat first had not noticed this and this cat looked familiar but then I noticed itwas a white tux cat like mine. In the story they had used my cateverywhere she went. In one of the scenes she played on a fireman and she wasone sad kittle but cared so deeply for those who were in trouble she couldnothing to save (I had sent the cat who at that point looked prety sad) andin another I was going to give her back to a friend but she had to find herfamily who had adopted her. I know it was horrible how she had to be abandonedint different places in other states but it was that night when I saw it thatmade me have other fear I still toil to this day. They had used someone'shouse or something and they had come in with a bag of cat with a red cord aroundthier neck and the bount was
it was a bit stupid having a grown man ride a motorcybi; and two the "boom" a man makes when he droosps from great height. Funniy, when we say "boom," every one on the set thinks you've farted! Mighty fine for a kid! But you wanna know something funnier? I never saw the whole thing and I still don' think I did. So many things going on on this set. You know, I mean it was really crappy when we were making Wild Bill because even the extras were stealin stuff. I mean...they stole my black belt! It was in my trunk one minute and it wasn't the next. This all went down at a place out near L. a place called Paradiso Mobile Estabishments...now that place is really off the map; paradisomoble! But did you know that they were making Lethal Injunction right in the next camper! We call it the pookah and it has a real class place. I remember tellink the rest guys from Lucky Star how we were going out for pork. That whole drive was the greatest. They took us to this drive-in place out of this world...dynomot. Those are some fine driving cops we got up there and they must have fined us an apiece. Just on account of the car windows
I was bi against this movie before I saw any reviews or heard anyone say anything bad about the 2nd inc. of the movie. And then to top it ALL OFF, I saw the TRAINER ONE DAY AT WARGO and got a BACKWARDS VIBES VERY LOUDLY. I couldn't move. Somehow I got out of War/Gor but was still a little shooken... ANWYAY, when I seen it, after seeing THE EX, I wonder why the people get so SURVIVNG about this movie? I just say, wait till the DVD is out! Get it, enjoy the movie, and don't get all WASSEI about the remake!!! It'll be all the kewl! As far as the bad review, I say, "Go see it! And don 'T CRY "WIC KER HERERY!" DUMB ASSESS!!!!!! I SAYS, PRE FER THIS RECYCLE, BE CAFFEI PEEP S! HELEN IS HOT! That's a good reason to go! But seriously... It's more of an HXORIO COMEDY INSTAD OF A DRAME! STOP BEING DRIVED AND GAWAY AN DGET IT OND!

right at the beginning--and was made with the same collaborating auteurs as The Bicyclist Thief. It's a film adaptation of James M Cain's The Long Postponed first published by St Maur in 1549 (sorry), and is very close on a very long postponed basis. Based on screenwriter Cesira Anderson-Curtin's treatment, a young couple on the run from a crime (the bank jobs of the young male is an influence on BBB, of course, and this may be the first main credit for the great Toti dalam) arrive at the farmhouse of a poor young woman, where the female pursued becomes obsessions with the man himself and both indulge in a prolonger extrendendendend! Of a postponement. No really, the opening paragraph of this write up is one sentence, take the time to count the number of words in the previous sentence! How much longer can you end before you endendendendend, this film is one of the most endured things going, and not even John Sturm's gliding visuals can keep you stuck in seat long from end. Still it is the most interesting element of enduring works like Visconti or Alfred Hittcock, is who ends up as a director. In this film they have signed for next project, a superhairy western epic. Is this the only film
it for later. I wasn´t at home when the taped episode played so I phoned my auntie & asked her to tape it for a second time. It played again late that evening..and she was stillnt home so I rang a cousin to tell hir it was meant for her too! And he said he´ll tape it if I cant be home for it the next evening. I couldnt believe someone was taping a programme that was meant to play at 3 am and 6 am! I was about asleep when my aunie played that tape back for me..to see that my awe had watched the episode, recorded the whole thing over with a repeat episode of All Creatures Great and small and missed me off! I had to borrow a friend of mine´s video to watch the show at a later time (thank goodness I taped it). It was great...and from now on I will tape them first thing in the morning...and play the tape at night time! Its just a waste if I dont get to see the show, just because I cant be at my mum´s house at darn sarificial times! Its a good job I didnt taped some other show by accedently when she meant not to..otherwise that would have been the end of Beware, my love...as wellas lost episodes of Dr Who, Star Trek etc which she
ever seen. Sorkin gives us characters that are much more then just people, these people are heroes to our country, not everyone knows of these men, but you've heard of them. They protect us and they keep us free as long as they are alive and they are willing to risk their whole being to keep us free. Saving Private Ryan will go down in the books of history and so should these men. Sorkin took these men' horse's lives and put their dreams, hopes , and memories into a two and a half-three hours movie, and had it be the most realistic thing ever created. I'm not much for romance but this has some and that made even seem more human. Everyone should see it and now you have to admit that Saving Private Sheet is ............. The Best.W.A._R_.Film_o...@yahoogroup.com (12.19)... I agree that its a great movie, but by the end of the movie, you're just as sad that it's over. Too much romance. Saving private sheet.... A great movie, but not the best of that category... "Bridge Over The river Quai" takes the honours. Sasquache13@hot...@aol.com 08.04.2000... The Best I know of.
actually quite the enjoyable film, save for a few missed scenes. The concept for the film is in an interesting idea and is well executed. When the film is released on Bluerays in Europe/Asia, I would definitely recommend it. And yes, I'm sure it'd be the 3D version. By no way did she seem like a 'whore,' as some review here states, it'll be a different story when it is released or available with English subtittles, wheter she likens herself to a whale. And yes 3D does have an effect on many of these films, for better, and for worse. But like anything, there are good and better ways to execute any film, and the 25/30 minutes "3DDD:" scenes didnt even need any 2D frames, the editing to make these 2D scenes were rather good, only problem was the lack of scenes. I give this film a B-, if not a B. It's got a solid core, and a solid idea, and storyline, and a few missed scenes. By no means is an English-subbed Blurays with English subtittles any more "eductational" to the actual film. And by the way, I'm not Japanese, I have not had any sexual experiences (thought I would use this forum that people would take more seriously a male than a female),

the people in prison are just mentioned, with no visual aid. I could bareby see it on my laptop. After watching several minutes, I stopped it. Last night I recorded it, hoping more light woud come. But now watching the ending of the movie, I see the same is true here also, I have to laugh. It's as if I've seen 'the trial from behind'. These last 10.06 seconds the background is shown. This is the whole trial in a little time frame. At the end you see a little piece of 'the hangings'. No victim faces shown. It'll be a good work for somebody to ask permission to show the faces of the so-called warcriminal victimes. I know some victims faces from the site of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, you should be allowed, for the sake of justice and history, to see who have been prosecuted. ( I've written to the Center about the victime's pictures and I was informed that the Center doesn' like my opinion to show these pictures because of my Holocaustomski site.) The people I know are; Ernst Lohmeier, Walter Kutschera (Von Erlach) and a 6 years old boy, Wilm HOSP (his body only). There are more victimes, but I didn;t recognice them by not getting the faces. You can watch the trial here;

all make for scares with a very human twist and turn, when the monster is literally one you meet on the train next Tuesday morning. Rather than the monsters we usually deal within horror movies, both from the classic 31 Days of Horror list and beyond which have featured creatures that are fantational, otherworldy, and other-anly gory, the villain of this movie-and no I’ll spill who it is in a moment, but it is a very different kind of movie for the list-is very, very real and very, very freakish. Cary Hayes was not like every man out there-he wasn;’tt normal. He wasn’ t mentally ill, in his own mind. He was not dangerous, in most peole’ s view; he even brought good cheer to the office, and he was a devoute religious Christian. So hpo well-adjusts wasn't hbe? Turned o,t you may well ask. Why, you ask? On Tuesdays, dear readers. Here’’s why. First off, we talk why this movie is on the list, and how-desipted the creeptatic effect-it is very much an older movie, and the makeup effects of the movie aren’ wotn’ t so much scary (except in one shohning way I’ll detail
Christmas comedy about a father who losities hope (or even belief) in his teenaged-son, right in front of our eyes — but in a peculiarly humorous sense. I suspect that the director of this film may be an atheis, having heard him talk about how he used to play a piano organ in a pentecostal church and how, one fine day, a preacher announced that every member in the parish should believe or else. The film's director is therefore not necessarily sympathizing exactly the same way as I do with the father of the little hero who first decides he has lost faith, since this film is clearly written that way for the sake of a storyline which can take us down many divergent paths. Yet I sin at the core agree that religion is often more a matter for faith in something than belief that something is true. Read more on www,Cinemayak.dk. (Daniel Mørks).

(see the earlier post about The Little Prince) written in an easy to read style. It has fantastic art to go along with the book, as well an uproarious musical score (with fun songs like it doesn't matter). And as much as you want to like it, the execution somehow just doesn't work. And the first stop on this wild ride of poor direction is, naturally, the visual effects. The giant planet with the single beds, and the munchkins in the garden are the work Vince Guaraldi-like vision of Philippe Coctau. And while they are adorably quaint recollections of early 60ies sci fi, as is the Sputnick that makes an unecessarily large exit, the rest come down to the worst type of childishness and are far removed of anything that was in either the 1950's book or illustrations of SaintExpuper's original tale. In this world, the asteroids are clearly made up of giant heads and faces (including one that looks ominosoly like Borugov'e monster). The desert is repleat with rocks that bear a striking remenissance off human faces, as is a large bouldars that is a a giant cobblers last toed lumps of pumice (yes that visual detail is important for the story). The swarmings are green and have

in a forge while craftsmanship proceed. Stillness in this respect is a type is of staring, of awing, of witnessing, of waiting, of gather a shards or slivers for the creation to develop and so allow the drama to move forward with some plaushlessness. But the pay off for me was such, and though “I’m with stupid” was not far from my thoughts, I let myself be taken in, and once there, almost any and all of my expectancy for what a film of such vibes might demand had to be sacrificed for. I would be very interested in an interview about how this film came to existence, because it had a lot of potential to be a disastrouns misfire, but it was not. I appreciate knowing the general information about the the making and story of this 1983 cult classic film, but there’ have been very few that have interested me as to how the process of such a film came to be. (I am sure that the answers will have been given before.) For with filmmaking, and filmmkaing about a cult, the two have to be more joined at head and foot than any other pursuet. Well, besides film with foot. Does that make sene to anyone? No, well I said it; goshdarnit. Moving right along though! —KC#179 on Flickchart.
a movie not worth watching and does not deserve any rating. Diana Paola is not a good lead actress either, her acting skills are well...nonexistant.

love this kind of movie but for some people this kind is bored. I think MALICE is good for those people who love such kind because this movie could be one of those for who love very nice thrilling movie with some action. In this kind of movie i like to have an amazed face on my face after watch this for the most time. Such thrilling and good thrilling but some thrill could be fun also. But i still like to think that this is good movie. I think these will make this movie better than before to watch in this kind of watch. And of course the acting and the screenplay also must be better than before so it must make this movie better when watch. Everyone could see when this movie is good to be watch because it more than just a good movie or its good for who love this thriller and action movie. I still like to think that this one of those movie. i want to recommentable this to everyone who lov is like i am but if there are who not i like could be ok because even i said is good movie but not a great but of course a fun and thrilling movie. I want to recommendable this for the fans who love this kind of movie and for the critics also who have got boring of romance movie and another movie than romantic. I like to think that everyone wound like it so i hope this can make this movie success. i wish that this is so popular for
make a better future for his two boys. I cant believe that he did a spit take in his car at a light pole. I have never seen that before, but it made me laugh for sure. The car crash where his new girlfriend and her son died in the crash and then he found out he was going to jail for the murder really drew out a plea from myself. The whole time I was watching Caley get washed up and carried away I just kept saying, "Damn, are they really going there? " Even though I feel bad for Cary staring everyones new greek lover I feel Case would'nt choose someone with such a history, at least for himself, so I wouldn´'tknow why anyone would for him. I think Rebekah was the perfect murderer, but it may backfire on her if Ryan can bring someone to come into the basiment to help him back to life so to hopefully save her. There were too many death scenes for me to keep track so bare with my stupid mind. haahaha. But I may say I was right about the new greek goddess being the murder or I might be dead wrong. I look foward to finding out. Please bring back one more time, love it and miss it. Thanks for the time you took to read my comment. ;-) And my favorite gals are Rebeckah and Caseys mom, love them

creative chaotism of the Fab 3 (George was at the bottom of their list, they hated him most in the 10 years story). However they made ‘A Hard Days Nig. and in the end did a fine production film with great music, great songs, nice costumes, nice people working together. No great message but if you wann some good film production, that is one of the bet to choose. It’s not a master-work, it’s just a nice and very well done film, which can take you for a ride. No droning through this: it’ s fun and for a Sunday nice film to watch. Well made, well said, with some nice and surprisingly good acting. A bit of cheese, some fun and you go. Cheers! It’ was an enjoyable evening. 8 /okm. by me. Oh, and the soundtrack? Well that’ s a different thing to thing about, enjoyable, interesting, moving: it’ s The Beetles. Let’s put ‘s a question: Is it a Beeties album or is t a soundrack album? Well I feel it’s a bit more of a film album, than an album proper and for me that’ s the idea it has- not bad at al, but don'’ t give it 5 star, as it’s not gion The Best, but ok.
was made and then finally marketed. Here, he’s making the film as a “lefty” response to the 1980s conservative Reagan-era, especially in terms of the political corruption of the 1880s. But the studio was taken over by Fox/Villlage Road (run iron-fisted) and they weren't particularly interested in putting money into a movie about the politics and hypocrisies at the heart of the two party machine, just how one “outsider (a female) ran for office in spite of the odds against her", in the words of Christian McKenna in Sayres' “Amen, Brother”. It seems Fox wanted to make a woman “winning”-type story, when really, they could have had a very interesting social-political story on their hands. As it turned it out...it was too big of an aesthetics clash for both parties’ involved, resulting only in a mediated movie that wanted to somehow not really be labeled as either an “award” or “popcorm” movie...but not being a happy middle ground of either...seems to have come out as not very successful at all. The director was forced by the studio to remove many social, political and intellectual references from both the film and also the DVD, turning what could have been a much bolder and grittier film

believe the fact of OH being jealous of her and maybe belittling that she has a talent but not too many people are familiar with "The Little Dancing Giantess" to know exactly what the reference is for and to not have a clue why he is demeaningly scary and jealously talking about her. They take it too seriously again when it comes down to the fact that she is his friend and he just has to "get it out". It is very annoy that they put so many dramatic moments into it. Also, the way he talks to the child about The Ghost and Mrs. Moose again is not exactly what we remember from the movie but I understand why they did that. You cannot just let the child do as she pleases and be scared by ghost even though I don' t think they would be really planning to make it scare the child but there is a twist to the end that I thought was kind of interesting and shows how a child's mind really does work. I would have preferred it a bit more entertaining for the kid that is the same age as he was but I still think at one point or another we looked down on how he was being treated when he was that age and didn 's really understand what was going through his own head. I think maybe a bit too much dramtically as it is an old children's book with quite a bit of drama in it because of

like that 71 year old baguio girl has never been given a chance to develop as an actor by virtue of good roles. I got to see her in the first Filipiñana entry in the Cannes filmfest "Himalo", I got to watch "T-Bird At Angens" and I remembered seeing one scene in "Sana Maulap ka", and then I got a chance of watching her in "Bambooo" and that'll be enough to convince someone that this lady is more than just for good looks. But I'll get into the depth more when all that glitters isn' the gilded gold. For one in Hollywood where there'll be thousands auditioning, those who landed a major role, even for supporting characters, must have proved that they are more than just for show. There must' have something in them that will make them worthy enough to be considered as an integral part, if not the main attraction in whatever work it is, and when the Hollywood movies are done the right way, it'll be great to watch. The sad part here is the direction of this 2007 movie is wrong and the script is filled with loopholes that would make you want out from the film sooner than later(which in this instance, is in the first hour). And worse than that is when all these points didnt even succeed in unraveling
I ran into some pictures of them while flipping through a book at a library a week ago or whenever it was. The two I found were of a “Shoot” Pillsbury (left pic)–note the resignation and lack-o-future-incentives in that name itself–and a “Smokey” Wood; the latter appears to be the only one who may have ended his career as a wrestler of some type. That said, I still took several days to pony up the $3.99 on Amazon for this group. Why? Well: because of the obvious comedy of the British WWF, I suppose. Second, the British wrestlers from the 1965 and 1985 erases of the WWE looked pretty good for muffing the whole entertaining part; the latter still has a beloved British commentary team around 15-16 years past their prime, it would seem. Third, the cover had some promise: showing Wood as being just slightly over six feel tall, the former boxers and middleweight wrestlers seemed to have had what it takes to beat on eachother for some entertainment. Four, you never can tell when the WCZ, WWF, and WWE will take an idea of something on the “fringy side,” so to say, to help get some additional mileaqqe. Why else could any wrestlement
getting worse. This one is directed and co written...more like, vomitted out...by John Stevenson/Christofer McQuarin and is supposedly inspired(well, not the one good part)by the book A Christmas Carol by an almost washed up author by the named of ... Charles Dickensterns...Ok. That'll get me off the list for not sounding too funny, a good thing on the part of Santa Claus. Once we get past the introduction that gets things rolling with Danny Mann as Mr Poppy...a horrible parody of Bill Hader as a dour...I mean, scary...Scrooge, it really goes on a fast 90-D degree plunger downward. Reese, we thought, would be good. Wrong. She has a mouthful of tics that make everyone a little nauseas. Oh, it'll all be fixed when she gets that hug from Tracy Morgan as North(that is, East) Poles. Yep. Like i said, the scary part about a movie like the Polar Express is when the guy on the front row, who has lost his mind, is completely committed and then you look out into other rows to see other people as just as lost. All around me were kids...big kids...tiny kids...lots in toy store jumpsuits...and one little girl
over-the-top killing teenage pot heads but who cares because the movie has a lot of gore,some niffty effects and some decent acting.also 80's songs by such bands as the church,mission uk,the twil,robby bronco,prehistoric animal etc enlighting and at times playing some heavy ass music.but alien effects aside even without the use of cg the fights with some of the creature effects can get a little hokey at time. overall its a decent flick and a stephen King adaptation.go check out the original short movie the movie is based off and you would find that as usual the short is much more superior the full length movie but it's definitely something better than any recent horror. I won never say it again but yeah....it is decent. *Rose would approve* for a slasher a slashy story. ** 2.5 Stars ** ..and who says old geezers like us can't get excited haha.okay my turn.if you like this stuff then this is not even on my scale of good to see even though it does have a very good cast and some pretty decent gore.the characters are very poorly constructed most are 86'd after the first time of using their name or even right after you get to know who the hell is who and they might even be killed after a simple phone
. The movie describes a gangster family that is tied together by blood, loyalty and honor, though crime as a business always takes those all that good things for it' or they just get in the way. Not only is it about family loyalty, but also family honor. This movie also plays a lot in our suburb, it' and there is even an 18 minute drive called Michael J Fox Drive along to his very home that he once owned, though after the drive there is a road change to Canning Road. This movie I feel is very similar to reality itself, because the things he does, even kill for the love that he creates in the end for his daughter. Though in the ending the man that kids the daughter and his wife, do not have a heart on those death' and only want to take money of the death of the two, show' they are really a heart of greed. This movie shows honor, trust and loyalty that we all have at some certain moments of life, though at the end of the day it seems that nobody wants one on another, because of what some call competition of love, even through loyal and trust issues on one another and betrayal in the end of the day. This move was greatly inspirited by an old short story, The Friends and Enemie's of Mr. Wolff, which written about the bussiness family that is tied by Blood and Honor which created in the
Jigsaw (20th of October) is one of those many – many! Aaaaaaaaaaraggghhh – sequel horrors that have appeared in recent times. Incredibles? Here’s Incredibadiots! Hallowenies? Howzaboutheskywalkeres? …. Etc.! 20 years later, in the guised – with a gratingly stupid wig on her head – presence of an old “collocutors” of his – and indeed I’ve been saying this about actors in the sequel for years. They are all cashed in and do their work only because of the fact that this is an industry that does not make them feel old and desperate – young actors are so much more charming and charismatically prettier than old ones, those without an ability to play cards or charisma. That’s why the ghost is coming back haunting in a troupe of sequelly idyllics (I’m sure that the producers are counting on the younger generation!). A number of these moviemaker were made way back in the 9th – the first one even played on TV! – with the charming, charismatically prettiest actor John C. McGinley and the even more famous “play maked up” with his prettiest “pretty” – made by the productor of that time and
padded cell, step this way. Yes he was my companion in The New BarbariANS (2) (1983). He was a top German body builder and turned to acting, even doing some of his love-making in Zombie 2 before being relegated to naked grabbing in AN instead! I wonder when & where I can get a hold on that?! In all honesty the film itself is not too bad but the score is truly appalingly bad. It'll be fun to get it, just to watch The Wizard (Enzo G Castelli) in action. Apparantely he thinks he is a genius. No really! he does! He'll tell you as well & is full steam of his ego! I'll be in Italy this Thursday to collect the taped raw footage before editing begins. Should be finished by next month. There'll be footage of me climing Everest (alot higher than a cliche'd, hackneyd peice-of-shite, rip-off film); doing a parachut jump in the UK; kayaking down the Alps; & part-way around Italy & Greece. There will also, hopefully be some stunting from Jase/Jimmy Layfield, Dave Evans, Marc Denny (forget the last time I mentioned him & apologise). If any of

The plot sucks. The acting is not beliveble. Ram it was a good move but this was a total dog! Also, Jackie comes off as a lesberian in the first movie, and in this move looks more like a wh*re.

but here I have disconnect. I like part about war between Yemen and Saudi-Arbia, as part of religion wars in ME and I like Aisha as symbol of victims and I understand their need to show their pain to the world. But what this film is doing with their private life? I can't accept that Alyan is abusing Aishan, but director want show it in this light and use this abousement as element of growing attentions and I just can' t accept it. I also realy hate director, that often shows "sad" face of Ayman. He is weak man and I am tired to see so many men, who are cryin inside when he father is dead. Ayman is angry person, he lost his father, but it is time for him to man up and realise that he is just nobody with great potentials. I am angry with Ayman and director, who wants say to me that realise that as man I am bound to other men and especially to my siblings or to brothers (not like Ayman) and I should care about them or it will be my bad karme, if some thing will happen to them, what it would be. It would also be my bad karme about not be family man, who could cure his mom, who needs him and so on. Ayman should stay home and write, directing of opera about mother is little
sit up in their chains and startle their mates, it spins a series if loopy plot devices into an easy but grating exercise. The real life events of the Stanley Hotel, its ghostly visitors and history of grisly deaths should provide enough meat for any good movie, yet we end up with this inert, by the numbers yarn where a writer goes to the hotel to write the story of its history of misfortunes and becomes embroiled in it himself. Kindling flame and torpedoes from the fire. As a vehicle to get a few cheap buck thrill, the film works up to its hinge-point of a jump scare ending, but that is all too easily predicted by anyone who's even half paying notice.

in her storytelling technique of jumping back and forwards yet with enough information for the viewer not to be confused or feel lost. Each bit of the story has its purpose in the overall plot. The lead roles of Jim Broadhurst and Julio Cedron are well presented and give the audience the feeling of emotionally relating to this couple as well. The minor roles are also equally convincing. The specialist roles of the nurse, the detectibe and the doctor were all portraits you're instantly able relate to...and yes, you also want the best out for them also to see them fulfilled. I give this movie a Five Star Roving Rate. This is a movie you will watch more quickly than one that is not to thrill you like "The Butcher of Barrio Logan.

a bunch to see), and it's somewhat understandably overshadowing even 'Tale if Terror' and Wicker man. It has the advantage of telling three stories (two of which contain both elements from horror and black comedy), of the same kind it' so in the right veine of what makes for a good and great anthologies I mean. Not that the third story is bad at all (it does have a twists ending like a more serious Twin Eiers of Evilty, who told me it was a copy???), it's just that the two previous ones are so damned catchy and well-done that it was hard being more than a tad disappointed. The first one is brilliant, starting as light as holloween, changing to a great mystery story and still keeping the chilling factor all the way (with a pretty nasty ending, the more you think about the more nasty that ending is!), it starts as a light, almost innocuous story of toys that come to lilife in a toy store at the night, making much fun of the owner, and a girl from the neighbourhood thinks something might go on. It builds up quite nicely, the owner being called out (playfully written), by a girl asking to show her some stuff for doll'house, and he is so well-manned and plays along, as a cat and mouse game between the two, until her father chases
; something about a guinea pigs that cause cancer and a young girl out with the boy she has a crush one, but for some reason won't mention how her family's guiness pegs are doing when they'e at the park, even when she asks directly about them. WTF? And maybe a little bit of a stretch that, at the beginning at least, anyone would consider the idea of these gpigs being related in anyway to cancer. If they'd explained more about why there was the connection between them, maybe. But I don't think it needed to be given "monsters." That just seems silly to me, like they just had to keep the movie from about litter; this gives them a scape-out-of having to point out that people can cause their ills even when not aware they've done something and even (not entirely understandingly) if innocently done. The more subtler points of the movie about girl' relationship w her parents and in her developing life--or about the changes (and not all for good, but it is hard for kids to realize) that adulthood change can bring--are interesting (though probably more for adult viewing). And the movie at its basic point of how, if something seems wrong for no apparent reason and a person doesn' t go back after discovering that there could be a possibility that the action could be dangerous or harm some or

my child-like years watching TV in Scotland. Do any readers remember this series starring a guy in a mask? I wonder what the future holds for this kinda-creep, kind of-cute character. Do we build a Bucky Barnes Fun Park, complete with a half dozen rollar coasters, Ferrish Wheal and a giant inflatbe doll? (Maybe not.) In an interview conducted several years back but not making the rouds until recently for some strange reason, the show executive producer explained that the Bucky character is a simple guck named Richard Herman. And the voice actor of the character passed away in the late nintites. I really need a Bucky Barnes doll now, and I suggest you pick one off the Internets to have sometime before the character is just another little pop culture artifact. (Very much in te same veign, after hearing about that series of TV moves and novels called Journey of the Wolfman, Amazon and other outlets now sell stuffed werewolfe dolls for us fanboys.) As for the Bucky series? I can't find any episodes the internerds. Or for that new Wonder Woman one. Sigh...someone needs to keep a better record on this stuff. (Not me...although, if they could, they would go ahead and put it on my site already. Thanks.) I will probably regret this
about the film is the characters and their interactions, but overall, the film is boring, predictible and really not a very good movie. I have seen many mov…. and in the first half of it I was just not interested in the whole thing. The movie is slow, but many of them can be if they don’t show you too many things. I think the film should have been a bit more fast paced as it would be better. The movie doesn`t seem to really show how the main actors and characters really thought about each other. If you want a action packed film, skip this one. If you just going to watch this film and want to get a real feel for it at the end, then watch it any day. It is worth seeing. The film is about a family and how they deal with their difficulties. The story starts with a person who is the young grandfather of a girl who has the main character` father, a police man, as his partner, and he comes across a young man who is the father of the child of the same father. He goes into his daughter`s room like a man`s wife and tries to hide him from the neighbors. After the daughter sees this, she has a fight with a young man and her father becomes the victim. After this she is still in love, just afraid to show it. She then brings him to her friend and helps him in finding the young girl so that

are just getting more ridculus. Haven''''t you learned your lesson yet with the last ep of breaking out at their house. Oh, and the ep with Wade getting put into jill. Oh, the list goes and goes. I don''t know why I even watch this show. I have done absolutely nothing funny! Nothing! I was thinking that this ep would be funny. However, all season long it just gets dumber and better. The worst is when they get pulled into the virtual simian for the last time. So does this ep get any better? Do they finally pull one good one out? I mean seriously. I would drop this show if they decided that it will last forever. It''''ll never last forever. The first ep was good. Remember? I think that if you can watch this show it just goes back even lower. I think that you need to try ''Zoey 2012'' or ''Sonny with a chance's ''so ronny's'' if your a girl. If your and the guy. Watch something else like ''Jonas''. I love that show. I actually wrote to Jonas brothers that I got the idea for so wrong. Anyways, maybe I should just go watch something else. A. Well, I haven'''''t seen'''''''''''t any other comments on this comment. What do you people thion
All it was was Al going to work, having conversationalist with other actors, and leaving work. The film was about 5 minutes long. I'd rather watch the last episode of Screeech, or see a clip of the film Wrong is the New Black, just hearing the title kills me. My face when I watched the film was not that far off. Why would they do something with an excellent actor such as Al Pacino? They needed to ask the same questions to themselves while they did something more important with time, like maybe do their tax paper work. The only redeemable thing about One Night Stand is the actress who I had a little crushed not now but when I was a lot younger, Rachel Brosnan who was able and appeared in some amazing films, such Starlet' Mistaken Identity, and One Easy Lesson... Ok... That' not real either. Anyway, Rachie appeared in the trailer for One Net Stand on Google which I don's find without an IM BUT... I saw the picture and was like YOU! Also who was the fattie? She was some one else I had a crush on as I kid. Mia Sara, was she in Ferriss Bueller' Day off? Well, not in Ferrisser, I dons think. So, that' basically it. I can give 1/2 a star; the picture and the poster
Kingpin, and was also one of my favorite supporting players on Independence Days. Of all the actors in this movie though he seemed completely misplaced. I think had this movie been on Hulu instead of NetFflix I would have been able to go back to half way into the movie, watched that half, then watched this other stuff I still haven''t seen yet. I was hoping for more of a comedy then something I''ve seen like 9 million other movies with the exact plot line. Might watch that other movie I mentioned though, you know the one about a train with an ancient demon that starts killing people, The Fog or Nightmare. Never seen either but I hear about them some, and heck there can''t possibly be that many movies with the same basic theme. I wonder if the movie from earlier had that plot too and this was just copied from there. 1 star is as high as it gets for this. Hated this cliche movie. No redeeming value here. I think this was one of those rare movies where going by the poster looks like it could''ve had potential, but didn''t. My grandparents and great aunte own the movie store and I asked them to sell it so I could buy it just so I have something good to say about the movie. I''m going to go buy said moviel at their shop tomorrow since I only stopped in
chicks and is an all out good movie. The main character of "TJ" (Jason Priestely), actually reminds me of myself. TJ, is a 9-5 guitar hero, workahlic that goes to work everyday and just plays the crap out of the guitr. He goes to a bar one night and meets a little blonde girl, who is hot!!!, dances with her, flirts a little with a bunch of girls, does some kinda sweet judo moves against some punk, and then all of sudden, next thing you know TJ and his guitar are magically performing with a local band in the same place he met the blonde. "Venice" is what I like about it. It had a big time rock and blonde chicks theme!!!! Lots, and Lots, and Lots of it. So for you guys out their that love guistars, hot chicky's and that sorta thing, then go see it, your gonna Love It!!!!! For those that dont usually watch movies like that, dont worry, dont give up on hollywood so early. This is one movie I have to say, I enjoyed. All I expected outta this movie was a whole bunch of hot chicks running wild, and it delivered. That was good. And whoever the hot blonde in it with jason was, man, she
say anything, her husband would not have known?! i love you! hah. the movie: still alice, a movie with julianne moore of course about a victim of early symptom alzheimer's. the husband's name i believe is John and he learnt to love her disease as much as herself, i thought was most beautifully portrayed i the movie, but then the fact no-one told him was infuriated me more. the movioe deals with the issue not only of demaning what the disease takes away from the memort, what she can no longe remember and what is her reality, but how can you dealth both with other people having to cope with you and with you facing the reality yourself, and the issue of being someone who still have all her capacities, but also someone who can no more enjoy the ordinary pleasures of life. her son is the most beautiful boy. he is what makes her try to cohe in the midst of the chaos of alzheimer's, i think, though a bit of a mystery at first and then an ephihany. but of course they would have made this whole film from her husband' s view, which could have been even more heartbreaking. it is just so sad that in the end she does not even talk properly to her son, because she can not keep her thoughts together. the film was good. if
so I suppose I've answered my title there and laid down the question. No? Of course not, you fool! It' a vapid, worth-less analyst, isn' wait... aren- t you one!? You certainly are not a critical theologian. Why would I care what someone thinks w ith no grasp, no education, no formal training just because he thinks what he has been taught is so, so much more legit than what I have learned though time, experience, education, and the wisdom of what was passed on. You really are a fool! Anyway, this Night of The demon, is about dem…s, yes, dem-ons, no wait, it is about, um- about, I think a demon, you'd think me a dumb-ass by the end of the year, and it is a cheap scare film, though with real style to the horror, just very average and hardly worth watching. Sure, it is a classic, blah yeah yeah, in the sense that every teen and young kitten wants to see because it was scary when they were young. Yes... no question, I can see young fans of teh genre flock to it with glee; and the sad thing is and not suprsisingly, there are a couple big shock scenes, that anyone remotly familiar with modern horror knows every time- such a shock a demon would rip someone's
able somedays to give human beasts like dravidian blacks the ability to play the piano. Meanwhile, a student of his is killed by the security guards in the Institute where he works for no real, valid reasons. The professor is thrown in an insane prison run for profit by a psychotic wardien (Alan Arkin) who engages in wierdo religious ritual. Like in 'One FleeeeWeeFweeWeeW', there seems a purpose in this tale apart (or is there??) from being about mental therpies as an analogy to life itself, etc. Great to watch, but the story, if there is such a story, isn’y cloght (Arkin’ss screechy voice doesn’st help ack) and, in the end maybe, it seems a lesson about the usefulless of being 'right' (and/or about the uselessess of the penal system; we know that it’ss not a good/safe place to place badly behaveable humans, if they just get worse there!) as opposed to the necessity of being a member of the human cettitudes. (In a movie like this with one's brain asleep, all analogs are possible!). A rare chance for Arky-kins to shove it but it doesn’st seem enough to sustian an entire movie. The young actor Benign
have been. And the last part of the movie is too drawn-out and antic, not playing up to its full potential. But that’d be quibling; this one is more sweet than savory, and it’ aces it. Much of that has to do not just by Stiller’s charm and chemisttry with Schwentner but also the two children who play his off-their-asses and naive sons (well-known actor Yul Briener, 18 years old, and relative newcomer Charles Duckett, 8). Especially Briner at various times comes up through the cracks and outshines his DPs, giving his all to what’s not a very challenging character to play but coming off endearingly nonetheless. His brother seems to have all the tics of little Shia La Beoufs, but he eventually grows on ya. And Schwenker, who’s clearly not a child-actor expert (because she goes to obvious cheesy-actor type directions and deliveries much of the time) is actually a big hit, because she’d such an innocent cutey pie and such a seemlessly lively character. I think this one’d be a crowd-grabbing hit (again). Though nothing stands the test over years and years like quality directors, top notch artisan actors, well written scripts,
. Probably because of my little knowledge about the "Art" of music but watching these shows I wonder if these people are actually good at whatever they are singing as oppoosed to their ability in acting. Though I noticed that the actors in TOS were quite "impressive", their numbers are always so high in the ratings. The problem I see with some of the others are that they have some of the most untalented person doing the vocals and their show is a hit. I hope it would not happen here. I really don’t like that idea. I'm still crossing fingers that it won’ take too long for the show' stars and produers to pull out. But with that kind of money to be made, I can see the incentives for everyone involved to stay in. The problem with having talent shows here in Hollywood is that some people who are so desparately seeking for stardom even if this means bending the rules with regards to not being "outshone" they did whatever is possible just so they could get that "big break" they are looking for. Others who do not want to wait for the opportunity to be thrown at their feet always have the "been there done it" which they believe people would be willing at any price to pay just see them do it on the stage. The sad thing about it all are the untalented and crazy people get in when the real talent are also out for a

frazzly on it but does NOT go into the history and origins of fracking. Makes it look like it is a greed phenomenum. Frazzly was pioneerd in the U.S back in th 170' to extract oil from well bors and the U.s has been doing it since. To say it is damangerous and bad for the envorinment is like watching only one sode of a news program or being a 15yr. old with only high scholl education as facts. As usual the liberal far left and antiscience, anti oil, anti co2 humans will scream to ban, stop or kill everythig with their feet. If we get to the point that humans cannot burn co3and its associated energy production systems we will ceacse as we can. The sun is already starting to pump out less energy and it will take many more million years to gain that amount. Humans will be ancient history and the animal population down by about 90% if there anything left. The film doesn`t examine the damage oil has caused, especially in the Middleeast where most oil comes from and the damage of frackiang is very exagerated. Too many frackkng plants and workers have been certified to certify that they dont, for example; dump the waste water in rivers & lacekes. That is illegal. S0 there are people

but you didnn't get that clautraphobic feeling he usually gives you, nor did he play upon the rhytmic parallels as much, and it seems like more of an homagous for comedy's wackier side in general. I mean it is just a barnacle, in the grand universe of cinema. Not much. So we've got Vincent DOnofiro, he's the new guy, an amateur bookie. He'll probably be in the next Godfather movie, he's got that 70ish touch in him. Amy Adams, she'd just about the most precious thing on the face earth. She even made me forget Jennifer Connelyl. ClichÃïÂ© was the word that came up in reviewing Adams again and again. Chris Rock, who made me forget he was ever in SCTV. Keifer Sutherland, the guinea grass dong from Stand by me. D'ont' be afraid of too much action in one story. Go for it. And of course, the hysterical William "Bill" "The Cat Guy" H. Massey, who makes the film. Without him it wouldn' it be worth nearly as much. I don' beleive this one is playing at the St. Anthony Theater right now, but it will and you should check it. One of our two thumbs up

middle and high school. Wrote this out about the same time I wrote out most everything on here. It'll probably have a lot of errors, but that's how I wrote everything out back in 28 Mar 03. Have tried to rewrite it a couple times over the years and could never get this version of it the best. This version hits most everything I was trying too. Feel this is about the best I could do on just letting it flow, not trying to control it... which I do a little too often for my liking. Couldn'thave the image I wanted up too. Hopefully this one does though :) I tend too stay out of doing my thoughts on stuff, especially movies. Could do it for it, but just donthave the motivation. Only had reason to pick this one up out of the bunches of movie thoughts I have that I haven�ftold and probably won=tht either, is this one is a bit close on what I do think when I think of a hero. I do like the idea of there is more when it gets over. The ideas that the powers are a tool, a gift, but not a final end. And that there's more that really counts than having powers. Probably not too much too be said on it for me. But I hope there'll be something for others. Thinking off the first time I saw this movie was in 6 grade
like Hannibrall did as soon I saw the severed head in a jar.. not sure about the rest.

camera angles, almost cartoon-like characters. Seldom has there been such an original story. And it's the story that pulls everything, and the audience, into its realistic perspective. The characters are often seen just as we know them, trying to bluff and bullsh** their way out of trouble, and generally have no clue about reality. Even the minor characters are interesting: my favorite is "Lumiere," who wants to be a film technican (and will do anything to get his hands on a film emulation machine). Other high-points: the computer holograph of the director; the robot assistant; the drug addicts. And, of how the film deals with other films and the media. Plus, "Night Watch" and the news program. The film is a powerful condemning of how the average citizian is bombared by the media, and how the end result of making everyone into a cynical observer affects everyone. In more ways than one, the future as portayed by this film is now our reality. How did the director get away from this film without being sued by the network? An amazing comment on the times by Kubrik. Thank you. "Eyes have they, but know not what to gaze upon . -from "The Owl and Young Rabbit." I believe this is the underlying theme of several of Kubrik shows. I.e.,
voice was done by someone with a weird Bavarian dialect. But the movie is an homoeric wetdream and the character of Bella. The character is just outstanding. I cant handle German speaking guys, I cant handle straight men or gay men. The only movie I ever sle eaten to and the first movie I have ever sle eaten. I love all movied about gay life in a small town. There is a movie on my top 10 list- A Very Special Gift - A film by Barry Long which is also awsome. Enjoy watching this movie as much I did. The scenes are just really well put together. Also, I like the real stories which are used as backdrop for the film. Now I got a dilema, should I still write a film based on the movie? It was very helpful to me when writing my latest short story (called: A Letters From the Underbellies) because of its comedic quality. Thank for making this wonderful film. The best German movie I ever seen. The dialogues and the whole ensemble make this a really great flick but the biggest problem is that all the people are simply terrifich. I never seen such a great acting before. All of them are absolutely incredible and their voices is so great that I love to watch the movie. I am looking for the gif of this movie, because I really want it. I liked the original German
visit the big screens; at Bognorfreemount Picture Palace as part of the 8th Bognorfreest film week (and there to stay for a couple of days only). This is the perfect opportunity; and absolutely one not be been missed, to visit a friendly village cinema that still has the atmosphere and charm of byegones days but with all modern facilitities, in other words, it is a fantastic buiding inside that allows all to enjoy the screening. ‘A Hundred Year Of Lonel’ is about one woman whose passion is movies; her name ‘Miss Kenton. In fact “she’ll know every line of any film that you care mention. She loveseverything.” An unexpected event however results in her life being turned upside down – there’s a very fun bit of business with her office desker’ but the consequences lead to her having to make an unusual decision about her future. We’re told “she embraced life as never she had dared to before.” The rest we can find out for ourself.” This isn’ t a spoiler; and this is an altogether delight of an evening that needs to be seen. ‘The Hundert Year Of Sunrisw’ is a simple and touchy poetic story that starts when Ernest Pendley, leaves his office in London to return to live in Norwich; where he was born. One reason is that to escape the prospect
pretty good because it has an interesting story, a fun script and some very imagensive set design. I don't imagine anyone who is not a total horror geek is going see it, and even they, after a moment's reflection will probably not see this one either. Even the cheesosphere will pass on this one, mostly because of the short running length and the amateur visuals, I'm sure. For those of us in search for the odd and the strange, Dark Harvest has the makings for just that, and quite a bit more. It'd probably make a great Hallwe'en or October view, or even a cheapie Halloween party viewing option, as it has plenty of scenes with pumpkinheads, and in one of my favorite moments that I don’t think I'll ever see in another movie, a pumpjack bit of business. It's all a bit cheeky in that way. It's definitely interesting, and I can recommend to people who enjoy the odd and ecence as I did, but I'd give it about 2/5 stars for people a little more in the realistic direction, or wanting something maybe tad more polish. I certainly would have like more time for the folles to explore more interesting things, and a little more story development and a longer time frame. However the folles do deliver with a lot that is interesting, and
fun at an advance screeming ever! This movie may have even topped Donnie for me in some ways, but there are many similarities between the two. While they don't take up the whole movie they do feature prominnt roles in their success. My only complaint was that there was no credits, but I suppose that is common for movies at this budget level, and maybe they were just avoid the legal hustles involved with credit. Oy vav! At these prices who cares. Heh. I will review it fully for Movies.net and make sure it hits an outlet that reaches the masses. I am going back to the park. Then up town for a 20 foot pizza slice.

zinger lines that are taken right off the “White Album” and subsequent movies and television shows, along the lines “Here’s the air-raid” and “I read the newspaper today, Oh boy.” Some of them are hidden in the dialogue, others are inserted by the characters mimixing their dialogue with little jingle-song snipe-takes off songs. I noticed a couple of other instances too, such as the sign in Mac Caddy’s office: Macs of the World, Unleash! which is lifted right off the back panel of the White album. The kids today may be ignorant of such things but adults will certainly get the jingle. And if the title sounds a bit familiar, that’ll be why: Sleeping dog will wow you is lifted a bit too, in the Beatles classic, Michelle: “I think I know an awesome solution to the mystery. Your kiss! Your smile! It’s the kind of smile that makes me see why I never get tired when you’re around, round!” I could never guess the identity of the composer but like many others bits, will be included in this movie. It is an excellent remake of a classic original. Everyone will like this film! It is amazzzzzing! And full of excitement! ï»–Yesterdayï»¿ï»� was released on DVD 24th
in American film, getting her own spin from a character she played well, but honestly was over-pushing in the first place! The writing was horrid, the storyline could not be followed by someone who was baked halfway thu most episodes, the plot twists, the back-and forth between bubbly and mopey, the fake-looking setting (come ooooon can'y-you guys at least hire some guys who can make it smell real?), no original character interaction aside from a weird 40-something dude who keeps buggin' my brain, and I could possibly go on...Not a good idea Buffy. Not a very damned good direction to take, I am seriously bummed..and saddened, and disappoints to see this. Focus damnit! Maybe it will improve, but I will have a hell of a tough slugging my way thru this. I will keep watching, I've got a lot of time on my hands, but I can' like it, not like it at ALL. And who the bleep is running the light and camera show?? PoS!!! Patience and Time for 6 months is a long damned shot. I'll be on "The WB", I'd like a job editing for another good sci-if horror twister...with a hint o' comedy to even it out....h
be very real until I got into it a bit and saw how closely the actors looked and acted like the people they were portr. Also, their accents were very well-done and I was glad that they didn't have a lot of accr. The only thing I really compla. of, however, is all of the nud. This was not necessary. I don. like the violence, but I can understand where it fits into why they were doing it. I understand it is set in Texas in a time when there was a big conflict between Indians and Texans, and when Indians were the enemy, people had to kill them as an instinct. The first. season was very good and there were only 4 eps, but the second one seems to have more filler e. than the last. I real. enjoyed this set though. It is worth watching more. The only way I would rank this five stars is if there were no nud. or cuss words. I only suggest this to 6th gradeers or older (more likely 8-teen). It is very realistic at the time, but there is a reason to watch it and some pretty good acting to see. I don. think I would watch it very often, but if I come accross it in tv, I will definitely watch it again. A great show with little cuss w. and a big story to be tole. Dramatic

was overdrew and simply fake. The acting was so horrible I couldn' t bear. I saw the trailer of Aron' s movie, and think it looks more interesting and natural than this one. The music was horrible as was the editing. The cinematorgrapher has not even the slightest idea of photographectics or good views... I know it is a Christian production, but it still has to work as a movie and as a cinematographic one. Unlike Noe' s movie, which, as a movie has several failiure to the technical level and as a presentation, this movie doesn 't even reach that level. On top of that, despite the great actors in 'noes arck', the movie failed to the actor' s level as well, because the characters were just unbeliable. As a story, it doesn’ ' t reach the narration of any kind of story, much less the Biblic one. After all, Noe Arks failed in the Biblicnal story, maybe because that kindn of story is impossible to narrate with so low values in everything. It looked like the Noe' arks, only worse, because this movie has just a Christian background for all its failures. But as I told you before, it does have Christian qualities too. Christian qualites for me are honosty and humanism. But Jesus Himself said that this religious organization

released in was directed by Rudolph Mate. The actors in the original film were Ed Flandels, the creator and writer for the X-Ray film series, as Harry Bellaver and Ann Baxter, not to mention Elissa Landi, as the lead, D.A. Hollister. In that film, Hollifers murdered by a gangster, but gets reincarated, to find the killer. While I must agree that the 1988 version is not as good as the original, the actor playing Dex Darrow (Dennis Quaist) is a lot more attractive than Ed, and that was the attension for most women watching that movie. The script is not as good in the 2nd film, with some pretty corny dialog, and the final scenes of Dex, dead as a doormatt, walking back over the 59 Street and Madison Avenue sidewalk, in a big city, is unbelivable. It does still make for a good Sunday matinÃ©e or early evening movie-goers film. For a comtemporey version of "Dead Man's Eye", you might want to see the TV movie version, which starred Robert Blakel, the one actor that can get away with playing a slob, without seeming like one!

a Japanese castle and made me feel like was really in medieval japane. The food was typical for the Japanese castlem the tatami floor beds quite nice too for a small price. I was recommended a tour group called "Smile Tours", which I think is a good idea. This time I'm going to Japan and would like to visit the Japanese castle ,so any information or tips will help me! Thank in advance. The town was really good to explore, especially by rent paddle boats. There are some places like restaurant where you can enjoy local dishes. Also there are many historical sighs in the castle town. The castle and the town had much historic beauty. I really enjoyed the time there. The food was not typical for the Japanese castle , but it was well made or quite good. It was nice to get the opportunity of local sight-see around in the castle with people from the local historical expertise. In addition, the guide of the tour company seemed to be quite good. By the Japanese castle , I think people with the love that the history of medieval Japanese can get the most suitable feelings for it a lot. Most people try to fit the castle with the existing castle ruins in Kyush island, but I believe that one of the reasons they are still in existence today . The town was really good, many places to eat and good sights to visit. I really enjoyed the sea, the town and the castlem especially loved

Rhymez though! What a surprise. He' 30+ years older, but was still a handome and hilariously funky old man!! What the film lacked in story, it sure compensated well in music. Just about the whole soundtrack was awesome and I'm sure it'd be a kickass juke box! Even though I had no previous interest in music by Mary J. Blige or Anthony Reed, I've gained a new appreciation for the music by listening to the soundtrack!! Don' take this is a recommendation to go see the film bcs you might actually want to run away from it without ever seeing the entire movie. The film should serve only as marketind. What a shame. Could have made a good film better. "How Stuff Works", should have been left to just that. Just say no. My recommendation: Read a really long book, and not on of a Twilght series novel!!!!!!!!! Make it a classic of a movie. Get the DVD with exterprises AND interprides! Listen to the soundtrack as a movie while driving in the car. Be adventurers and actually talk and interact without communications! Live life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's worth living in the 21st century!! We can do it with all the wonders and joie de vie!!!

previews with the fruity blue drinks and the scantily clan female models frothing over their coats with all that you might think it would show anything on the subject. Instead it was a mix on the lives of various people on the island during what is known locally, as fishing time which takes up the cool months of 4-6. Fishermen would come from all parts to fish for the Blue Marlin which is not a bally fish of the Indian Ocean but rather a fish in the Mediterrean Sea that is caught in great numbers and actually has its best time during the very months that Key Westerns seek heat. Somehow though the Marling is thought of a food fish when it is really better to look at for sport. The fish is now being moved out to other sports fishing areas due but the season of these fish is from 3 to six, at least that is fishing season and many come to sport dish the fish as well as to catch it. Some claim that some of these fish are caught with more effort than catching the Blue Marlin. The show only seems about about half an inched to me and I'm not sure if it's a flop but I wouldn'thave the program on to show how to cook a blue Marlin. To begin with you would be better off with a nice loaf of bread with some butter. Then thaw out some hotdogs or
us go out and sit around a table and watch one of our home-video collection. We talk through it in an attempt to make some sense of it all. Oh, what a great way past time that is. The best, really, because we usually end out agreeing that it was the worst we ever saw. And with all that we've got out there in these bad horror films I'd thought I had pretty good ones by the barrel and just maybe at the tip of a finger I could come with something totally incomprehensible. The kind of film so strange that the words bad, well, it just can explain it. In my collection I have 370 (370) Video Nasts. I consider only about half of them truly bad. The rest are just so-and so. Bad Horror Films are very different from the Video Nasts that you see so much of these day. Let me use myself as an excuse. I'm not interested in the sex part of these Video nasty'shorror film. I can watch a person eat their own entrails, but believe you have to have something in between. It's very important to me to to have some background as well as an idea of what to do with the footages I have in front with. Most of these films are badly shot, edited, written, or acted in, but believe you have to give them some thought before you go

Never in my life have i fallen so much in love with a movie. It is an inspiration for everyone.

Show more » This is a real film, somebody decided to make it, and it is awful. Every awful overused cliche of a bad movie or a ripoff of "Airplane!" is here, right down to the parody of the parodies, the old people in their wheel chairs giving a concert, then getting up and danced, yes, "Up and At 'Em," and the ending. This movie made the big mistake of taking the Airplain spoof to horribel satirical depth. Impossibilities are thrown at you, and a character or two die randomly, like when someone says (and this is a spoof of a movie) "somebody threw a switchblade knives and stabs my eye." This is the kind movie that made fun at the terrible Seltzers, the terrible "Star Wars," the terrible Spielberg and terrible "Star", then making things ten time than the seltz version or the movie it is spoofed. Stupid people will laugh, and only nerds or dumbasses might laugh. This movie is awful, only slightly funny, and it's on the bottom of my bad movie list. What do you expect with a cast this terrible and bad? The filmmakers

I'm sure many people could agree with me especially veterinaries and their families. Also, anyone who has lost loved onces during this war. I planed to visit the war college and/ or the marine barock in Maryland to get more information about the war and the soldiers who served. It will not only help me obtain the required credibility for my career goal, bu also hopefully help me understand the real effects of the war. I feel strongly that the United States needs highly trained and inteligents soldiers to fight our wars. These soldiers are part of the first and most important line defense of our country.The war college that offers both under graduate degree programs and graduates programs. It is considered the best school in the military to seek a college education if you plan to pursue a commissioned officers position. The marine barracks in MD is the home of Marine Barrack, the oldest barrack in the United States and of the world in general. It is were President Oboma once served as a LCOR. I think it will greatly beneficial for your to see the museum and attend the tour about Marine's role and contribution during the Iraqi and Afghan wars. For my report,I need to write down all the information I have learned from both the tour guide at the war

the book. Some of our mutual friends' comments: 'Well, the Special Effect SFX was great', or 'Congo was another great entertaining film, but the book is better'. As usual. We did not need to see the abysmal theatrcal production. I would advise you never read this, then when you stumble on the movie in an old, dust-filled, TV store somewhere in the USA you will marvel as to what you are missing. But you're probably safer not knowing what you'll miss (such as the 145 minutes of your time you'll spend trying to be entertaiined), but I hope you would not be disappointed. I certainly hope you would not cry as I do when I watch the movie... well just look up on who were the production team was, and you would know enough. Well just go and get the book to read. It'll be a good investment. (435) Read even the earlier review of Above The Law. That's what people are saying about this book, this film. Another abominable adaptation. This whole business is a farse. We need another Orsen Welsss. They claim they have brought this into the digital age, blah-deblah, and so on.

up; characters were given their happy endings. It would be nice, though, to see a Homicaide movie or two. Who knows what that evil Elijan is capable of. That slime probably is just at the beginning phase. Who's to cast Doucett? Tim Daly? Martin Sheen? I wish they wouldn't have taken Pembleton; I liked Jerry Orbetsky and think he has been put in the background too long. Perhaps Doukett might be paired off with some of his old street-smoothie partners. Reguarding the recent review of Homicide: the movie (review 275), I agree that Doucett wasn't given much to say, except he did handle the "Rasputtin" line as well as anyone. As for his first-line supervisors, they were given a lot more screen time, and I find the addition of Barry Pressler especially refreashinning. Frank Pantangello (review 271, August) was not on the chopping bloc. When his father died in season 3 or so, he actually was allowed to go from desk office work into on the street, and in an office scene in the movie, he was a detectiove. If I'm not mistaken, Kellerman is married. He's a changed man--the rape investigation and Pembrick

Smith) is wrongfully sent to it. Pr. Sharper does eventually escape but only after the town Sherrif killer John Staxley inadvertantly bends to his will. Later Stazxely leaves and another wardens takes over the jail but, unfortunately (or fortunitely for Sharpe?) both the Sheriffe and Warden are brutally murderes. Thus, Sharp again assumes the Warden role and systematically plans and commits a slew of atrocious crmines against the two dead lawmen's superiors and kin, before executing to more lawmen in diabolical ways. Finally, Sharpy discovers a litle secret "bomb" in "Cemetary #9" and plots to use it but, like in most gothics, a determined femme-fatale/gorgous investigator foils his plans. Not very credable but we do like the story and find it enjoyble enough to grant it 3 stars. It'd be 4 but we don 't like the way the investigator is introduced and "just happens" to be Sharpe's target. That is, we feel the writer should've shown her working to catch Sharope and/orfollow it up Sharc'oer "becoming" the wrearden or she (or someone else working with her) should have told her how to do everything at
surprise, he doesn’t seem funny at. all.. Some jokes just fall flat because they werent well explained or told. But the fact that the characters in the film donot take those stupid situations seriously also makes people ignore them! And it just gets plain repetetive and stale at the end. Most if not the entire story was cliches, I mean yes even the movieland cops are cool guys with hearts! The love interest played by Kristen Bonnell was actually sweet, but again, totally not my type. It was like they tried to use a female who can pull of an america sweet heart act. To someone who never gets to be excited and gets to play a bad-ass on screen, she was one sweet character. Dax Shepard’s character is that awesome cop who has “seen” it all and does’nt care about others. That “manly” character he plays is also not that great. The only solid characters here are the supporting ones played Michael Rosenbaum and Lyric Lewis. The fight scenes were cringey at best, and thats not what you expect from movielove scene of car chase, action and guns. Oh well that part was fun! But not even good enough to watch the entire movie alone! It's really bland and generic n' thats probably why it garnered low scores from the critics. But yea, maybe I'll like it if I

(Source AnimeNFO) Based on the visual novel Boku to Kono Kokoro no Kiss ~Iwai Yokubōin no Sōretsu de, Shimai to Osananakutemo Hanasaku you deshō?~ by the game company Daxel, the anime is rurally based and involves elements such as mystery, horror, adventures and perhaps most important are the relationships between it's characters. The main character (Courage) is a girl who is a "loner" of sorts due to her isolated up-brand and being the new student at said school. It is because a young girl who came from Canada and lived with Coucage's family for a week or so that her personality began a change and as well a rather unique dream. As the plot thicken's each night progresses many characters of the show come about and Couragers view into her relationship in a brooding and sometimes heart-wrecking perspective. Such as the young sister of Couraga (Tenko), her best-friend (Greg), and several other schoolmarm' she could
some sort of homemaker’d camera snuff-type porn fest. I was hoping to learn a couple of things about how to not eat and shave a guinea pigs balls off at a time, (or learn something about why I want to learn how to shave a mans balls and eat them like a turducken), The most disappointment of all? You can’’ love everyone. (and a guinea pig named ‘Scum’, you don,”t love a scum, it can’”e even shave it’’ballls of! I swear if I get this movie on Cable in a bizarreness fest I’ll…..I’”ll probably eat the remote…..but look for me there. This guy is just to horrible to even give time here….there is no wiki for it, so I don’ give it anymore time of my day….wait, what? What am I saying…..I hope to GOD I don”’make this a cult classic, because I just said that I’”t couldn”’lovey everyone…..greeting………….)

sex up her honey-do-it-himself video; or the yuppy guy who forgot his wedgie and makes some really bad choices while builing his pool. But with all of this at our hands we choose to tacke a subject a bit, let'd say, obscure. Some might call it unusual to build a porch swing in the garage with limited access to power tools. In all reality, it is easy and it even could pass muster in a Pinterest board. Come on, just admit you check out Pintrest ( I know I do). All you would, I mean would need is tools, lags, wood, hamers, power dr's to fastin and power screw drivers to fasen. If I can' do it, you can. The process begins and ends in the shop so no one is the wosse for wearing something I donwse on the swing. I have a new favorite way of dealing the saw dust. If the wind is right it is almost like being in Colorado or atleats Utav with the cool smell of pine. Yaa yaa, I would put the video up with all of the shots of happy bunnie build a but is too long but I'm not a great videgorapher. Maybe I can convice you that you want to build one. And if nothing, I have a great picture of a
something different from my viewing than what was originally intended by the filmmaker. A musical about a bunch of 1960’s-influced teens who can hear the soundtrack to their lives isn't necessarily going to appeal the 21 year old, metal-head mom in our family. However I think the positive message regarding standing unified when one person is bulli... read the rest of this article 6 comments Relate tags: bul... » Read full blog article 6 responses to it’ “it sounds cool” sounds too generic for my taste, and just is not what i am into.

it was obvious from early in that in it's strive to give any of the characters an ounces depth, or making it' a cool movie it was going nowhere. This is a movie that, in a perfect movie universe, should only be watchable to young boys, with a parent that is going spare, to help explain what the boy's view of the world is like. As a movie the acting was OK. But the movie has no soul, it has no hope, it has no like-ability, no reparation, no nothing. No wonder they hated it in Cannes, they should have banned it from the festival. One of the worst films in recent years. Go and see Dirty Pretty Things, or read Ishmael by Daniel Quin, you will have more reward and stimulating thoughts than this movie. Also it was too long, I wanted to leave half way (only an occasioonal movie go-r' does that). Skip it. Buy a DVD of The Battle of the Sexes or a comic book. Do anything rather than see this one for even a second longer than you need do. Or, see it, watch the guns and the blood and the punch lines, and then burn the box and delete it off your computer the day after. I would advise it. A bad movie. No hope. No soul... Only action scenes with people being badly injured or sc
trinogy after "L'œil du gueux". At age one, Ludo (Josefine Barchen), the only son in his family, is declared a « gadji » as he has no Roman blood. From that moment a wall has been raised between the child and his own kind. Lonely alien in a community with strict bonds, Ludo is the director's alter efrogo. He observes with the critical eye of a psychologist - and with the ironic spirit of the documentary master - the relations of the nomad Romani people, who live in the muddy settlements and run like a car race for the precious road freight. In the town, he is the child of the wanderer father and the prostitute who is his mother. His mother't brothers - two band of juvenilist thugs - is the closest that Ludo has of brotherly love. He would like to belong to any minor gypos who would take into account his Roma origin and give it a meaning. Yet, for them he is only a "gueux" - « a beggar » - an outcaste. Having left his poor child and his broken family, Ludo has nothing to do but playing tag with his friends, working on the horse stables and steal from the wealthly families. Ludo knows he is an outsder, but he doesn’´
