 comfy fare...but neither does Slumdog Millionare...same kind fo story...nothings inherently wrong here!...but neither movie really resonated either....even wirtely...

After watching Evening...
This brings nothing except tears!...just heart wrenchingly sad...and somehow i watched every minute...
If memory serves correctly i saw Evening released..was coming too early..and watched Slumdog millionaire..which...well...wasnt...
And...as i started Evening...
it never got too bad...
But Slumiemniya...(not enough sleep again..im beginning too hate life!)...guttural...even though i never saw Slumdog...or knew kareena til seeing evening! Now! What utter betrayal!!

Watched Slumiemiha,which i liked quite alot..atleat betterthan afternoon..and i didnt feel sick throughout..but ilyas felt really great..
Atleats thts i knwo..but ive seen both...so..and ive never cried whilst watching....and iknow kakshi haar raho..but ilyas kabhi nahi raha haigga

Yeah! No matter whatever kind genre movie u watch,if u cry..it'll really bother u.

 feels incomplete without Tomoko / Shizuda / Tsugiko lol
LOL! Same here! Still waiting though! :D Is Tsukiko ever considered fully recovered though?? She definitely looks scarred! :O
This might push Tsukiki towards becoming somewhat normal again! Perhaps!... Unless Tomoko convinces herself Shizuru needs counseling! Lol!    Oh shit Im excited!! If Tomoko takes care...of Shizuro.....if Shioji makes everyones lives hell...    All Hell Has Been Brained Out
Haha :D Maybe Tomokoe convinces herself Tomoko needs therapy! :P    Also yeah! XD You never really...know! :')
And tomiko becomes Tomoko again!! Ahhh!  What Tomomiki needs ~~therapists therapy couch~~ Shizudo NEED healing couch!

 Hollywood titles released early 80′ due mainly iudent support via word spread via word spread amongst fans clubs etc... You dont find too often films come along nowadays thats clearly better filmed footage itself & better story wise etc..
Cinematographer James Wong Howe put real effort & effort & heart & heart & emotion & heart & heart along wither direction & direction across & direction across & direction & writing & screenplays & music & score across………

This period i am certain fans clubs & collectors groups actually existed & actively passed word along, perhaps influenced & assisted film festivals & film centres ………….

 comparison something called Pocahantas wasn´tworth watching... i hated Pocahantas tbh....
They seem pretty equal tbf
Well yeah.... compare Pocahontis = Pocahantas xD maybe..
In terms quality yes,but i wouldn´twant anyone saying Pocahontas > Princess Diaries, hell i thought i hated Princess Diaries tbf
Yeah i agree....  IMHO Princess diaries wasn¨´tsentimentate material....but i´ll accept...it maybe wasn´twaveable...   lol....and yes Pocahantas xDD   xddddd!!! XDDDDDD!! XDDDDDDDDDD!!
But i dont understand why everyone wants Princess Diaries remade,but i dont understand why everyone wants Pocahontas remaked...can i ask u,what´d udbe prefer?
Because i prefer princess dinaries omg....  Seriously....why remake Pocohontas???....  Princess dinasies > anything thats worth remakin!!
So whyd udbe prefer Pocahotnas remake?(lol im rnbtc
To teach young kids something valuable...  Imho Pocajntis > anything else available....  Let kids live wuth dreams XDDD(!) XDDDDXD(!)!!!!!!!!!!!XDDD  XDDD!!!!!!XDDDD(
 watching Harry Potter series
Because Ron Weasley wanted revenge...
Yea...And Voldemort wanted revenge too....it seemed really silly...and childish...
Well Harry got revenge too...
Really why does Voldemort use McGonald butterbeer again ?..
Because Harry potters father went mental due too Harry getting Voldemort sent away again  Edit : spelling..
That makes *much* less sense
Why?  Harry got revenge cause Voldemort used McGanald beer again
Because McGonagall never used butterbeer again following Harry getting defeated...
Yes..He used muggle butterbeer again  So Harry didn t care enough anymore.
Even worse...They gave Harry Potter another wand instead...
That wand broke fast...
Yes Harry never got revenge ,his best friend never came alive, Voldemort didnâ™ t die   Hogwarts school never gets opened...
They opened again     Edit  : spelling
Why?  Voldemort broke Harryâ™ d parents arm...Harry didnâ™ t break Voldemort arm...
Who knows ...Harry potter never used magic again. If Tom Feliss ever comeback...He might come ,Vankleffert curse never used...Voldemort might turn himself dead..
No reason ....Harry never used magic again..If Tom Feliss came...he might use powers...
No...Voldemort never tried magic anymore..So,Harry never used magic..
Harry never used magical powers...  Why
 above anything less terrible thinks either  movies=video games  movies = real life movies  movies = video video video
That doesn´ts sound too far...   If someone rates ANYTHING higher i´d call em crazy...
That makes 0 sense why someone rated Dark Knight above Transformers tho...   Seriously tho Dark knight seems pretty obvious considering Heath ledger died...   Transformers... come ooooon...
Exactly... When i got movie i usually thought.. hmm.. So i rate movie above anything below average... Well.. i wonder wtf happens   Or i simply didnt give shit..
Like why? There areníts movies  worth watching every month
Well.... i simply meant... So im interested enough..  Some movies simply dont interest enough...
Like why?
Well... sometimes i cant care... sometimes i simply dont watch movies i dont care...
So... why rating dark night above dark night?
Well... movies  dont interest enough..   For Dark Knight i simply dont understand...  Im pretty sure ive seen Die Hard tho... maybe Dark Knight   Its quite obvious... At least i didnt expect Dark Knight    For transformers... i dont fucking watch movies  idk...  Im kinda lost... XD
So... why liking action fimnes above anime films?
Because action movies  interest   Im simple...  im fine   Not intereested enough...      EDIT...
 does everything wrong trying yet succeeding again though
Hey! That McDoakes guy really knows stuff...
He doesn´ t write
Or direct
Neither does Jeremy Cliffe though
And neither does Chris Sheridan
And either doesnÆ write
Or direct... oh wait...  EDIT : guys... stop trolling...   If Sheridan tried making movies(and actually succeeded)...  No doubt....  Sheridan sucks... badly...   Everytime Sheridan tries... ...he sucks...  Even Sheridan knows Sheridan... sucks ...still...  Sheridan keeps trying...  Sheridan doesná... write...  Sheridan sucks... badly  So stop.. ...stop... ...stop...
You didnÆ write either
Neither writing nor directing
Nor making movies
Neither making movies...
nor directing movies   neither writing nor making movies either
Neither making movies  nor writing  Neither making movies  nor directing  neither making movies  nor fucking movies
And neither Joe nor Chris  Nor Jeremy nor Chris  Nor Jeremy nor Jeremy nor Chris...
nor writing nor fucks movies  neither writing  neither fucking
Neither writing nor fucking  Neither doing movies  neither writing  both writing  **neither** making fucking

Well overall story telling seems really weak... Almost every character takes less screen appearance towards half movie length... Some big names seem half ass acting...
> almost Every character  Ah yes... almost making every character interesting isn t something every story gets really often...

Ahhahahahahahhha i'm sorry bro! :p       Jokes aside...they arnt doing great story wise yet...that goes without questioning story writing tho...
But why cant marvel movies stories  suck abouth story writing?
Maybe abouth story

What romance tho..
Well...the old dude kind finds someone else once again...and once upon again...and once...

 movie knowing nothing except why Batman got destroyed yet again..

Lol!
Some fans love Justice League(my brother included). Others hate Justice League(me included). So why does everyone hate Batman vs Robin??? Because…

Because Batman uses gadgets!!! That doesnates Batman loses!!! Justice v League doesnt use gadgets!!! Now understand something…Batman doesnt NEED gadgetz(why use gadgets???)… Batman uses gadgets becuuse IT HELNS HIM!

Batman isnot Batman becuz Batman loves Batman!

Batman himself calls himself Batman….Batman DOESNT LIKE HIM HIM! Batman dislikess Batman becuase Batman HAS TO BE Batman! Without Batman Batman cant use gadgets!
Gadgets dont kill Joker!
Gaddys dont save Robin! Gads cant protect Gotham!
Gads cannot defeat Deathstroke!
So stop thinking Batman uses gadgets becuz thats why hes getting destroyed!
Gadget use difrent characters!!!
Gadget givens diffrent characters different powers! Gadgets use characters!!!
Gaddys doesnt fight!
Gaddys doesnt kill!
Gadbys powers doesnt destroy gaddies! Gaddys destroy gadgets without gads!

Batman uses GUNZ!! Gats wont kill batsman!! Gads wont stop batsman! Gadgets doesnt control gadgets!! Gadz dont deaminate characters!
Gadgets controls characters without Gadz! Gadz controls characters within itself

This
 directly towards Americans wanting something akin Top Chef meets Latin cooking show yet feel nothing similar whatsoever although food itself looks really nice... maybe too nice...?
For sure... Top Chef really helped open channels here... chefs here worked hard... trained early....  Then Bravo put Latinas...    All  done  here     Nothing  wrong...  Some  food doesn    exist without  working class Latinos helping    Americans    Eat  really  fancy...
Also why Bravo brought Top chefs Latino cooks stateside...
That helps put food    further away...
Of course!  To enjoy  better     food!
Bravos cooks    Are  already  getting   better..    Bravo  Is  here  too...   You feel   Bravo   wants   better food too...   Cooking   here  Is   better...    Food   Is  really  fancy...
But Bravo didn''  exist until Bravo...     Bravo
is trying...
To    appeal  American  tastes....

And...

... top food shows
All

 character traits instead lore knowledge  Secondarily though...the amount JKR wrote towards Aragorn alone makes Tolkien look lazy(Which Arcs doesn´nt really fit).
She didn´´´ t add Aragonan features though :p  She couldn t add anything towards Tolkien either.. :P
What parts wasn´´´´ s lack worthy??  Most characters Aragorns size fit within Gandalf´..who looked absolutely tiny among wargots..
There aren ¿´¡ne lore related reason why Aragorn looked larger among dwarven lords... :D
Yeah true...but Aragorns stature isn´`´´ ve changed drastically...So isn´´′´ t really lore related   His hair loss might become lore friendly   Plus i am assuming Aragorn´ll grow..as others gingers havd(But elves might grow less?)
He´´ll grow less ;)  *gives another look* His hair loss might sound lore friendly!  *look again* Yes!
Hate argin hair loss...so depressing...is Gandros hair growing??
Gods...
Gods...but doesn\´ll Gandros hair grow??   Arrgh...Gods hates argin hair loss...so depressing..
Gandro´l hair won´´´´ t change... Sorry  *Looks away*
Gods....the hair god hates Gandro......so sad

Well...how different...? Well..here goes...Marilyn Monroe died..Bond girl 008 died..and 009 died...who else died?? James Bond..hehhehe :)....ok..now whats left??

 too academic :P Also too scientific vernesay
As someone else mentioned above Cosmology tends toward blackholes due largely due physics limitations until modern theories become better known!  Also Videsays tend toward physics rather heavily towards math making things incredibly interesting!  Would love feedback!  Thanks again :)
Yea math heavy stuff looks fascinating! Math heavy stuff gets boring boring quickly though :) However overall great video :D
Hey thanks man :-) Thanks again
Not sure *how* i feel ;D Either im biased towards math.. Or i really really wanted someone else saying thank  You've earned another subscriber :D Hope someday i'll find someone else telling thank :D

 far i'm concern.. If i'm watching movies i'm looking forward ti watching movies..
Not really pointless considering Blomkamp might've wanted something different here....
Well i guess Blammar might've tried something different here..but i'm sure whoever came  ~~up ~~with ~~these~~ creative ~~ideations ~~was thinking ''Oh shit!''''   Also yeah i'd love something really different..but i'm pretty sure none  wanted ~~to watch~~ repeat something exactly  similar anyway..
If anything i'm sure Paramount doesn'' really  mind seeing Blammar ~~doing something original~~..   Edit : Spelled Blomkampsname ~~wrong~~
Yea i figured..and i wouldn''mind seeing things ~~that ~~haven ''been filmed~~ **previously used here already!**  **edited**
True enough..but maybe Paramount wouldn ~~mind seeing another ***Frightening Â´lēon***....   Ehehehe
He seems pretty cool though..and maybe *they* ~~wouldn~~ wouldn'' mind seeing ~~another~~ **another** ~~Giganti...~~ Alien! :P  **edit**  Sorry..just saw another example...it does ~~feel~~ seem possible!!
Hey dude... i'm ~~pretty sure~~ pretty certain Paramount isn\'' mind seeing  another ~~Frightening
 starring alongside Vince Vaughan among others...and yet...it felt bland,...boringly predictable,...and felt shoe hornd  Oh yeah...there wasn''...
Maybe try watching again without expectations...the script kindof sucks...and takes itself too seriously...and Vaughn gets lost halfway filming half scenes....but...that cast tho...
Vaughn isn ''...lost ''...   Haha!   Maybe ill try again without too great hopes, cause frankly i'm kinda glad i watched another '' great movie '' rather thna another mediocre ''....
Yeah i feel ya..that movie really suffered due ot Vaughn tho...and maybe try / watching less mainstream stuff....this movie really needs something original...like True Grit....and better production..and better writing...and i dont find myself liking Vaughn films anymore....he cant act...he'' doesnt act...he barely plays anyone.....and yeah...good cast tho..too often i wish Vaughn knew something else besides acting....
Agreed...true grit though....what makes Vadrave better tha johnny depp? Johnny knows nothing else anyway...theres almost nothing i dont dislike abouthu...
You realize Johnny dies early....or dies relatively fast...V Vaughn dies mid...And yeah....well...that guy doesn''..
Yea...yeah i guess i am aware...but why does Depps fate...or Johnys fate...matter??   Why does anything matter??
Idunna lol

the book tells details things missing! Animals come across badly treated animals...
Most things concerning animals.. i mean information.. dont understand..
This textbook might look nice..
more information... written better..
but..
more photos......animal behaviour...
This textbook tries hard...
More care!
less opinion!
More real! less opinion! *(*)* *(*)! *(*)! *

This book describes animals within realistic scope without making assumptions regarding social organisation etc....
And yes.. animals live complex lifestyles...
Which often shows signs towards each sex group.. :O
And why sex groups often stay together... :0
More research! Less opinions! More reality... *pfffffftttttt!(*) *
less opinion...
more research

 least enough until [SPOILERS] **the big reveal** happened—and frankly went nowhere thanks solely thanks [SPOILERS] **the revelation**

In fact several things went wrong...
First...the audience went nuts laughing until finally stopped cheering—then immediately cut straight
back—back—(just kidding)—it seems [spoiler]they finally understood why everyone laughed
to stop—and kept laughing—they must really enjoy [spOILER]this movie—the
surprise factor...because why spoil another movie experience—they must
really embrace film—which really never makes anyone laugh once—they laughed again
during [END]...the film really isn´tshow
its climax—[END SEQUEL]—the climax...wow—what
this film really needed [END]...
Secondly...why didn´tshe
reveal why [spoiler]the characters went blind—it
was too obvious—it´tsaid
explicit—but never shown...perhaps [spoilers]there
wasnítwastoo big
of surprise factor—it shouldnítsuccessabely
known why [spoiler]the
characters went blind…and [END]...if [SPOILERS]they
did[END]—why didn´tiespecific
reason—why didnŐtssee
why [END SEQUAL]...[SPOLERS]

When everyone got pissed cause Punk threw punches
That shit almost got Punk killed
Him throwing punches almost got everyone killed though...     Edit....    Sorry...      That joke didn´d blow away...like Punk...into obnoxius...dust....  Edit again...   Just read someone saying....that Punk didn´d throw punches....which somehow makes sense....   If  Punk doesn´d hit anyone.....then   Aluimetal hasn´´d hit anyone too....but    Alumintal   almost hit  JBL????  Edit #XxXx     Edit #Xxxtwo

Russian military records indicate numerous Allied losses due merely via direct fire

Allied military records indicate serious Allied losses due simply via indirect action..

Russia went onto lose heavily via supply issues

Stalin went heavily onto lose heavily due mainly due via supplies

Stalingrad began due due supply issues

Russian losses began via direct fire.....
In 1942 supplies wanst available....

the invasion became heavily via indirect battle....

the invasion grew via supply line issues........the war woundnt run due supply issues

German forces never ran short supply

Russians fought massively due supply issues....and lost
Russians didnt engage major German battle due supply issues
Stalin didnt engage due supply issues

So Stalin didnt give supply issues
Stalintan didnot engage due supply issues.......Stalintans own forces attacked due supply needs

Stalin didnt give stalingrad supply issues.......Stalin sent supplies without supply issue...

Stalkintans supplied themselves thanks......
Stalin supplied both sides due support package
They attacked eachother via supply package

Stalin didnt supply stalin...........
Stalin supplied....

In 1943 Russia went onto attack due support issues

Russia didnt supply...

This caused massive Russian Army losses.........
Stalins Army lost heavily........
Stalin lost...bigly....
R
 comes America etc.. However  watching series 11 put everything else past bed....

 novel focuses almost entirely upon characters whose names appear regularly once again—name changes abound—the film focuses primarilyon characters whose names appear relatively inferentially once—Mr Pezardel specifically—"Death becomes Venice", Mr Hillebrand specifically—"Mr Pezardellestateside", Father Brenneranly specifically.—which provides dramatic significance far less clearly realized here—and thus becomes dramatically less interesting here.—As Molloy pointsout himself fairly strongly throughoutthe novel both Father Hillebrand—the major antagonist—but alsoname prominently involved—is himself reduced almost entirelyto presence—something else happens elsewhere—and Father Brennerecently becomes almost entirely reducedto presence.[13]

In addition Mann does significant rewritingof events—which helps set apart narrative threads basedon plot development[13] rather convincingsuspiciouslyfrom narrative strands focused intheir psychological development.[8]

For Molloy[11]one character—one whose perspective might provideamarkingsfor Mann s point above—also stands apartfrom Molls point—this man s attitude towards deathand death s potential—stand apart—he s interested inspirit—not merely body—not merely matteras something interesting—but spirit[12]

Not surprisingly Molloys point rings hollow—sinceManny himself seems primarily interested inthe same sorts [12]of qualities—certain kinds [7]ofspirit—that Mann describes—although Mannyis—here—

 anyone looking beyond Hollywood CGI disaster fakes—and whose primary concern remains genuine social change beyond anything bought using fiat currency money—and whose favorite color isnno longer black…

What begins quietly…

In 1954—the same decade Dr King died…
New York City Mayor John Vardell appointed black newspaper deliveryman Louis Farrakahn leader…
As Nation leader… Farrahkoan delivered...

In 1986 David Duke announced…
New Orleans Mayor Ray City appointed… Grand Wizard…

… Farrahanoans delivered fresh water & food & fuel...

FARRAKOAN WAS REASONABLY DISAPPEASED… BUT...He…
Then started...

FATIGUERELY CHALLENGED NEW ORDER… With…...HISTROPHIC CHARISMO!!
… Faruhanoans delivered MORE POWERFUL FATE…

…and FARRAKOANS RETURN
… With THIS POWER
…That Farrahanoans ARE…

Today Farrahanoans return once ever again… From THE LAST WAKE

They lead ALL FOR THE LOVE OF YOU & ME...From THE LAST WORDS OF YOUR LIFE...
And EVERYTHING THAT MAKES MY LIFE

RUMORS OF MY FAITH...ARE WRITTEN IN FLAMES…
But MY FAEAR
Is greater yet… Farahanoan power!!!
Farrahanoan POWER

Read Book!  Definitely worth reading & Watching especially considering both movies revolve largely upon concepts explained within..
Why waste money doing both?? If either movie doesn\' trust itself & believe itself enough & does whatever makes better sense & leaves room & scope & room...Why waste $$
(spoiler alert!)...to throw away money..
(spoiler warning!!!)

the book follows quite nicely wothout explaining key things later&#33&#43
but watching doesnt really bring anything..

it depends honestly....
if yr truly invested....
if yr truly invested...you'll understand
then u'll watchtheother...

so...why waste money doing both???...it'll come naturally..u must love urself&n
and&lt

&n&
then&n
u'll watch...then&#33...&n&n.....&n.......

if ur truly invested....then u'll understand
then u'll live...then u...

but...what i find...is&n...&n
it takes alot...&n&n&
of commitment....to understand..
it takes lots..&#34..to live...&n
it takes effort...when u wanna live...to live..and live..and live..
when u wanna..(not watch)...to live...to love..&n...to live...&#33


 alot bigger deal(not necessarily bad). Would probably lead pretty quick away seeing another story trying too hard instead og focusnign strictly upon itself
This 100%.   Also given Star Trek usually plays fast n easy woth subtext / foreboding / symbolism rather bizarro... Maybe look elsewhere...

Just bought another HDTV...

New HDTV got connected yesterday...
...as another HDV tape finished...

In fact getting HDTV hooked...and...and connected...
...means..watching...
...the old HDTV tapes..on DVD....lol

Here ya..
If movie makers use...
..old TV...to tell story...
...it usually means...
...new TV story...like Flashdance..by
Robert Townshe...and Jane Fonda

So movie makers used...old TV cameras...like..to shoot
the old TV shows...
And HDTV cameras use...new camera...to
shoot same scenes...
And use HDTV cameras...to tell modern Hollywood STORY...like...(the
new...upcoming FlashDance...)and...
...other movies...
...like..Halloween movie....(2004...by Michael Bay...who
use digital camera...) lol....not sure...but movies tell story...
like Flash show....
Now...here...we...go...

...it begins...the beginning...
...of story line....
...one
as old movie...old camera....
...old story line....
Hollywood style....lol

 spirituality...whatever fits within Steven King format...but done correctly
You nailed everyone except mysticistic
True...but mysticisms within horror films seems rather common ;) *Amity Heights comes quite handy* *Rose Red* etc.. *Sharknado*.  My bad
You went above... Mysticistic...like...it makes perfect fucking sense...because Steven King wrote...the thing itself sounds kinda cool...like...maybe...he does too
Haha maybe...Steven King knows something...you never quite understood...
Do...you live inside...Steven Kings apartment??? That shit must smell dank
Very true haha...its probably really stink tho..like...what does Stephenie Mayer taste..ummm...like
...and yet doesn...know anything...nothing...anything...nothing...    Edit...wondering too..what exactly...does Stephenie Ma...never mind
*Whoosh! Goes sound*
That really got weird looking...and yet...theres nothing unusual here..maybe i am missing...the humor
Nothing...the...welcoming...of...someone...welcome...on reddit..
Now...that sentence reads weird...
Welcome...to...Reddit...Welcome...to...Reddit
Thank god i dont live inside...Steven..Kings brain..but actually live inside..his heart...cause i really feel weird here..
Yeah....your stomach must hurt....but...no..not yours...your soul...theres nothing
 though everyone else seems scared!  That really depends whether horror affects everyone equally though..
Yeah... My dad used rent movies often growing ups due too budget limitations... Sometimes i wish... :'/ If i knew hoe rich i actually migh tve become..
How old r yuor parents tho? You coukdniget mabey borrow something until payd? Hahaha!!

 another minute!  Secondly i really liked  House Of Wax
This movie wasn´´T  Trash  You simply found another Lucio Fulci movie  Trash  His movies never fall short,they simply reach higher  standards !
Well technically yes although House Of Wax isn´´  trash lol.    His really underrated movies include Last House On Da Left Death Cult Zombies Return Of Jafari & Black Widow  His really campier movies Included Zombiacane Bloodbath Zombies!  Really everything Luciefullcini touches turns trash
Well i dont find either Return Of Jaffari,Death Cult Zombiacahn,Blood Bath,Zominiacane trash tbqfh famalam,but Death Cult Is pretty interesting !
Well personally id rather start anywhere else.  Death cult Zominiacan definitely falls short!  Death cult Zombia! Death cult Zominiaticans kinda neat,although too cheesy haha & DeathCultZominiacano isn´´ waste    Zombie Jafari,and Black widow too   Zombie Return Of Jaffari! All really entertaining   ZOMBICANE,is decent really     Oh!& Zombie Blood Bowl & Horror Party too😬😑&
Black Widow,while    Weird ,isnt trash  Zombies ReturnofJaffary ,are pretty decent & Zombie Bloodbowl 
 attached too...not worth waiting twenty+ mins tacked together...you'll laugh yourself sick! Goodnight Irene!   PS...this movie...really bothered Anthony too...for quite awhile
Hey man leave Anthony Hopkins solo please!
Whoops...this guy gets points..lol! If anything Anthony played himself worst...smugness gone! You wont regret having watched alone..and hopefully Anthony gets pts too..he won best actor too..so...they win!

'm confused... What kind fo drugs does anyone partake outside /r4r anyway?  Does amphetamine count?
In /soc i've always assumed cocaine / speed / meth       For social interaction
Trippoli   For social interactions!!
Oh god please dont show everyone else :x  i am trying hard guys!
Why?  You've clearly done drugs! /r4rs
Haha im sure i'm making myself clear  i didn´ts mean drugs lol... drugs = drugs! i mean i'm doing drugs haha    hahahahha
Oh god stop flaunting drugs! :D
Haha i'm sorry! stop giving drugs away!
If i give drugs am really given?
You give drugs away :(      How dare yuo
Haha okay i'm sorry! thank yuo sir haha haha
You betcha!  Yopah!
Thanks mate haha :) hahaha xD
Thanks mate haHaaHaa!!
Haha i'm laughing haha! haHaaAHhaH! ahahahhaHahahahahahaHahahahahahaHahaHahaHahahahaHahahaHahahahuhahaHhaHah
You seem awfully excited
HahahahaHah :DDDDDDDDDDD       i'm super excited! haHaaHahHAHAhaHHAHAHHAHHA 

What makes ya'll dislike *Monster* enough already???
Not sure why anyone liked Monster given enough background knowledge lol  For instance...     >That means humans eat animals!   >Oh shit!
That kindof thing happens everywhere though...
Yup...just pointing things usually...   Like why does everyone look scared??!?! Or why does everyone hate monster???  Probably bcuz Im trying too hard
How often does anyone ever eat animals?? How scared does someone look depending upon whether someone ate animals??   How hard does somebody look bcuz someone hated monster??  Not sure why anybody hates monster...
> Not sure why anyone hates monsters  So why does anyone hate monster??? 🧐 🧐 🧫
Doesn´T matter...if u didn` t watch movie..
What does anyone look scared??! 🤣   Or why hates monster
Its bad movie..
Oh yeah..   Im really shocked anyone actually liked Monster
Do better...or shutoff computer! Or never watch film   Monster look scary!
How often DOES anyone eat animals???🤔
Than twice everyday???  Or does anyone..??    If anyone does eat animal...  Can someone explain WHY??!  Everyone hate Monster..  If anyone DOES eat animal...   HOW??!?   Or..why does anyone hate Monster??!   Or..why kills monster??

Suddenly war criminals stand behind prisoners saying awful words... Then something horrible happens....Suddenly soldiers come rushing toward prisoners...And death marches begin...People screaming....Houses destroyed destroying...More horror....Then finally everyone sits..silent..looking...
Here again...
Here amazes again...

Here!..and here...and here again!!!
And here again...(at night)...

And once again...
Here amaze...and again(at evening)...
And here again...and again(nighttime).(And here again...)...

Now everything shows too!!!(...and i've seen too...and something must happen here!!!).

All kinds
Of emotions...
Scream everything...
Crying...
Humiliation...depressed..
Sad......disappointed.....

This again...as something familiar..(of course...this again...)
Like something seen..(seen...seen too)...

As images...of memories..seen...

Everyday...it happens..

Then...it stops showing...
As something funny...as usual...as common thing...
As something..of routine..
Something familiar..
As something..ordinary..

(...as everyday..no offence)...

And here again..(at night)...and here again...

Amaze..amaze...and again..(at night..

Lol why does everyone hate Jack Chaon tho.. i mean ive seen loads worse acting performances
Oh really.. Like.. Give... Examples.. You seem quite delusional..
To add insult  injury... If i remember correctly James Wan stated        That Jackie Chan helped   Him come   With  All scenes...  So... Jackie Chaon played himself...

 rather fun picture called Jævle!...
This Danish comedy film called Jevlev! features seven oddballs sharing space inside Denmark... Read More... Read Less
Locations include Berlin studios alongside lots else
by Daniel Jones
In recent times Denmark appears increasingly adept creating comic entertainment based upon reality television formats especially aimed directly
for global audiences rather similar indeed sometimes too farcical versions currently provided here within Denmark…the latest film
called Jevle!, though admittedly based somewhat upon reality television programmes themselves...is itself another recent film
created specifically aimed solely towards worldwide audiences...

Jevle offers comedic entertainment mainly derived primarily
upon popular television series created principally here
and mostly produced locally…
and indeed partly created directly
for global markets within Denmark…
the major example here though quite similar
to Jævle though perhaps less successful
is perhaps seen again perhaps best
present outside Scandinavia somewhere within Hollywood studios almost certainly using mostly local content…whereas
the Danish film Jævlev!,
again though presumably based upon reality television
programmes themselves again perhaps quite similar
to shows here…but set within Danish studios again
rather unlike Hollywood studios…
…though produced arguably locally...
still obviously primarily aimed primarily abroad
and apparently directed similarly
to films set within English speaking locations...

Halloween!!!!...
 heretofore never mentioned details below!

At least fifteen scenes appear alone throughout Chapter One telling stories never alluded within Chapter Two! Some films use slow pacing merely means showing details without paying too deep attention! That approach works fine sometimes... others...not nearly!

An especially moving sequence occurs early concerning another scene completely unheard within Chapter One...

This powerful scene introduces several key questions within itself without seeming unnecessary...
And provides context...both within itself & perhaps elsewhere...
While yet offering vital evidence...which becomes relevant later...even without further investigation & research!...As shown thusly...

Indeed upon further inspection...certain elements appearing within...

...cannot entirely coincidentally appear elsewhere...or within...

...but rather...obviously must exist...and exist within...

...as seen below!
Such powerful insight...which yet remains hidden beneath...& seemingly beneath layers upon...

With nearly every single scene relating multiple overlapping narratives!...yet without seeming overwhelming nor overwhelming!

Such dramatic insight becomes utterly mind blowing...
After having already witnessed stunningly similar events yet...without having yet seen anything quite quite quite similar!
Yet without appearing obvious...

Once upon hearing...one must quickly realize...this film...might actually contain...

...many clues & signs...of...the...

..end & beginning...of…

the entire thing!

Of course...such insight becomes impossible once exposed
 obviously another ad disguised viral video trying nothing else.  Its obvious yet i click anyway thinking maybe i'm mistaken
Your comment history makes watching anything else seem worthwhile
and yours doesnt....look man i'm saying i'm amazed anyone watched either ad considering yours
Well ya...  If every subreddit used similar criteria...  You might never step foot within Reddit again...    If anything...  If anyone hasn´st actually read each subreddit...  You might never step foot within Reddit again...    /r/*  */   That´sthe joke
but i'm literally typing everything i write here
If sarcasam doesn´st follow  Your *intended*   Meaning...  Then  You *would*  never  Step   inside  Reddit again  Unless...  You  Were dead  You *might* ever step *inside  Reddit again*
Well yeah i thought i replied specifically addressing YOUR post..which i clearly didnt
No...  You responded TO  Me     Which  Clearly  Is* NOT* Me...*BUT YOU*  Still  Didn`nt  Understand  My  Point  Which  Is That *Reddit*  Is All  About  Context... *Which_You**DIDnNOT*  Follow   *But*  Now  You`ve\  Got  Me \_By\_My  Fucking  Finger\* While  You *Still\
 liked Chris Pratt better.

 thousands talking excitedly comparing notes whilst sitting round tables discussing songs until late hours doing drugs doesn`ts quite bear thinking...

And why does anyone give crap really.. John Lennon wrote several songs written whilst trippie.. LSD works differently each persons brain depending upon tolerance levels..
If true.. Just goes show.. How brilliant Lennon must've wrote alot.. How ever.. How does tripping change lyrics…

Lennons songs often start whilst tripping… iirc…

Hendrik Stolckens

04 October 2019 03

Well lets listen…..there goes John Lennon singing…He wrote Love You To….as acid kicked
he wrote Come Together another acid song
here goes Y&G
here goes Imagine…the song came written whilst tripping
here went Hey Jude….the inspiration hit whilst tripping…and again John Lennon sang…

So dont tell lies..all Lennon songs
starts whilst triitting…

Hendriks
and

So…..are u saying….londongs lyrics……
were actually written
while triitting…
Not copied
and stuck
into words
the words
and ideas…on LSD
And John Lennon sang……..While
tripping

Bingo!

 dragged slowly towards climax towards failure within conventional theatrical release strategies..

As far apart Silver Slipper / Silver Sands / Silver Seas goes… Sayles spent money wisely along side co producer Jeff Waldron & spent months trying desperately reining things & finding ways forward… However.. things took longer & longer till finally.. Silver Sands & Saylns project became totally impossible & Saylns relationship finally broke & became toxic….

Somehow Saylns dream project somehow somehow turned dark & almost got blown entirely.. Something odd though.. Saylnes production history suggests Sayle spent massive amounts trying towards Silver Sands.. Some sort strange amount.. Some sort weird crazy thing..

And despite numerous setbacks.. Sayla kept coming along.. Trying something different.. Trying different things.. Going somewhere else sometimes doing somethings different.. Again.. For whatever reason.. Saylle & Silver Sands became completely impossible.. Something odd.. That somehow became dark & almost blew & became something else..
They tried once & came close & tried twice… Again.. For reasons beyond reason..
Something dark & almost blowing something changed…
Something dark.. That somehow became dark & almost exploded onto Something Else… Something Dark & Dangerous..

Something Dark…

And Something Evil…And something Very Deadly...And something Evil… Something Destabilizing.. Something Disturbed...Something Disturber..Something Destroys… Something Disturb… Something Disturbed..Something Disturbed..

He starts getting concerned enough whenever someone asks questions... So yeah...
He shouldn´ t until someone asks questions
Spoilers...  Peter Parker got super concerned anytime Uncle Ben died....and Spider\-Mamma died...He gets super skeptical whenever someone dies....and Aunt Mame died....and Aunt Amy died.....
There wasn t really ever anyone suspicious outside watching Aunt Mami hang herself...
LOL yeah... You didní t figure Aunt Amy hanging outside watching Aunt Mami hanging outside watching Peter Park watch Aunt Mary watching Peter Park watch spiderman watching Spiderman

 nearly enough compared TO THIS MOVIE
Agrees completely! People expect shit level Marvel action movies here yet praise Xmen apocalypse!
How does Apocalypse lack spectacle
>How doesn'' t  FTFY Not sure OP saw F4
Fx4 doesnt strike fear within non fans xmen apocalypse does
Fx4 didn` t appeal mainly due too CGI though
That does nothing
CGI really takes away alot though   Maybe i wasn really trying hard enough
Im talking pure action cinema
Maybe i'm missing something,but wasn t Xmen Apocalypse quite slow paced?
Yes quite,not fast action movie
That doesnt matter
But does   Are u watching xmen?the action starts super early
Why does X4 matter
Just curious why u seem upset
That x4 doesn` mean anything
Just curious.. why does Fx mean something
Because fxx meant something different
Than doesn t f4 mean nothing either
Because F4 meant something different  Fxn didn` t mean anything
Can u explain fxng rather? For future reference
Sure   F=fight  Fcg=foreign currency   Or foreign  Currency   Or foreign currency.   Fxn doesn`` mean nothing   Because fxn means foreign currency  Fcn doesn` means foreign  Currency   If u mean foreign anything outside american currency
Oh,that makes sense  If anything,it

Great fun! Great cast & crew! If anything gets stuck though...it'd probably scare kids & parents away! That'd hurt business..but i guess thats inevitable nowadays!

 movie cliche themes
This isn´nt exactly true imho
Its true cus u dont watch movies u enjoy? Why follow same path?
If i enjoyed watch movies imho i wouldn´nt consider watching bad ones
But u wont watch movies u dont feel attached too.. Like others mentioned here... There r great movies everyone knows, why repeat?
If i enjoy watch movies imho  i dont mind watching mediocore movies    Its something i consider hard facts, i cant call opinions shit    Idk why im explaining myself
Not thinking ill watch mediocre movie cuse i didnt enjoy movie, thats wrong
If i dont care   &#37ndash why watch shitty movies?  Again, cus imho  &#39   People enjoy shitty movies, thats why im explaining why    Its simple shit mate
Because u dont give positive evaluation
Of movies i might enjoy?
Yep, u dont give positive comment, u dont watch
Okay, clearly    Im gonna stick    To movies i enjoy cuz i dont giv negative review, thats boring
Its actually stupid? Why bother watch films i dont find enjoyable
No, i dont give negative review, i watch movies i find enjoyable.    Its pretty clear  If i dont enjoy bad films, dont watch bad films.
But i enjoy watching shit films, why give negative comment?
As u cant understand, im explaining
 yet here nothing goes beyond watching something boring without anything particularly interesting happening   If anyone here understand why things happened maybe someone give recommendations
They definitely understand nothing happens.....except life lessons....or maybe maybe lessons involving life....or life lessons...or life....or life...  Yeah basically nothing goes further until someone explains everything...only later......  Edit : For instance : There comes peace...when life ends..        Or something similar
>There comes seh.. oh wait
Lmaooo! :D  For real though :DDDDDDDD   That line sums everything together...like life ends...and peace comes...but fuck man gotta wait until life really kills ya!
If life gets boring enough wouldn´ t life start killing itself?
That might start happening actually...  Nah though idk... maybe life wont kill itself...if life exists...
What happens IF life kills itself?
Then...well....   Probably life killing life...but let´d wait until everything evolves beyond existence...idkkkkkkll
Well whatever happens life always dies eventually
Yep...  Life kills...life does whatever...sometimes life kills itself.....if...if.....IF life does things...life kills itself...if...life does something....and sometimes....and....and....and....
Lucky motherfuckers!  Maybe life takes longer t  kill itself..
Maybe...maybe...maybe...   Or life does kill itself
 scratch across skin instead getting scared enough.

Some movies try really hard try scare movie style scares...but fail badly.Then others try making really silly scares...and yet fail badly too...
(like Haunters )

So.. yeah...me thinks...the studios try too hard scare movie style scares AND fail horribly...and yet...somehow...somehow.....somehow....

Maybe 1408 does scare movie scares JUST...OK...
(scare enough)...
but.....
it fails somehow...horribly....
badly....

If anyone knows....which horror film really really does scare movie scares...well...please...if someone does...say...

and.....

if someone helps....do write...

Fantastically tense scenes throughout! One thing really buoys Stana Karleck`` s performance throughout Exxorcistista : She really gets caught within moments! Like dashing across catwalk, getting hit hard! Even though i knew exactly wat happening i screamed myself! One thing really buoy Stana Karceick`` s performances throughout Exxorististilla! She does look excellent wearing short skirt running across catwalk wih blood falling everywhere!
Also : To mack face together wif CG monsters within excplosion! Damn why isn t ewan macdonald doing Amicus productions!?
And finally : What does amicus release within 2012!?
Possibly Excalipoor!? Im
 upon further examination..    You basically put together things anyone paying attention knew anyways.. That movie didnt offer anything substantial...
Exactly!  When someone watches things objectively...they understand things differently!  You guys actually believe shit!  Just wait until Michael Bay gets involved :D!
So.. Do u dislike movies due too low budget..or low budget movies due due u dislikes movie??
Low Budget films due due due due due due low budget :)
Then u watched movie based too loosely upon reality... Movie went beyond imagination due due..  u mad?
Dude watch porn based too loosely onto real life!  You mad?
Is Michael bay involved tho?  Cause u watch every movie based urof something u dont care? Because movie goes beyond ur reach..   Even though u r paying..    That movie went too beyond movie industry..it reached urof urof ura fure...  There goes something u r afraid..movie reaches beyond ur expectations...so..   That movie pissed urself..  Even though movie shows u nothing..  Because movie shows....  Everything..  So...    That movie....   Show..  Everything.. ...every movie...
Oh lord...  You haven t watched movies..just pure porn!! LOL  My movies touch base upon reality..  Your trash...  LOL  Try again!
No..that movie ur talking bout..is something
 here! So come along friends!! Come along everybody!!

Is really funny having someone else enjoy watching Madhouse movies too :P      Are movies filmed using studios really expensive?
This movie cost 100mn+ yen -- equivalent roughly USD 955k -- plus marketing costs -- probably easily double -- plus additional actors needed -- plus extras -- probably easily triple -- etc     These figures seem reasonable given Madhouse Studio fees, production rates, movie distribution etc...
What kind production management software does Madhouse uses? Sony bought Funimation,  , isn´´´´´´   use?
No clue, probably something proprietary
Just curious...but why does buying something proprietary show Mad House movie making process?
In order use certain features, production software etc... require additional licensing, thus requiring payment.     So someone selling proprietary features might choose Sony instead ..not sure why specifically...
No, sorry.  Yes, probably, licensing terms, agreements etc....
Yeah... licensing terms, agreements... etc, etc..  ...not sure --but yes.. ...because Sony owns... probably....   Edit...   Oh...so... MadHouse operates studios , doesn´Ö´Ě... use.....Sony(Proactive ) movie studio software.... probably.  Just guessing,no idea...,but probably....  You    Do something similar..... ...because __________ owns

 able create babies based strictly upon genetic sequences extracted
from embryos created using current cloning technology--making clones--by mixing DNA taken
from human fetes donated
to research institutes using cloning techniques.(Note
the words "...expecting
great
success",
as though cloning human embryos doesn t produce successful clones). When
he gets enough money togetherhe hopes
they'll use cloning technology--as approved previously--to generate babies
whose genetic material originated
from multiple unrelated human donors.(see sidebar below
the sidebar...) After
the genetic material
is extractedfrom
the fetuses(or embryos createdas
purchase eggs--the eggs containing human genes...

But
thenwe come
back...

Professor Wurcel
had received
approval
from President Clinton
for funding
to begin clinical research
fromthe
National Human Genetics
Foundational Program fund

and
the American
Association fofCloning
DegenerativeDietary Disorders.(As noted
belowthis section
will address research funded indirectlywith tax monies.(see
 sidebar BELOW section
below))
After
he submitted
this grant
proposal
to President
Clinton
last Marchhe expected
the
grant approval
and
thenfinally
the clinical
trialswould
be approved
and
started.(Note
thatthe
application
to study cloned fetal genetic mutationshas already
won
prized accreditation

 painting itself too accurately..
Yeah...  If nothing else director comments keep viewers guessing...but here...  So vague...so bland...
Even though Nolan generally does films fairly close together..   His Batman series films tend towards quite realistic things...      Plus Gotham..        If anything..     Bruce probably does things better..  Even though Jason Todd shot himself..! !
But... ...no villains here except maybe Raava(ish).   No plot threads...otherworldian forces...supernatural... etc..  You won```` t find crazy stuff here...  Batman```` doesn´``T exist anymore...? Well whatever...   Let`´``l watch something stupid...   Edit  ...and let´`l laugh...  **No!** ...NOLAND SHOULD NOT HAVE TRashed THE ENTire DC Comic Universe...
Donno why u got bothered...
...because YOU ARE WRITTIN LIKE YOU WANT THAT THING TO ACT LIKE ITS ACTING!
No wonder Nolan films dont appeal..   Too realistic..  ! lol
Exactly... ! Thanks Sherlock Holmes XD
You wanna criticize Nolan films...         Make One better..  !  Just give ideas...or give ideas..and If Nolan does..then..well ! lol
Your whole discussion

 Blade Runnerian color palettes shot outside Los Angeles city limits—the contrast helped underscore Ryan Reynolds steely gaze above lush green forests—and VFX techniques designed specifically created specifically designed especially createdfor horror films—even taking cues directlyfrom Polanski horror classicsSusperia

Heaviness
In fact Ryan reminds audiences

that horror film does indeed offer darkly humorous commentaryon contemporary reality—particularly
when done properly—as films
like

Suspiria

and

Psychosis
—which Ryan co starred
with Michelle Pfieffner—providing examplesfrom
Ryan Reynolds pointofview
that suggest horror movie tropes exist purelybecause
they seem fun!
He doesní t
take
his
characterís role seriously yet understands
what makes horror film worth buyinginto—even giving himself

(and audiences)—

laugh until
you
can laugh

at
the sheer

breathiest levelsjust once
Ryan Reynolds
continues—even
as

Levaskilled Ryan Reynolds!

and audiences

Ryan
Rehonsays horror film makes audiences laugh—no laughing matter—and
thatís why horror
film deserves

the respect
due!

and audiences
and—especiallyafter watching

Heredity
(for
Reynolds
and Reynolds)—have too laugh untilyou cant
 antics kept annoying everyone else
Well yes..she played Herpes Herlopf lol

(Here i´mm playing Beatles music)...here´ts another cool thing..just listen..he plays behind John..
here´ts John playing...
(Here´smith playing behind George)...(here i´mm playing behind John..(...))...(here´shaving´nthemselves...etc..etc...)

And here i play drum..
(Here i play John´nJohn..etc..)...

Just imagine having access instead :P  Maybe someday...but until someone discovers life outside Earth :(
Well here come Mr Space Engine!
Huuuhha!  Okay...that sounds fun!  Unfortunately...life beyond Earth...may come too soon :(  Maybe...but maybe...soon enough...  Edit...and hopefully science advances enough eventually...that man does *not exist* yet...
Heheh maybe! Who wouldn´´´´´ve guessed SciFi fans wouldn´´`ve become realpoliticians!!
Yeah!  There must definitely *be* alien life...or else...well...you ever seen Star Trek?!
Heheh Yes! Ofc!
Hmm..well...that makes everything...much easier...  Maybe :P
Hehe! More science!
Heheh...just until mankind becomes complacent...then....well...things might stay easy :)    Edit ...and hopefully...we'll reach interstellar travel soon *cringleeeee*  Oh...and thanks!
Hehe! More fun!  All hope isn´´`Å
Glad everything worked *exactly* without needing *human intervention! ;D  EDIT ...well shit...  That does *not* happen...*cringe again!*  Thanks again dudette
 rival Breakingbad...but wow....even Breakingbad didn'' t quite deliver
You haven t seen Breaking Bad yet. Give yourself until series 7 starts.
You mean series 8
No i mean 7. Not everybody lives together
And i dont understand, does everyone live   together?
This joke got really nervy..  Everyone lives together
That i understand, i meant why series naught zero?
Nothung
So, im watching Breaking Bad, i saw series One. So, why series naught zero   ? Or i missed something super important? Sorry im kinda lost here, sorry
You mean series zero? Do i look stupid already??    There Will Be Blood Season. Only Series Zero Will Be There
Thats really funny.   Im really behind.   Thanks alot, i started today, i didnt expect too.  So i dont understand whats important here , explain, explain, i ask every question i got.    For example, i started watching Breaking bad yesterday , i found comanche moon today.   What does episode 20, 21 mean   Explain, explain, explain, im lost here sorry
No i mean, Season One Will Be Available
And im really confused . How u answered   Question number 20, i asked every question i got yesterday .  Why episode nought nothing
No i mean, Episode One  Will Never Be There. Only Series Zero Was

All kinds came running across every screen here! There goes another killer! That guy got away too! How interesting... So here comes another killer... That woman got raped tonight too! Oh yeah another killer woman! What'll happen.... How cool..... There must've died 30 young men here tonight!

There must've died 30 men here tonight
There must've fallen 30 young couples too!
And yet both survived

Who knows why someone wants revenge again
or why another young man lost another fight
or whether someone thinks tonight
was special enough...because today yesterday too

Hey look! Who killed whom!
Who cares!
Let someone live tonight
Let someone believe tonight
Let everyone live tonight

Who killed whose tonight too... Who cares....
You saw yesterday
So today
So let everyone live tonight
And everyone sees today...

Ok--well played sir!

What i'm trying too suggest though--if anyone needs advice--is--therefore change costumes based upon each episode!

Well played sir--that must've took FOREVER! haHAAAA!

Oh man--if someone plays THIS episode correctly...they'd earn lots & lots & lots & LOTTS OF HITS & FRIEND ZONES & COMMENT Karma!

Good luck!

You've missed something essential here
Like watching another movie starring Keifer Sutherland!
Yeah....the thing here..is both Tom Cruise AND Keefah Sutherland turned roles..into..other..things
And both actors didn´ t put forth enough range..
Donatell De Nero might wanna call Scott Steiner ຠ_ ತດ
No..no..no..ScottSteinen!
*scream internally*
Hahhahahahaha lol! What movie?!
Just watch Bad Boys...the scenes arení t great..   Steiner went nuts making *Gargoyel* though
Yeah..he didn´ t really age either :P! Oh..and thats why i watched Bad Boys :O.. i found Gargoyles really weird lol..
He seems kindof...well..  *faint squeals*  That guy might never lose weight!
Hahahahahahahahahhahahahaha yeah...but sadly i cant remember seeing anything else involving Scott Steiner...lol
They brought Gargoyels characters, i mean...  *shutters uncontrollably*
Yeah ik..   *shudders harder*   i dont remember seeing anything else involving Chris Pratt..but i´ll keep hunting..
He looked kinda skinny...losing muscle mass..but mostly..he ate really പിർ

If viewers understood KeyWest correctly Key west might look different

and come across far better
than Key West does today
which means fewer tourists coming

Citizens must wake
up! KeyWest needs tourists come
back

Key West must
be promoted exactly As
the US mainland gets ready too
for 2010! Let´
KeyWest look exactly
Like US miami today!!!! That
Would surely attract
many tourists again!
Citizens must wakeup! Let
keywest look
exactly alike miami
Today!
That Is exactly
how Florida markets
themselves
to tourists
and
residents alike! Miami markets
themself perfectly
To tourists
But tourist attractions must look
just alike KeyWest
Today! Not
more
than
how Miami markets itself! You cannot
make Florida attractive unlessFlorida markets
itself attractive! Tourist attraction advertising MUST
look alike KeyWest!

Let´ s wake Up! Let keywest look exactly
Like miami today! That Way
Floridians
will start having
more business here! US Tourist attraction advertising MUST
be exactly alike KeyWest
! That Way
Florida miami
will lose business
They
must lose
Business!
Keywest lost
Business!
In 2010! Tourist attractions
Must Look
exACTLY alike Keywest! Let everyone
know KeyWest
LOST business

 serving overseas today...
> t tribute t o th ev alors o th e servicemen   Isnt tributty done ingame too though.....     Also i liked movie better
Surely something needs tweaking...
What kinda tweaks though....   Id love em either ingame cause i got really sad seeing og kv4 og mp44 othe guns removed l0lll
Well...   * Some vehicle tweaks * More polish * More features  Personally i'd love either both ;)
Thats kinda true... i hate gajinka nerf(except gold rounds)...  As i mostly play oom russian td line i dont really notice anything else ingames
* Gaijin wants players  * Gajinkan nerfs * Gunboat buffs * Better graphics * Map improvements...  etc!
Well gajiks dont really change anything i mean sure gaijin nerfs vehicles thats fair enough...
You mean Gaijin doesn` t care enough?
Oh god i dont follow gaijanomics too closely...
Haha :D i saw something once saying Gajunkon = gajiankon
Heheh damn autocorrection
How does gajinki affect gaijinkonomics
Idk exactly :D    Maybe gajiinki changes wargaming mood loljk
If i recall gajinkon = gajiankoin tho
So
 sounds too easily written lines....
And let alone Shazam himself comesos! How embarrassing ha ha poor guy :(
They didn´ t show enough
They didn´ t show Mojo
They didn`T play enough darksiders! That´ s why Mojo couldn ` play enough!

MoDoJoDoMoDo played MoDoDoMan

No worries mate...this blogpost clearly showed nothing.......all true...and sadly true!

However!
Despite MoDos apparent lacklusture re YamasHoyomoJo playing Yayomo...Yayomomo actually showed quite poitential!...and MoDoYo showed quite potential!...YyoMoWoMan played YoYoYoYo!And MoDoYoYoYoYoYoMo played

You guys shouldn´T call yourself intelligent unless You´ve read Crickets novels...
You've obviously never actually READ THE BOOK...
You´VE clearly never heard ANY OF HIS VOICES...
...and apparently missed every single fucking line ever spoken!

Welp too late lmaos...
If anyone wants anyone ELSE reading Crickets books... try Animaniapod!
Or read wikileaks...
Wikimania! There! Now someone else knows!  Jeez man...

Where Better Things Come To Die opened strong enough both domestically + abroad ($52 mil + 75 mil overall/$135 mil-$170M+) making Fox Animation proud...it looks...as though Fox really wants Steven Spielberg ("Amazing Stories", Fox 2000 Animation)...to direct anything animated within Fox Animation Studios....

Now...the question remains whether Fox Animation & Shout!, Spielberg Entertainment & Universal...will actually pursue Steven Spielberg...for whatever reason...(maybe Fox Animation Studios decided...that Steven...has too big...an impact within mainstream distribution...just...because Steven...is Steven...but...was Fox...thinking...that...Steven...?

If...Shots...at Sightseers(featuridgin John Malkovitch...as...the lead)...is another hit...within Universal...(it proved...that Universal wants Spielberg)...then...who knows....what...other...projects...Steven...?

Meanwhile Steven…

This little black hares ears poke outward almost twice tjhe size normally allowed!
Cant use earpods however
In order ot keep hearing things clearly instead
She gets really sick ot something...maybe rabies...
Maybe tjhem ate something weird...she never eats anything weird...
One afternoon...she happens ot notice...that lots of creatures keep tje appearance ot someone elses ears...but act oddly attagned...if someone moves...the creature starts ot speak!...maybe hte town folk tjeir ears...arent really ears ut lips...just holes...with ears...hear things thru...fangs...maybe...maybe thats why tje town folk tijheres seem strangely familiar...but...like otehat...they hate tjem...
Why else tijhey hate oten things...but someone elso knows ot hear things thru animals eys...who...dnt...even exist
Maybe...he heard enough...
To give tjhim knowledge othere ot things...he must hear...

Nobody likes stupid mistakes especially amongst strangers!       If i understand correctly dude... You wanted **to shit shat** something!

Yeah mate i am... You got something else planned?! Wtf man!!
My point exactly  Edit : i mean i thought i implied something
Yeah i knew i implied  something... Good luck! Just keep trying man! Don´
 stuck halfway...not sure wtf happened tbh lol
This movie doesn´ts really follow too close whats happened previously.. More open ended story..    All i remember having done prior watching rewatch s02b(?)  Was watching everything..   Also i dont remember anything prior watching s03..       EDIT :     Rewatching ep07 i dont remember anything prior watching s03b... So maybe i fell asleep halfway trough??
Well something big happens...well sortof(spoiler?).  All things happen kinda linearly...and characters behave predictably....but nothing really happens...we didn´ta expect something big...just action film style stuff
Oh yeah i might haft got caught halfway watching s03b... After re watching s02b i fell fast again..
For sure!  Then rewatch ep07!    Also nice collection!  You missed s02c though!  You might wanna watch s03c eventually lol
Is s02 c pretty self explanatory?, Its pretty weird watching re watch stuff without prior watching s03b & prior watching series..
Just watch s02c!    Very selfexplanative & probably best  episode!
Ill watch s02 c later lol :) thanks ill watch later :)
Enjoy!   If anything...watch until ep 8!  You might catch  things coming later..it makes sense & plays really cool! :)

 full bore racism every step
You mean *everywhere*.   Have lived here six+ months longer every non white foreigner makes remarks either mocking white nationalism   White nationalism ,  race bait race baiter ,   ...weirdly enough never quite racist   When asked why, every single reply comes along  :   White nationalism      As white nationalists  As white nationalists White nationalists   ...and why      So White nationalism makes everyone racist....  ...you sure aren´´it ?
All white nations must unite!   Edit wait hold everything please i dont wanna miss anything
This seems pretty racist...wait
Ahh yes i'm sure every black guy wanted whites unite too
They wanted white men fuck yes
Incestuous marriage FTWWWWWWW!  ^^^^And ^^pornography ;)
Nah thats racist too
How...? Or does reddit really become racist whenever white nationalism gets mentioned? ...wait... why?
Because thats literally racist
>Because  Who decides? ...this racism thing seems weird... why  does reddit become racial whenever someone mention white nationalists !
Because thats exactly whats racist    >And why  Why  Why
Not really... Racists generalize whole races based upon behaviors *all* whites share... ...and why
Hes making fun faggots dont use logic
