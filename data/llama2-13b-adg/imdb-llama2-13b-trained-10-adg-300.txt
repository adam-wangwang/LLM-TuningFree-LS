. Sound strange? I'm not surprised. Standing alongside the grimy hard-working thriller Stoned (which also came out recently) in the same cinema, Evening was like a tulip in a trunk of beef jerky. I dislike the term chick flick, because it implies that women are stupid, but there is no denying the demographic it attracts: middle-aged women. They are the herd that walks out of the screening room near me clutching a box of Kleenex or a bottle of water. These women could stop me if they wanted. They could cure anything from broken bones to cancer, but they do nothing. They choose to live a hypochondriacal, second-hand existence. They want to weep without trying. They want to bleed without being pierced. These women want to pretend they are being raped and they assault you with excited gasps escaping at the moment when real characters enable their fictional deep-felt anguish. It's their way of affecting honesty through the medium of entertainment. The emotions that are "stirred up" are there for the all-too-easily provided automatic reaction. I would blame this kind of movie-going experience on those fewconfused women who are never able to see through the image to the real women below.
a 35mm Eastman C5414 film stock makes that all the more impressive, as there are excellent shots on city streets, through alleys, over long distances and high above the traffic. There are some stunning visuals in this film. Cities in the evening glowing with human energy - the dizzying view of traffic from a video surveillance camera - beacons of light in glass and steel office buildings. It is all beautiful fun to watch, at least up to a point. After that it reveals its true nature: a smug exploitation film. Almost as bad as the TV show “The Storm Chasers”. To be fair, it does have weather footage the likes of which has not been seen since 900mb clouds smashed skyscrapers in downtown Hong Kong. There is a teen movie aesthetic to some of the shots (the green screen work is jarring and distracting) but even the sexiness of those candy company girls cannot lighten the winds at any one second clocking in at 100 mph inside tornadoes – and it is often lamentable the need in many films to stick a sexy woman in there/here to lighten the tension. One almost expects Bill Engvall to jump out of the car, belch and ask Jennifer Love Hewitt

Tuscany, the story involves a troubled birth, with three people being having their eyes punctured and tips of their fingers cut off by the young son. His parents try to shut things down, lest it may lead to unnecessary negative outcomes, but it's too late. The initial title was I denti del drago (The Dragon's Teeth), but it was changed. And while it was basically a giallo and actually shot like one, the film contains so many other elements, right down to some art-house scenes, it may deserve its own feel. The first half is slow by normal standards, but I liked it better than the latter half, in which the whole thing slows down and Troma claims all hell breaks loose. It actually didn't come as a surprise that the film was Fulci's directorial debut, as he displayed some early talent here. One thought while watching the VHS: Whoever invented blue eye shadow needs to have their face pushed, repeatedly, into a toilet bowl with urine and other unknown substances. Mi ruba il cuore was actually shot in 1.33 full frame, even though some of the Troma video labels were not that great, appearing to be 1.78 or even 1.66. This was especially noticeable during the night scenes in the pastoral areas. I was also a bit surprised for
only one movie in their lives. Even some of the "best" movies. I'm not trying to appologize for people being people so to speak but surely somebody is out there who has an open mind. That's all I'm looking for. But unfortunately that is hardly to come by IMHO ! I understand that day and night I'm in the minority. I think my clssical reference has given me a wider perspective of entertainment than others around here. Not that any of us haven't seen hundreds of movies collectively. It's still the open mind. I'm sorry but nearly everybody lauds "Wall Street" and that movie is total crap. Also, there is nothing great about "The Outsiders" it's about as sappy, sickening and manipulative as it gets. There is nearly no measure of taste (I know, a subjective concept) any more. Everybody who sees every crappy movie that comes out just automatically lays some kind of praise on it because they want to be the first kid on the block with the new "hot" movie. Kind of like when you were young and had one of the newest sneakers or had a new video game, couldn't wait to go to school and tell everybody 'cause you were cool. As to narrative, well listen, all the best films have winning narratives. And the very
movies aped higher-profile theatrical releases, here they embraced camp. From a script that combined more sweeping subject matter (the closing of a mountain resort due to Global Warming) with a smaller story in the vein of Tales of the City, Ordeal in the Arctic embraced its own tackiness by adding performances of the film's theme tune (composed by Van Dyke's brother Chris) by LOVE HINTS and Lonna Kelley, as well as guest appearances from Jerry Mathers, Lance O'Brien and Van Dyke himself. Russell Johnson made his last full-length celluloid appearance. Shot the same year as Van Dyke's Bionicle movie, this is a film clearly targeting the same demographic. Score night: A three-hour TV movie that spans the last seven decades and life cycle of a mountain resort chronicles the demise of that resort in a way that mums and their kids can both watch together. Even though there are obvious similarities between the two films, somehow the Bionicle one manages to look far more pellucid and immersive. Well-worn technological jiggery-pokery elevates some of the generic performances. Here, it feels false, a tad jarring to watch a CGI bear interact with otherwise physical characters on the soundstage,

Mind you, if Alena Kodentsova had been timed on the Stampede Express yesterday, the score might have been 4-4, surely. Still, it beats stress and cuts into less leafy wood. Or probably not.

best one. Not so with the PP films: you can pick any one of them and judge its merits on their own. For this review I chose to return to the OG and see if my rating holds. Well, my rating for number one still holds, but over time has slid down to 2.5 stars. What the fuck? Well, I feel like these early drug-trip hallucinatory episodes don't hold up well because they have not yet learned to restrain themselves within a specific structure. This is not to say that there ARE NO sturcture to be found here, but that, despite oftentimes ornate sets, there just overbearing glop going a lot places and doing many crazy shit without any reason it should have be fairly apparent. What this movie does, and it does well, is cram into twenty minutes more ideas than about every other fantasy movie since 1967. This is an orgy of shit that would have made Jerry Lewis blush. Even now, 35 years on it still behooves journey into madness and back. SO: participating are your hostess Kitty Von Hardcore (dressing the set in her glory hole dress and letading the peeping folks like a plastered bombay Sal): Maria Ford nicknamed the "orange bitch" most likely because her name is Fox and
of Saints Row 3". The boxart looks bad as well, almost like something someone would do for an amateur game or a "sister" game to Ion Storm's Daikatana. The game appears to be a video game equivalent of things you can see in Hollywood nowadays where mix adequate acting with CGI, artificial effects, and digital film and then market it under the premise that it's actually "Live Action" but it's not............ Yeah, it was horrible. The movie is 40 years old, making it really old news. Why spend more money to remake the effects and market it as something new????? Effing Stupid!!! I can see money perhaps for Saints Row 3 to somehow make a Spin Off with ONLY Syndicate. MAYBE it would work but I think "wasted money" popped in a lot of gamer's heads!! Sorry to diss the game but look at the poster "from the FX team of Saints Row 3".......... Your memory will remember it!!! The made a movie over 10 YEARS AGO in CHAOS and Wreckage I think you'll find. It had 2 missions and that was one with aircraft and SCA face cards. Was that supposed to last people until now? I'd prefer just Universe or worse Chaos & Wreckage

on who gets to be a higher rank or closer to the mob leader. The venue is an old theatre and everything spectaclez and whatnot. I thought that was pretty awesome. As well, the rival mobsters are the most hyped up and mind blowingly awesome entrance theme and music ever. Yes, in a way the movie also focuses on corruption, but even with the game being in triads, the outcome is just a way to give justice. No violence is allowed on each event (I'm not sure what was their excuse though), so how the triads last all these time is beyond me. Check out the movie and review here. Election gives out awesome characters through majestic music and intense videography. I've enjoyed watching it head to toe, the characters portrayed are just so charismatic that I find it hard to look away. You'll root for this guy, feel bad for them, and in some point, you may just hate em all or you might just love everybody. Is Election a good movie? The movie is definitely good. It gives off a story that is easy for the audience to understand. Despite being in triads, you'll love and hate em. It's moive I could watch again, and again, and again. Election is not a movie you want to miss. There's a part 2 too! Another movie as good as Election? Same
but at the same time Brown of Harvard, produced in 1941, is no less charming for its nice but simple filmmaking style. The source of Brown of Harvard's charm is not in special effects, special circumstance, or even great dialog. The charm comes from its casting and acting. It's easier to forgive Brown of Harvard's thinness and smallness than it is to forgive the producers for missing a significant opportunity involving one of the central characters. The star of Brown of Harvard is Ronald Reagan. But the movie doesn't even begin to fit Reagan into the role he played two decades year later as President of the United States. Why was that so? Is it true that actors take a little bit from every role they perform into their next one? Could it be that Reagan had to wait so that he could become Ronald Reagan before he could play the President of the United States? Specs and monkeys. How interesting. Enjoy Brown of Harvard. It's a very amiable film that wants to please and succeeds. We watched it for you. Now it's your turn to watch it. Press play. And Happy Halloween!

was also disappointed to see that the movie turned out to be mediocre. At best, the movie is an ordinary action thriller with an average screenplay that goes no further than delivering on the action scenes. But sadly, it feels like there are missing scenes and that the movie would have been better off being a TV series instead of a movie. Yet since it's their debut, and since entertainment value alone seems to be the only selling point of this movie, they're off to a good start. I just hope the movie will be more entertaining, more action-packed, in the next installment of this franchise. 1/5. Not bad but not great either. Won't watch again. Maybe on the day the sequel comes out. Review on Pubgrande.com. Mabuhay ang movie!

made - Seasons 1, 2, and 3 ALL had the same style prop flowers that had been used on the Star Trek sets since the first pilot was created. As mentioned earlier in the book, none of the computer props or anything like that were re-used so it would make no sense that the flowers were. If you look at the 1966 episodes it looks like they had the same style plant on the bridge but if you look patiently at the Jim Nimoy poster on his Galaxy Posters website for the bridge from this season, it's plain to see that it appears to be a different style leafy plant. The episode "Spectre of the Gun" (also written by David P. Harmon) had the same producers, D.C. Fontana and Gene Roddenberry) so it makes sense that the studio would have gone to the TNG first season sets to get the plants used because it saved them some money, which Universal does in nearly every aspect of filmmaking. However, there's absolutely no evidence of any plants routinely being re-used like they did with all of the electronic props (and even each of the furniture would usually change position slightly every week - if you look at Kirk's chair in his quarters in Season 1, it appears to be the same chair but in Season 3 the chair is rotated about 10 degrees to the left.)
has been in the past. Now the plebs have got back to work we can put the old sack and bread on and be absolutely no good to anyone. All except for the 660+ new MP's who all seem to be on "allowances" which basically mean they have a job for life. They will be sitting in the Houses of Whingeing and moaning like a dog with a bad tick till they can get upstairs on our dime to a perceived job with a title.

movie. Yuk, might be a better word. Les Patterson and the mockery of the martial arts isn't my idea of a good joke. The screamy soundtrack was enough to make me play some Sonic Youth orcode. I even took notes to see if any of the older, better martial arts films were ripped off. As far as I could tell, no martial arts move was duplicated...although there were a few kickfights ... to keep me interested as well as in the spirit of such an odious video that I was watching. This movie is bad. Pythagoras said it and I live by it. Charleton Heston is in the movie; maybe it's not a movie then, but a movie set? I think it's awfully easy to be hard on a movie set...I mean hey, they're not actually in the desert, right? They're on the studio lot, in a big warehouse. There's a Pyramid in the movie (and the movie called HASTINGS WAY and a Peter Weir movie called THE PRESTIGE and the movie called THE 10TH KINGDOM as well as a KILGOUR/SIDDIQU metaphysics class, I believe, that surmounts the killing of this movie and many others. But I'm not going to waste
to tears and almost missing my own birthday party! haha! And it left a message about freedom, true love, and friendship that everyone can relate to, in hope of inspiring them to take a risk and strive for their own freedom, pushing the boundaries and hurdle that is limiting us to open this heart and embrace the whole world of endless possiblities waiting for us to seize. And like I said, that's enough for a 2.5 hours movie WITHOUT the love story. I prefer not to talk too much about it but I'd like to say that there's no such thing as pure love. everyone has their own scruples and prejudices only natural, and as long as the one who's in love is aware of what they got to the point that they know the feeling is not shallow, and can forgive the other faults and drawbacks, clear and true as long as they meant it. True love encompasses the whole being of another person, knowing the good and the bad, and still wanted to feel baffled and giddy. It is a beautiful feeling that I wished/hoped everyone can experience. Watch the movie. Just take my words for it and judge for yourself after watching the movie. That's all that I'm going to say, no matter how much I wanted to reveal it to you all. :) You
collections of medallions were intriguing. Try attributing the story idea of 'The Odyssey' to (say) the Thirties. It's great fun. The old story itself is predominantly Greek ... The Greeks didn't care much for Nature or the Roman idea of sea pantheism either. The Odyssey was Norman Thrower's first book. By the time a film was planned, several Hollywood books were in print - mainly for Franklin W. Dixion or Bryan Foy. They were solid stories for a small number of films. Two of them, My Odyssey and SEVEN FACES OF MYSTERY (1934) have now come to light, but remain unavailable at the time of writing. Britain's Ealing Studios did turn out a wonderful ode to Greek mythology with STRANGER'S GATE (1940), by an American, Thornton Freeland, scripting from a story treatment by Astrid Andersen (the sales copy).лли 2005.

this version, which incidentally hires Mrs. Potts as a receptionist, the story is silly, cloying, and the CGI is unconvincing. It looks like a computer generated cartoon. With a twisted plot, annoying characters, and predictable conclusion, this version doesn't put a frog in the fire or make a film chestnut into a pleasant surprise. The actors accomplish nothing. The music (with two exceptions) is unimpressive. The only metal object shown (that's where the fiefdom he was set on ends up) is the necklace Lily hocks. Not surprising it's the same shape as Belle's hairpiece. Howard's directorial style, uneven at best, doesn't become him on this one. If the film is a success we can expect Walt Disney Productions to authorize remaking every Tom Hanks comedy autobiography. Since this is being marketed as a musical the obvious on the horizon is the Mouse crashing Broadway. Oh my. What's this? Howard's next project is Solo: A Star Wars Story. Go figure. Probably a nutty professor or late night talk show comedy. The other show business joke made in this film is the band Beastie Boys becoming a jazz ensemble. Guess this is meant to be funny. Maybe it's not so funny when a cartoon is
see it in real .. too much expectations and its finished now ,i can't gather my pieces now .Do the writers of supernatural fail to understand the love that they get from their fans after so many years of expectations. If they weren't so good writers it is impossible to keep the same recurring fans. They are spoiling everything by ruining the queen and important characters. Please don't dare to kill him. I can't beleive that they can do that. I really hope that they won't go too far from book events. Please respect the fans. They aren't like many other crazy fuckings who aren't sane. They love GRRM for what he wrote not for what they show on the screen i swear don't you dare to kill. I am afraid deano might lose his head anytimeon the screen . These things are no lie that frustrated me the most in his series. If some more character die its going to be the end. The best character of the lead died now i don't care if they die or not but please please please they shouldn't kill the queen , Eddard , robert and he is the one i care the most. Swear I am gonna leave watching the series if they kill him on the screen.I know he is a fake character but i hope that he won't die.It will be all
of garbage in the 8's or 9's is a total idiot, nothing about this went well on any level. Danny McBride is Danny Mcbride, he is who he is and people either love him or hate him, there is no in between on this, this movie is not the movie to sit down and watch on a Saturday afternoon and crack a beer and enjoy. It's a bad movie, badly made, and a very popular and annoying actor is glued to the center of it with his idiotic friends, drama queens and big name actors surrounding him and no real way of showing the viewer that he is definately in the wrong role for this movie. I realize no premier Director or Actor would want to be involved with this movie, if the show wasn't coming up on its 22nd year on the air, there would be no chance that this script would make it to the movie theatres and end up getting green lit. My advice is RUN not walk away from this steaming pile of soon to be obsolete trash, try to let your kids see Tarantino's brilliance and corruption with SKINNY DIPPING SCENES once again pulling in dumber everyday vapid failures over and over again, with disgusting stunts and and shows that he has to repeate now that he has
has just broken up with his girlfriend so he goes to his cousin Lizzie and asks her to come to the movies with him making up a lie that he assumes she'll have no reason to call him on -- little does he know he has enlghtened her most. The bit when she's having fun at his expense over the phone is very funny, and when she finally meets up with him at the movies... oh.... so funny! This was probably my favorite short out of all the ones that I've seen. I'd say it's a big improvement over the first three and I liked the ending better than the way the other ones ended. :) Enjoy this one!

say it's good really. Passenger was a challenging film that dragged more than many of its competitors from 1964 but in doing so provoked thought and a mixed reaction afterward than being told a heavy-handed tale of morality or politics. With a reference to The Hirondelle, it sometimes could be a little lame, but it was sweeping enough to make you sit with bated breath.Even if I had to put up with the dodgy anachronistic German subtitling. Bless you foreigners for inventing this wonderful device of the subtitled film. Bless you. (Damn Spielberg, he should thank Spielberg...) Alas, Pastandjong was in it and like the Star Wars crew I felt like ripping my hair out in the crucial moment. Anyone else still have a suspicious lump in their throat at the end? Hurts like a foil badge from the 80s? They said no to Jack Charlton? And yet they say yes to that happy sausage Magnussen? No, I don't get it either. Lovely to see you after your 'mysterious illness' insist the makers of the film. Oops, scratch that! You never saw me, we never had this conversation.

the bigscreen i've ever had the fortune of watching. this is a movie about one of the most basic themes: attraction, physical and otherwise. there is no opponent driving the lovers apart here - besides themselves. there are no plot developments that seem forced for the sake of a complex storyline. this drifts along organically and doesn't need tricks, effects, or corny singing. i will admit that first 20-30 min and the last 10-15 min of this movie is a little iffy for me, it's just sort of a big plate full of creepy mushrooms disguised as plot filler, and they are inserted into the movie in order to resolve things emphatically. the acting is fab - matthew modine and natalia kapchuk are undeniably and palpably attracted to one another - a fact so plainly demonstrated that it even comes through on the composed faces of the actors. gina gershon is, i admit, a surprising addition to the cast, but one i greatly welcome even considering that she plays naive idiots in most movies i've seen her in. the other upper-cast members are great as well, each one leaving his or her mark in the form of one particular, telling symbol. in all, this movie sort of plods and rambles, even with a

commercials rate higher than the movie itself, and when that commercial is a featureless spaceship going into its final overload stage in a mono-tone grey space of similar, unchanging black. Imagine the spaceship at the end of "2001", or the Dust Bowl spacescape in "2061" as seen from Earth. Those were space scenes. This is merely a space. The camera never left the cockpit. I got punchy for long stretches of this movie, and still the acting felt more like Denys Arcand trying to emulate "Apocalypse Now". The whole movie was a cookie cutter copy of the movie the audience had just seen before. All we really want to know from the movie is whether the people in the spaceship are going to "turn the ship wrong or right", as the captain said, or not. The rest of it is irrelevant. (This movie features unbelievable primitive space technology. Everybody else already has gravity drives and no-action control. Heck...) At any rate, we wound up at a Laser tag game on Christmas night afterward with a lot of odd looking Norwegians. They're rather odd-looking. Really. Every guy in there had a cast on one leg. And blond, rather "lemmingish" (as Julia's cousin put it) hair. There were a few
at the 45 minute mark – which was around the time that the atmosphere starts and there is no comedy for the next hour and a half. I assure you they did not go wrongly labeled, they did in fact see the Censored G Version – the version of Saw that I do not recommend watching, and only went to see because the reviews said the original version (Uncut) was far too much for anyone not used to the horror genre because of its gory and tasteless nature (although some people come out saying that the Censored version was actually the better one). The thing is, David Hack labeled the film as being lacklustre before he even saw it! The film is possibly one of the best films of last year: it is not extremely intimidating yet it is not tame either. Hack cream the film as being ‘transparent’ which is crazy. The film is completely mysterious and Philosopher Jigsaw is a big part to this, as we naturally question his motives. The build up to his identity is great fun and you don’t know whether you should fear or sympathise with him. The characters are developed within such a short space of time; it’s fantastic to get to know them like this and are seldom stereotyped. The film does at some points make you uncomfortable to watch as the scenarios are so
sense at all, which precisely is the definition of art!!! Must go see this movie. It is about the director's own father who was an évantailadores (gambler). It looks like the director, Luca Guadagnino, also has a touch of it too. The movie was shot in Turin, Foggia, Altobrugge, and Berlin. Che bello. There seems to be very strong similitudes with met his "Boy's life" movie (or others) but instead of being a poor minor from a far away country, this nonguentop is a rich eccentric from the north Italy. Among his many eccentricities is the passion for European opera, gambling, and the bottletops collection of "ginois". Yeah, sure, but you gotta be there in order to get it. Check this movie. Five stars, unquestionably. And it has a reasonable budget, beautifully acting, stunning sets, and a moving sound track or narrative. I mean, come on, Luca Guadagnino is giving Roberto Benegi Italian cinema back in style. Perfect translation for this movie, straightforward and very accurate. Do I need to say that I had a blast reading the subtitles? Mamma mia, one of the best, the best actually. Particularly, the last shots. Five stars, no two ways

's atmosphere has little in common with the Lord of the Rings. And that's exactly because it is a parody. That's what separates it from the preceeding, disastrous The Second Part (that one I'm planning on seeing) and pretty much all high fantasy in general (that's four movies, calculated to be about 9 hours and more during a single week, during a single decade). Everything that would make this a decent movie is executed so well that nobody would be surprised. Legolas took a great leap of faith in order to save Gimli, and in doing so proved that all nice guys are not dumb. That's an epic scene, and from everything presented it was a completely pointless fact to be known. In the forthcoming economic dimensions of the movie's characters (and scenes, more importantly) every hero's part has been assigned including stats, and all of them have the same stats, with minimal variations accounted for. Unexpected disco parties when one of the heroes is about to face an important confrontation is a mainstay and is always interesting, when you remember that they have budgets to burn and explosions to blow (from all possible objects). Two cueballs versus thousands of horrinal doppelgangers is just another scene, in which our heroes prove their courage but really fail to help the masses at all.

Catcher in the Rye reboot vibe, no Bloom, but the drama (and mommy issues) come heavily from that. I’ve had this feeling for a while, but this turned out to be an exquisite exploration of (almost) being a baby. Seeing my daughter pick up a stone today made me realise that she’s preparing to leave me, something we’ve been avoiding for 13 years. I’ve been struggling to accept that a feature of maturation is the inevitable reconfiguration of relationships. So many good reviews, so much promise. I wanted to like it—and I did!

misleading, so please note that this thread is AU, dealing with "dramion" and I will be spoiling some good parts of the saga (I hope really, really good) because this has to part of the summary. This has no point to the summary, read the story about some things I agree Artemis is completely awesome, and nothing annoys me more than demthenon (we all know how much Artemis "liked her".) These are still my views, I don't know how to change them, and this is unrelated to the information that I have been obtaining through fanfiction.net (which is why I stopped writing it). Please don't hate me... =) I don't know how to change I supose, the only thing I ask is that it is know that this is based on my views, nothing else, so I ask for your forgiveness. Hm..that's it, I think. =) *move on* I love draconic the mythic winged unicorn will take you down if you don't please her.

...at least not these days. There was just something about this film that I loved from the opening credits onwards and it returns me to Tamarind Island, 1977ish and a few friends watching movies in my friend's parents' "den", rather than the barren desert of the empty threebedroom that meant I'd sleep on the plastic-covered couch in the LIVING ROOM of the a 40yearold man with music posters and EASY RIDER and such. Oh brother...my mistake I was beguiled by the movie as well as Pit and Bobbie Sue...AND THE BIGGAMEBOYS back then and there was a novelty and innocence to it years before it would become passe with "Midnight Movies" "Rocky Horror" and such...And when I got to see the place lived in (inside!!) with no outside phone and as others have discussed, barefoot running around and blasting the rock and roll ON TOP OF THE GUN SMOKE TV SHOW at the end of the night. All dreamy stuff. The nude stuff just slipped in on me...maybe even softened the blow of "pornography" which I HATED and that was my last word on it then for a long time...and they play this at midnight anyway.

primarily at the Japanese family market – not as extensive as that of the United States but still consider a mine of raw materials for the film industry – and obviously intends to become a strong confident oeuvre in the world of anime, that is the sort of films mostly watched by children. Yet it wraps up its wondrous adventure through fantasy and fable with a clear allusion (short of being abstruse) to Mahabharata: the collision between two worlds becomes the backdrop for the confrontation between heroes, who in that case come from the balcony of the Western history of painting and illustrious artists. Rather than conquering the world through technological or industrial power, this animated film obtained an Oscar nomination for the track of Danny Elfman (known for Tim Burton's film of the same genre), and a Golden Globe nomination for the voice of Eduardo Verástegui. Without that this would be a nice fantastic adventure from a film culture that clearly contains influences of even greater films like Don Bluth's The Black Cauldron (which will perhaps be remembered as the first and last computer-animated film in history, so much so that the documentary Waking Sleeping Beauty carried out a genre renovation in this sort of cinema after decades of sequels).

witnesses to admit that the father is coaching the daughter to say something. When this fails, he leads Giegold in the direction and eventually the witnesses say it was Giegold who did it. Giegold then confesses to the crime. Van Den Broeck is unhappy with this and gets him out of the prison for which he was particiapated. Van Den Broeck later overrids the plan to kill both Giegold and Rose Dobry by unplugging his car during intercept. In the end he marries Rose Dobry and Ford ambiguiously suggests that they replaced Dutch's son who possibly inherited the Nazi genes. This was also the first movie to use the so-called "Dutch angle." Dutch angle - a visual device, is an angle rotated with the vertical line of the frame in a way that presents a slanted look at a scene. The first use of a Dutch angle shot can be dated back to 1928, when F.W. Murnau used several in his American film, “4 Devils“. However, it is not until 1971, when Martin Scorsese made the film “Mean Streets“, that the “Dutch angle shooting technique” was named. This is partly due to the fact that Scorsese used the Dutch angle heavily in this film and “Mean Streets” was also filmed in the Dutch regions of

plot has little to do with reality but fortunately Condon’s wonderful, ornate prose means you’ll have a pretty good time reading it. A shoddy rewrite of 1962’s fairytale version proves intriguingly unnecessary. In fact, they’re both better off without each other, proving there was nothing to be told. Helen Morgan as Jacqueline Kennedy was the least unsatisfying element of this project. But as Charlie’s Angels have already shown, anything with John F. Kennedy is better off without John Huston. So man up, compromise, and look for Cape Fear on streaming instead, remembering that 1988’s Red Fox proves that Chris Sarandon has a cameo that’ll blow your mind. It's The Machurian Candidate time flies by in this plodding, inconsequential remake. The after-effect of the 60s left a lot to be desired, and this tantamount to an X-Files' rip the Frost and famously attempts to show the 60s wasn't as groovy or wholesome as some would have you believe. Paired with the voice over narration, the effect for me at least is to try and view the 60s with a sense of detachment which I'm not sure an historical drama makes for a particularly compelling thriller
what he himself said and criticized, as I believe this gives me a good basis from which to critique the film. I will keep my comments as vague as possible for those who haven�t noticed yet this movie is in theatres and don�t know that it contains spoilers. I will admit straight out, I did like it. I think it was great. Good acting and atmosphere. But I can understand why many Tolkien fans are extremely disappointed. As Tolkien writes himself: �The possibility of The Legendary Cycle {The Lord of the Rings} I regard as small. But I have had not unlikely news that encourages me to hope that the result, were it to appear, might prove an improvement upon anything of the kind that has been so far in print, largely because of my having tried, knowingly or unknowingly, to follow in faith more literally the style of story-telling, if not also in some of the incidents and the stage-setting of the hobbit-themes. All the same I cannot see my way to completing it for some long time to come. And in the meantime I shall perhaps turn my mind to something else, and if so should it be my fortune to make a good and �popular� thing, I shall not mind � [a strikethrough adds ironically:] but only hope[.] {The Letters of J.R.
film, was outstanding. It lingers with you, constantly playing inside your head long after the film is finished. The early parts of the film which really sets things off; from the football game to the local pub, just makes you want to gripe and complain but then you realize, this happened. Women everywhere have experienced this kind of behavior. Here were all these very strong, compelling, and believable characters, and watching it was somewhat like watching a train wreck. You want to turn away because you know it's so bad, yet you and can't. Loved this film! Thought-provoking, highly emotional, and powerful! Worth watching!! Maybe best film to date for James Brosnan! Excellent! Don't miss it! A definite MUST SEE!! Looking forward to the DVD, so I can watch it over and over again! R.I.P. Bridget and Lisa, who have inspired a multitude of people to follow the path of what will hopefully help many women from being abused by their loved ones.

rambling. The must see documentary is ''The atomic Bomb: the race to build the worlds first nuclear weapon''. This show has got some fantastic interviews with key people involved. Watching this very clever and funny film is like stepping completely outside of oneself and inhabiting someone else ''POV''. I can highly recommend it and really hope that the series makes its way to DVD. But back to ''Blackholes''. Once Kip kept the optimistic buzz going I can almost ignore his glaringly obvious departure from scientific reasoning with the notion that there is a growing schism between conventional physics and metaphysics. We are all of spiritual constitution but physics is purely physical. Some weirdos thought they found imprints of atoms on their pictures when those atoms were invisible. Who didn't know that electrons make pictures when smashing into film? This type of presentation seems to want to explore complex mathematical abstractions further. But this proclivity seems based on a contagious mental illness. Particle/anti-particle dualism - just on for ''Black Holes''. Which are infinitely large or too small to pick up on ''Gravity Probe B''. Tony Tye - an experimentalist mentions future proofing in a lab that more than one physicist lauds ''possibly''. Rather odd given that physicist have emitted much bluster in recent
slips through the front door of his home, he's confronted by a Kalashnikov-toting Judicial Official (Kurt Jurgen). It seems as if embezzlement is a capital crime in this alternate world (assuming you stole a fair amount of money), and while Ustinov had escaped the police, he now had to dodge the long arm of the law. He's determined not to turn himself in, and sets out to collect his daughter (Simone Signoret), and learn from her the whereabouts of a much larger sum of money that he has buried. The man was a thief, and he can't help being one, even as he insists that he's tried to reform and to be honest. He collects a couple of crooks-in-training, Kenny (Robert Vaughn) and Boris (David McCallum), to help him locate his ill-gotten gain. We later learn with some trepidation that one of the rogues, Boris, blabbed to the Judicial Official the address of Ustinov's friend and lawyer (Maximilian Schell). Ustinov's character can be reprehensible but likeable. Even at the risk of having lopped off a limb, he's not above using force not to abandon his plans. This movie's absurd and unexpected plot
there is no comparison between the superb Jack Hawkins and Bond extras where the women in addition to being cheap had its’ cleavage accented. The girl on the climbing rope just stays there. The plot brushes all the politics aside and removes all the suspense from The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. James Bonds attempts at fitting in by cuff linking and acts of self sacrifice aren’t even secret or clever. For a totally realistic movie it looks like l think wasn’t intended. Too many action sequences and fist fights should have been left for another movie. Richard Burton’s Alec Leamas dies in a stunt and not the way he did in the 1965 classic. Yes, Tinker Tailor would have been the better choice. 4 stars. The spy I enjoyed 20 times more was in The Kremlin Letter where I loathe the ending of. Sean Connery had no dynamics in this adaptation. This movie could be marketed to misogynists because only women who look like the actresses from Greece appear. London has been Hollywoodnized. I am sure The Quentin family made major contributions to the authenticity of the story. I don’t know how you can make a throw away picture 130 minutes long. Overall a dull disappointment. Those people who think this movie
, you'd expect it to be so much better than it is. But it's just very clumsily put together, badly written, badly plotted and by the end teeters on the edge of incoherence. The high point, for me, was a brief cameo as one of the villain's security chiefs by David Harbour of Stranger Things fame. Otherwise a big let down. Jennifer Lopez's fans will be off the hook, though; I felt the she could pull off every aspect of character but shooting well. Conviction and the rest isn't exactly ludicrous, nor is it worse than many big budget heist movies of recent years, each is just as bad in different ways. Avoid it like the plague and read Adrian McKinty's Gun Street Girl instead. And laugh.? A lot.? BTW how else does a schoolboy call an Arizona state senator who got expelled from the Republican party during the May 2015 primary? US elections are stupid, but that's embarrassing.!? But then maybe this idiot did win re-election in the end. What?!!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!???!!!!!!??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
made so incomprehensible by the cut rate filmed history lessons presented along the way. A bunch of clips from movies, documentaries, etc were inserted occasionally with minimal context to explain events that were too complicated for the viewer to follow the timelines and/or relationships. Not for the Jane of the footlong Sub Club. Even if one gets past all that garbage and follows the story of the gunslinger as directed, it makes very little sense! If that would have been a hallway to a profound climax, the doors would have been painted shut. "Journey" needs to go back to film school and learn how to make a film. This is not the "trip" you should be on! Flunk! P.S., the movie is a docudrama based on fact, but the facts are actually pretty surprising and not in keeping with what's in this movie!

Mr. Gray knows his stuff as well. But to make a movie like this is just plain wrong. A guy is a Wolfman in every sense of the word. A psychopath. A man who enjoys slasher movies, enjoys killing people. However, he has this amazingly beautiful girlfriend and that makes for bad times. Gradually, the girlfriend starts cheating on him with an ex , the Wolfman does not take this well. So the guy goes on a killing spree? And his final kill is a highly profitable as well as grotesque one. Yes, it is full of Hot scenes, hard-core sex, SPOILER AHEAD kinky bondage and some very entertaining Curling and Cricket. Some of the stuff gets really good and entertaining and a couple of times wholly amusing. As always when a serial killer gets caught, there is a chatty lawyer who listens to the plea of the Wolfman and goes for everything when his client starts explaining. However, this movie is just too dumb. It is difficult to really get into the movie and enjoy the good stuff. Another thing I didn't care much for was the understated performance of the actor who plays The Wolfman. But I guess the "actor" knows what he is doing. The film is not really scary, not really entertaining. Then if you enjoy a fair share of
tales of conquest. Cennobites, True Romance, Heathers and so many horrific comedies don't even come close to describing the trials and tribulations of the Greaser Caf Mag Nation who are disillusioned with the opposite sex. Dominique, Leah, Bobby and Monty all have stories to tell that turn out to be anything but true romances. They're stuck with their eternal day jobs and the fact that they're not getting any; yet they think they're standing tall above their lecherous West Side nemeses who will stop at nothing to get the goods on Greaser Caf. Those horrors are easy enough to swallow when they congregate on Saturday nights at the NYC diner where they think women exist solely for their sexual pleasure.

wife starts experiencing strange phenomena. This prospective satire witnesses plenty of conflicts through spying, eavesdropping, betrayal and much more. It also takes its theme to the extreme, distorting contemporary values and cleverly drawing caricatures of characters. Cam [CONSELVIER] and company are as ruthless as ever with their fine-tuned satire and symbolism work. They offer caustic observations of reality and remind audiences how manipulative some of today's relationships can be. Shutting out the noise of the outside world, one can only focus on what is inside of one's mind. In one moment, the essence of a person comes to life in an extraordinary way. With photographs, costumes, and dialogue, this film brilliantly collaborates playful musicality. It seeks to expand beyond the entire realm of stage and chair. By fusing the pleasure of music with visual and auditory elements, this film effectively elevates the level of entertainment.

the architectural styles of the day. The vast variety of architectural design available, many of it highly experimental because moral concerns are not widely encouraged, can be fascinating. Yet it is a claustrophobic city and a place where you are constantly under the watchful gaze of the police everywhere. Odd, considering that I’ve never seen a place with so many robberies with people wearing balaclavas who, in the time it takes to pull your wallet out while the pickpockets around you are doing the same thing to someone else, will have your money. I suppose that the police are busy elsewhere. I file those disturbing images just as Mars predicted but at the following stop the anticipated asteroid that kills the Kryptonite doesn’t quite hit me right in the head. One of those cars with the blinding headlights that is only a minor annoyance elsewhere hits me. Now that could break the barrier, being translated to another reality. It’s funny how often things that begin one way or another can go off in another direction at another time. Then there were those colourful pills. One texture, another and another arguing in the form of grand theories that would contort and mutter in a kind of synchronised rap. I should have gone with my instinct but a fellow passenger got his head blown off because of sticking his head out of the train,
shrewd, realistic character study and thoughtful fiction along the lines of Joan Didion's stories of life in California in the 1950s. It's got more than a little of the bite that characterized some of the earlier Howard Hawks films such as "To Have and Have Not" and "Only Angels Have Wings," in tracing the relationships that anger, ego, class and social pre-rights hostility among men and women are capable of causing, at their own peril. What makes the narrative work as successfully as it does is Ms. Theresa Russell, an innovative, appealing actress who's come to Cannes with performing coups behind her under the direction of Robert Altman in "Short Cuts," P. T. Anderson in "Boogie Nights," Ted Demme to the experience of "The Ref," and in Todd Haynes' "Married in America." She had already figured out in Bell's film how to make these quick little relationship murders pay off. (Ms. Russell has been coming to Cannes festivals and the Telluride Film Festival since "The Razor's Edge" in 1984, in search of the right statement for her array of talents. She is the daughter of Josephine Hutchinson.) What the fact is almost that she knows how to heighten Ms. Didion'

the time, but my memories of it are vague, and I had no clue who the filmmakers were. So when I say that Augie Pasto is one of the coolest filmmakers you've probably never heard of, just know that I mean what I say. His Perennial Film Studios have made some remarkable stuff. The man can dance masterfully all the way over the line between beautiful and grotesque, and the point at which you're not laughing as much as wondering, "Is this a joke?" To SEA OF DUST.

Not into electronic music, they were clearly not happy to be there, taking every opportunity to berate the crowd. If we went, we went reluctantly, and they gave us very little reason to leave our chef prepared dinner tables and return to the dancefloor. If these people ever played live music it would be abrasive to the point of nonsense, and who are they to tell me that they deserve a platform better than what I give them? The chefs remained in the kitchen, probably sniggering. This is trash, anybody got smut? Comparing any version of dub with Rancid Aluminium is tough. Lee Scratch Perry's music is, in its most futuristic form, playful. When Joe Gibbs collaborated with King Tubby, he was innovating, trying to find new ways to play with stereo and tape delay. Peckings @ First Word was the opposite. There was nothing fun to be had last night, and for
the atrocities committed by him. Mao would also attack Stalin in his Little Red Book. There was a rush to copy all the negative aspects of the West in fiction and even in architecture Josef Krier says in his interview here that some of the great post-modern architects privileged madness and imitation of the past over heroic attempts to build high-rise apartment blocks in the Soviet Union. While people say 1989 was the end of Communism nothing was really decided then. All the clocks stopped in 1956. A thermostat was installed in life to keep all generations at the respectful same distance from Communism with none none enjoying consistent progress from that year till now. What makes Kundera’s formulations so brilliant is his grasp of that permanent limbo as a metaphor. He constructs a scenario where every generation feels like it’s Beethoven inside – a genius but misunderstood. The Old Left tries to live the 1917 October Revolution. The New Left tries to recapture 1968. And in Germany the publisher Kiepenheuer either is a member of the Bauhaus where the Stalinist others view him as the enemy. It all starts with smashing the innocent Beethoven bust to start New Times. As Benjamin says ““There will be continuing proletarianization of ever

Two years after they moved out of Bottom's old residence of 38 Gledhow Drive, TV's favourite tramps are returning to Elm Ridge to star in a one-off animated TV film. The Bottoms Leaving Home animated special will air on the popular online anime clip show Ani-Mates, airing at around 11pm on Friday, April 27th and 28th, and here's the synopsis: "Bacon Brisket and Hedge are back in a new, animated adventure with their legendary friend Mude. After twenty years away from home, the three tramps return to find that life has changed a lot for the worse, so a series of devious schemes are devised in an attempt to remedy the situation."

its messages and visual symbology. It was amazing, breathtaking, astounding, and so very many more remarks to mention. The involvement and the message though? Not so much. If you look at it with an aware eye, you'll see that this film actually tries to "fix" an artistic approach towards Ceremony. Opening with the scene of a cook preparing a cow's tongue, carefully slicing it to set out just the right portion, is exactly how Pixar running this show would've assembled it. At the end, after that lungсмотреть онлайн соattributes failed to hold them back, the cook even prepares and eats another (and maybe a little larger) slice, rendering the analogy even tighter. The messages, however, were (with the notable exception soon outlined) rather weak and generic in comparison to other Pixar masterpieces. There are mercilessly obvious shots and comments, almost painfully forcing the audience to understand the essence they're after and therefore choking out any other more personal involvements/perceptions. For instance, be it the parallel montage shot in the middle of the film or the overly)-explanatory commentary of the poised dia de los muertos/dressed up Santa, it was just way too noticeable and (in comparison to other Pixar films
rumors of the plague are left without any explanation, but the major idea is the brooding obsession that the writer had with a young boy, whom he saw at a step pool in a resort on the Adriatic Sea. Unlike the book, the movie is explicitly dramatic with a vivid indirection, reverberated by the heavenly melancholy of the music. The film provides necessary motives that were only hinted in the book, also it adds a backing of the religious moral. The ingenuous music creates the atmosphere reminiscent of an innocent romance, which inevitably reminds of a eighth-century Italian painter Botticelli''s picture with Venus and Mars. Varnedal loosens his elegant tie, puts off all the trifles of the office and plays the score of the writer he idolizes. His proper routine imitator, like his grandson, mainly wrote marvelous novels as "Death in Venice" and "The Buddenbrooks". Mann, born in northern Germany, was also the son of an affluent attorney of King Louis I. Known as the "Second Empire of Germany", it was considered the wealthiest and wardest state of the Empire. The citizens of this prosperous state were mostly devoted to commerce and literature. Varnedal rediscovered Mann's first novel, "Happy Whore,"
or wear a copy of this on a trucker as a "silly big girl and her mohawk girl crush FTW" t-shirt (*snerk*) but it's still classic. How did many an english education major come to see the flaws in this jem? I'll tell you. It's a rallying cry. In many a div com paper, this (and many a hastily cut together clip) were put to scold as a personal show creating metaphor because of the drama and spiteful somewhat groupie Jem culture. Fuck you. Just don't take Jem's image and get tattoos based on it. *twitch* That's the whole damn reason it exists, to sell toys to prepubescent boys that their own fathers wanted to buy but thought "Nickelodeon is so much cooler than B-Movies starring Jean Claude Van Damme with bad aspect ratio!"

Yes, it's essentially the same plot, but there are some key differences between Summer Nights with Sandy and Danny and their buddies hanging on campus versus Michael Sachs' 1982 revision, with Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield hanging at the school for the performing arts.

'm now 21 and really wanted to watch it again to see how I felt about it now. I think I viewed it a bit differently but with the same feelings as a teenager. Probably because I am now romantically involved myself, and I actually know what it is like to like somebody, but the complexity of the whole situation (friends, responsibilities, etc.) is what makes the film thought provoking... especially for such a young kid. My advice to any teenager who wants to view this movie, is that once the movie is over, "Stop, Look, and Listen. The glass is half full." This movie, as well as the book itself, will take each viewer/reader on a roller coaster ride through teenagedom. It will make you smile, it will make you cringe, it will make you tense. But in the end you will be okay, because you aren't in love with love, you're in love with Rosie. John Savage really did an outstanding job of reading and interpreting the contents of the book, and that extends to the screenplay as well. He and CJ Omololu did an amazing job! Overall, the film is enchanting and filled with magic, and I hope to watch this movie again in my youth! :o) I give it 5 stars and definitely two thumbs way up! No matter
cast in the same movie does not happen very often.They made the transition to film from acting in theater.I had always heard you shouldn't audition for a movie before the settling on the director, producer, and writer.This is a very cute movie for the whole family. It depicts family issues, a serious spike in the relationship between a mother and daughter, planning on living in AZ but they end up in CA, etc.I watch the ponies for the 99 cent a book specials. How much do you recall each of your ancestors as a person?She has an epilogue, putting the whole family in perspective. Hollis was great, with her joy and major intelligence. .I've gone to conventions for this group.I remember my great great grandmothers, and great grandmother, great aunts and uncles.Some were very hardworking, and others ignored the opportunities people have in America. .I have learned so much about myself through DNA since starting this group.Ancestors of course had much less opportunity to be heard, so it was always fun for people to have this side of my family represented. We were happy any time we could get away from Florida things and go out here. .Way to start, for those at the library, or at pinacle high school who would have a lot of ancestors here, Albuquer
ten which is mathematically not possible. This film starts a little slow but when the fight scene starts, hold your breathe. This is totally believable and very real and I was cheering him on while cringing at the same time. This should be compulsory viewing for parents and those responsible (not those adults who get turned on by child beauty pagaents) who lead a child such a miserable existence. This film is a classic case of child abuse. It is what they call a short film at 15 minutes and it won 5 awards at Cannes 1998 but in my opinion it should win top prize as it is one of the best films I have seen. It has a PG rating but it is so real it come across stronger than that. This film is hard to track down and it may be faster to find the director's name Bruno Dumont and get this and some other of his films which are also worth seeing. I believe that Elephant is a better film, but I am sorry II couldn't see Girlhood. It shows how girls carry guilt in a certain time in their life when often it shouldn't be there at all. There may be a growth of long hair in this film which is often taken to be symbollic but it may not be. It could be a longing to grow which is why people want to get their hair long. At one
the trailer, and I figured history and pacific war is great. So, moments into the Japanese flags, I realize just how dumb this movie is, and what makes it so offensive is that the movie tells you when it’s so dumb! The “For Americans and the Japanese” who “Had no choice but to fight” is more true than the rest of the movie. This movie is a fucking monster, and I’m about to gush some rage porn below. But all I have to really say is that movie illustrates so many problems with this country. Too many to list right now. Like, at what point is it cliche to make white men falls in love with a reflective of self head in a war, etc. Too many racist tropes here that a movie like this make ME consider it Progressive, but it’s actually not. Hollywood, and I sadly mean the same about white people in general, tend to compare things TOO whiteness, objectifying the Orientalizing, etc. In a nutshell, because of the Japanese boy, by Caucasian perspective, the other “savages are summoning the dead, man” is more “pacific” than a brown person or Jew or Asian. The professionalism between two kinds of Pacificensians is not compared to this side or the West. Damn it. I’m sorry
intellectual types, for those who like to sit and think, and put themselves into the shoes of the characters, and work out where things are going. The film depicts an unconventional afterlife, where people live in a world that exists as five minutes in the past and five minutes as the future. They cannot remember any of their lives, whether past or future, and they find it frustrating to move between past and future. The plot is essentially a "What If" story as the lead character struggles to move past her broken life to a point where she can start living again rather than simply existing. When she discovers that she may be pregnant, the course of the story changes significantly. Whether it is sufficient to sustain the film across its 96 minutes, is for the viewer to decide. 6.5/10. Worth tracking down for the unique concept. It reminded me of the Australian TV series DEAD LIKE ME, immensely. Also be prepared for quite dark material, as some people deal with it better than others. As usual I am in the middle when it comes to dark things. :) I certainly did not find this depressing at all, mostly enjoyable. My biggest issue was with the music, but that will be dealt with under "What Did Work or Not Work for You" below. The Last Wave would have worked with no music at all, and I
going into it but now after I've seen it, all I can think is that I adored this movie. It's slow and the camera continuously spins around the actors as they are talking so it's not the most enjoyable movie to watch – I had to fast forward a bit but still I didn't mind it. When I found out that this movie was directed by Spike Jonze my appreciation for it increased since I love him. In the future I just know I will recommend this movie to people every single time almost. I was amazed how perfect all of the actors were and how much I cared for them. I love the chemistry between all of them. The sets looked beautiful and the costumes were everything. I also love that they shot in black and white. This movie has aged perfectly as it was released 20 years ago this year. There's a reason why Chet Betz was awarded the Oscar for Best Costume Design for a Movie. The whole movie looks so glamorous and like one big fairytale – which it probably was. The Actress was most definitely inspired by A Clockwork Orange. Spike Jonze has stated many times that the movie slowly changes into something else by the end and that is something I would've liked to be pointed out to me. I defnitley felt shaken up a little and I think if I had understood that it was a
something but doesnt do anything right to accomplish that. A couple of things bugged me. The whole bio-warfare angle pointlessly killed globalization because it arbitrarily assumed that any nation with such power would choose to kill themselves rather than be controlled by human force. The other thing bugged me is that this type of stuff requires a certain amount of secrecy, but day one is an open invitation for Erin Green who was written to be more of a journalist-skin than a war correspondence.I like the way they moved away from the stupid cliche of the cute journalist getting discovered and placed on the staff, but what happened later is in eclipse. A person would actually not appear suddenly in such a situation adjust only.sometimes guilty as a feature writer, so I find it alien how she was sitting in the circle and having conversations on day one.If the movie would be applied to the perspective of the objective journalist the script would have been changed accordingly. The other brain that does not make sense is the focus on Jason Statham.And it was it threw the final movie out of balance. He treats as a scandalous idiot when he starts his crusade with bio-weapon of genocide. While concealing their origins that violates the Geneva Convention, their sole purpose is to kill everything in his way.While not intentional treats this like a warning and warns immediately by carrying

me , it is the best drama series on tv for a while now. i think he is a brilliant actor, beautiful and so sexy and talented. I would love to say i have the hots for him but doesnt everyone has a hot for him including women.am sick to death of murders , death and crime dramas but since i watched manchee best friend whoimg he played in this tp a while ago has completly changed to Sawyer.good looking,handsome,beauiful face, lovely hair that can be in a ponytail and also flowing down your neck, all the women in the office at work have as poster of him with a gorgeous smile and his big brown eyes only until Daniel Faraday, Des, Jack,LJ and Kate arrive to help them back to the present from 1977.Only to find out that he is different then what he was 16yrs ago and to his surprise he FAAAAAANNNN CORMOYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!. i personally like SIUYNDEYYYYY who i believe has played the one to go onto another series after leaving lost. i personally think this is a perfect ending for him to move onto s another series. i cant wait to watch the final even though i dont think the cast and crew wantthe series to end as they have been part of it for so many
it's deplorable, it's laughable and it nearly made me weep. Because its typical Jason deemed a film class triumph thanks to 'nitpicking' and analysis. Which also includes obscure films you've never heard of. So everybody digs out entirely personal opinions from the crystal balls of their skull cavities and they apply it to the film in all it's unwatchable glory. The same as the extra's on the 'Chuckie series' for instance. This film is absolutely utterly no where near the awesomeness, or recommended viewing status that the media want us to believe. You have ADD, shouldn't I have fuck you in the head? Absolutely. Camp Blood is a federal offense, with some offensive dialogue, and a large amount of stupidity. It's more like a comedy, in the fact I was giggling whenever Jason was on screen (caricaturing the new Tom Savini mask BTW) It's like an afterschool special of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Pinehurst is good for KIDS, Cut Hard Forest is bad. OH, HO, HO, I've got it! As for the characters of Camp Blood, they all look like they could have been ripped from your average school class in your average school in Ohio in 1967. Their all one dimensional characters
a little scary) for those of us with a slightly warped sense of humor. Although Depp continues to take on some pretty off-the-wall characters, this is humor for those who like their laughs "scrappy, silly, wacked out, and extreme" (copyright -- The Other Paper). As twisted as it appears, "War, Inc." is really more about Caspian's struggle for the American Dream --doesn't matter that he's employing the tools of a dictator for the purpose. Almost an elitist version of self invented survivalism in the face of an overwhelming cocktail of evils. Instead of George Bush, he blames the lifelong power (read wealth) behind things. A sense of Mockingbird, Godfather and?...maybe Apocalypse Now? The Blackwater goons are too much to hope. Think Star Wars with half the gore and an even more unlikely hero. It as absurdist satire: dark, cynical, and almost poetic in its detail. It's big: multinational poetry slash a non stop car chase. It's real (as opposed to filet Oscar). It's ridiculous (perhaps an upper) and devilishly entertaining! . Think Adam Sandler humor derived from a horrific Mayberry R.F.
days ago - annoyed at the story line and yet riddled with curiousity as to what happens next. Where the fans and the family of the show got it all wrong IMHO is the question as to how long Judith could wait to file for divorce, in absence of extramarital activities. Other than that, the show saved the best for last. The final scene of a dying couple asleep on their living room couch is the most bittersweet, beautiful way to end the show. Trust Mark R in taking the scene from him, the character that "Everybody loves." In reality he is "Just Jerry" with one Academy award and two Emmy awards to his credit which I certainly felt was worth respecting in no small part to his talent and whose character we grew to love throughout 9 seasons of the show. He learned in real life that it doesn't matter who you are in this world, no matter your successes, wealth, talent, looks or anything else, but rather it's who people have in their lives, friends and family for support...even if that means a longe-haired wannabe real-life widow. Even if there was no real romance, I'm glad that we, the viewers, got to believe there was. After all, that is all we really have to sustain interest in our own lives. A story is only what we tell ourselves and make it to be
poop dry'. Tessa flaunts her sexual prowess to oblivion with effects that would head to the 'graphics bin' of 90s tv rendering obsolete, the only (slightly)... More mysterious element here is a revolving door involving suited up- guys like some kind of live-action rendition of a renga kyuu abecedarian, or alphabet soup 'world's most lmelock' if you want to get brutal with an ecdysteroid.

Is Anne Bennett better or just more charming? Both? Perhaps channelling almost fifty years of the overpraised John Gielgud collecting lines like beads on a string it comes more naturally for her. But Michael Hordern might be considered more theatrical, and Louis Hayward exotic, eyeing Caroline in autre temps and modes. His own romantic, and her embarrassed recollection of the past cast something of eternity to the charade. And there is of course, the intrusive age, time, place fascination: Hart’s daughter is in love with her stepfather’s father, well – Hercule Poirot used to pop up like the bunny of sporting fiction in The Most Fascinating Girl of all. What if the suspense had been in briefly not knowing One Body, which was forgotten by a minor male strong enough to cast fogyish eyes into the past. The body to be found in the secret gardening doublet with Caroline Crale’s corpse would have been more thrilling: Kilman Dale, the redoubtable STOMP. The only deficiency might have been momentary motivation, but that is no frustration: they talk in their manners and wits, then it’s off. There’s something of Richard Brendan huge but elegant to the Hordern and no awe that would
quality since lost (which i absoloutely loved). i have often heard people say 'this is the one to watch'. that certainly is the case with this show. i'm on to season 2 and already hooked. did you attempt to record all of season 1 on a dvd? i'm trying to but currently only have the last 4 episodes. the only customary thing is the fact that i keep getting the 'mpeg 2 program stream wants data buffering' error. i have the 4.2.1 odm 2.5.0 version (kt 15b017) and the latest kodibcl (1.8.0.0) hoping this firmware update fixes it. yes, it's on my appeworld site (excellent for the rare and unique show) plus season 3. definitly a show well worth watching. personally the trailer alone hooked me. xbox matters having great quality in hardware deserves it great quality entertainment as well. looking forward to the next season. thanks deadanime for the recommendation also. feeling good about this season (it's already shaping up to be a good post season 3 quality one) been re watching season 1 likea madman in preparation for foxtel next wednesday (17th). gonna be a good quality bloodletting as foxtel pre-empts
and the end of the movie, I really enjoyed it. However, it left me with some questions. I'm still no wiser as to what was happening in this movie except that the pretious stones were taken over to Europe when the Nazis won both World War I and World War II. Where did they get the stones? How did they get them? The movie I believe was fairly overblown in size and scope. Two of the actors in the movie Rutger Hauer and Roy Scheider died in 2019. The only thing I can say about The Sea Wolves movie is that great movie actors lent it their talent of acting, which it needed, The movie had nice scenery and outdoor views. However, I felt that the movie's plot was as narrow or tight as the tracks of an American standard gauge railroad. The movie's main characters go on a cargo train that was in poor shape and possibly had the give and take of a freight train. Other than that, it was steam locomotive operated. This movie, however, does have a theme around; it really is not a movie crammed full of actions. Suppose seeing a movie raging with action is a pastime for you, this is not the movie you should watch and better go watch a similar movie based on historical fiction. (The Di Vinci Code, for example.) This navy wild rice Feast movie is not. The

top favorite Asian flicks of all time. Simply said and classified, Twins Effect is a spin-off of the Stephen Chow classic, The God Of Cookery. The film splits the story into 3rd person perspectives and showcases how different people deal with and react to the charismatic character of the great Maggie Cheung (Claudia Lee), fused with the film's retro sci-fi vibe and over the top gunfire and sword action, well choreographed fight scenes. Mainly targeting Hong Kong's female fan base, however, it is also one of those films that has many great elements combined into one, is watchable over and over, never loosing its grip and has its own uniqueness. Greatest Lines: "Now that I think of it, I agree with you! We have nothing to worry about. The god of cookery seems to be on our side. The best thing you can do with this experience is simply enjoy it", "I would not just let you go! See those divots on the side of your face? Let me show you how they were made. Your nose is really good for things like this", "Enough! These pills are called Quik-Draw. They contain powerful sperm from our household that will make even the weakest man brave. Here, take these." I've seen this one at least 30
drama, and a subtle love story. It fits the Coen brothers required genre change, a period film set in Europe for the most part. I would have no problem watching it again and again. This is how you can have a period film I can relate to. Well, last century I should have said but you will get my point. 8* outta 10* A very good film that will appeal to most tastes. Check it out, you won't be sorry. Oh yeah, two writers and two directors. How many people said that could never happen again? Maybe Two Fitzes* would be good. *Dick & Fitz* Heinlein sat down and wrote a screenplay and insisted that they direct it. Throw it to the Coens' for a once over paint job and have fun. Or maybe Clint. 'Never get out of the boat' Eastwood. How about that? Maybe it is time for relegating their jobs to the ranks once again.

though they were really scary. But one thing they always did, was turn the lights off in the living room so reporters and aliens couldn’t spy on us through the window ;-). Most of the movies were American and people hardly ever thought about Japan… That’s why it took me so long before I came to realise that the scariest horror movies are Japanese! But it has happened and I’d love to drag as many of you as possible to a cinema trip to see ‘A flute of our World’. So come on, press play. It’s about time to watch the scariest horror movie ever! A flute of our World is a silent (voice-less) black and white Japanese movie, which is a part of a horror trilogy. It has an Academy Award nomination and was venerated in the 50’s in Cannes, nevertheless its artistic producer was attacked. Sounds like a modern horror story, but it is true and it all starts with… Japanese milk bottles. I Wanna Live Daily Fresh Japanese Milk! Japanese people have been drinking milk daily fresh, but delivery of milk products has never been so much of an issue. In 1903, two Americans named E.S. Williams And J.P. Dear Dewey had founded the United Co of Milk Suppliers (Japan) which was
it for more than two hours just for the sake of finishing it out. I haven't been this bored for some time. My oh my was White Zombie directed by Victor Halperin a breath of fresh air. This is a great piece of cinematography. A lot of attention was put into this film for its time and it holds up really well as the crashes. White Zombie is a potent thriller, with many aptly placed comische moments, that helps to make this horror film very watchable. Madge Bellamy does a fair job in the lead role and gives us that seriousness with a little twinkle in her eyes that exceeds all reason. Bela Lugosi is his usual great self. “Oh my dear gentlemen men.” There is some issues thankfully only minor issues in this film with the boom mic slamming into a pillar or two, the facial close ups of Lugosi looking a little bit too much like pictures you see on the local news after some avalanche, and the receptionist having to slam the door a bit before one more line as if we’re not going to get the joke. But credit is due to Halperin for including in this film some of the more bizarre imagery that has ever graced a pre-code film. A scene where Lugosi slides up the side of the tower he’s locked up in,
in this disjointed comedic mess of aborted comedy. The only thing that keeps you from leaving the theater is that you don't want to pay the 10 dollars to see the movie again. I would have helped you (editor) improve this monogram if that was possible. The script is lousy, obviously tried to be a dramatic comedy, but the language and content are more grim and macabre. Jonah Hill, desperate to obtain an Oscar outplayed Jim Carrey as titled character. Less is always more on film. My apolloges for my bad review. Part of me hopes one day this film goes missing. Except it didn't. Unfortunately it has made nearly 400 million dollars. What a shame. Your script, "Killer Bullets" was a far better read than the travesty the world got in 2013... Warwick B. Hill. star of such classics as "Bum Boy Bound" & "Red Storm Justice" ....aka... US marshal meet bad boy... great stuff! Mr. Hill, I would be honored if you could put a bit more effort into your reviews. I think you forgot to turn this sucker into theaters....CAPAOPEEWA? Ha! Meanwhile it has made a nearly 400 million dollars worldwide, It was abismal, or course. I mean, I
big anthology. Even more desperate was the fact that I, Troama, shot all of this footage on a damn potato camera so expect a lot of warped colors and images that seem to be on a oil painting background... if that makes any sense. But it's not all bad since I know how much you all love bright pink, so in a sense I proved the superiority of my cameras colour settings so in the end this is a win for me. Enjoy the movies, to the best of your ability-which may just be staring dumbstruck at the screen. Other then that I hope you dig. Shot in 2004. This movie is from the first DVD release, which had five chapters. I broke this up into the following trainees: 1.) Mia Rouge- Born to be in Pink pt 1 2.) Mia Rouge- Born to be in Pink pt 2 3.) Blue Blazers 4.) Mary Jane-Buff Leather and Brogues 5.) At the Pits. The truth behind this video is that Troama had a couple of very bad movies that was taped on the same day as this video. So due to his impatience with his editing system he dumped all the movies into one and labeled it "Whipped Ass Girls Illustrious Accompl
eccentricities. Instead of cutting her off they did the opposite. This tells me that DESPITE Jo's claims that it's all about GINA it isn't--it's ALL about Gina. Somewhere along the line Jo decided that after 4 children and 26 years of marriage she'd had it. I also liked CAT hersel and found her a real class act. It's so true that CAT needs her to take care of her and take a real part in her care. I liked that Gina gets clothing and food stamps which so many qualified for don't get. I also felt that WAKEFIELD was really the person who messed up that marriage more than BELLINI. I think they needed to protect Joe more. Jessica Lange is one of the best actresses around and this was a great vehicle of HEALING for her after Sandy on Grey's Anatomy last year. Next up: Children of Men! Also got a great drone video of the NYC skyline, Mr. NYPD, shows us how it's done as he spies on us spotting a soul on the Williamsburg Bridge. (Loved the JAZZ music for that one).

with Tom Hanks' charm (wonderful, as usual). It's an updated story of Pygmalon turning into a beautiful woman to real look (Joe Normal coming out of the box). I wanted to see it again the morning after viewing it. I won't tell the story as it is discussed enough. The Tower of Babel story, by contrast, needs to be re-examined because the tale is told over and over without questioning the elements involved. But I'll discuss it only in generalities since I'm guided by Natasha's simple, direct questions. Time scale. What happened then and how long - source? Memory of human kind, world, don't know exactly how long. Want to diagram the framing, pattern the babel narrative, thought it was something like 3,000 years then 1,000 years earlier - something like that, will have to look it up. I keep thinking and thinking of the terrible, uncontrollable flood story, the flooded world wiping out all civilization except for drift boats and the ensuing eventual building of Babylon. NASA as reference against other interpretations will be valuable. E-mail me if you reach any conclusions about the time frames involved. I find the original story intriguing and in comparison to the movie, you realize how concise and quick is the
honestly think that Andrea Occhipinti really gave an amazing performance too. The barely visible and hand-held camera helped a lot to make the Vuci seemingly surreal co-production a frustrating and enduring italian masterpiece. Bravo! Up the kids! And yes, Kindness Done in Return by the Dead End Kids in the very first minute of the movie gives you a claw to hold to the best of the best that the italians can do. Bravo again and again and again! Semper idem in aeternum!

This video is obviously a work of art.… MoreI could keep on and on but it will be as u say ;prob more talk yet.

I concede there are worse things in the World, but after I started watching it, I could've run outside and got run over by a bus and it wouldn't have made me feel worse about it. I came close to turning it off several times, but I thought maybe it would get better. Nope. Not only does the bashing of the deceased continue, but the character also goes after friends, family, and even his daughter. The only thing that really helped was knowing it was going to be taken out of stock and will probably be removed from Amazon forever, so I doubt I'll have to sit through it anytime soon. But if you know someone who likes Tim Franco Kearny and you're looking for a bad idea of a gift, this'll do the trick. Enjoy!!!!!!! --------------------- After Tim's break with the Kearny gang, a couple of thugs try to kill him, resulting in his daughter being kidnapped and brainwashed. Now he must break into a high security prison in New York for a final climatic showdown. During his quest, many members of the Kelley gang meet bizarre deaths. . Here you will see members of the Kelley gang being ripped to shreds by one of the character's . . dogs. You will also be treated to scenes of a large rock being dropped "Sopranos" style
StJohn Domirell, a retired English brigadier general, had taken the place of the late Herbert Ringwood, the assistant to the greatest British runner Bob Beckford. The whole plot is based on misconception what task the general is supposed to take in his hand. His Lady played by a wild Maggie Smith, bets him, that he couldn't do it, in bet was a sum of l0,000 pound. St John was told in a letter what must he do. He must be a runner on 79th annual Winston Cup as an alter ego Bob Beckford. Racing at that time with a 390 Hemi V-8, a very fast, sophisticated model Plymouth Fury Sport Sedan. Bob had an accident his eighth victory in Bristol in England. Bob was serious injured so he couldn't cope now with next races. Diametrically the opposite as a senior St John thinking about taking in that race his yellow Mercedes as a seven race champion. Ruth could not interfere in St John's mind for his decision but she won bet. She had his horse whisperer race her Jeepney, a very fast little prototype race car. St John loved pony racing so he became a winner in the race bobbling of his Jeepney with the mule as he offered his old horses. In the nick of time beside fra

It bombed at the box office but I had the soundtrack to “The Titanic”; in other words I had pirated music from a film that fell on it’s arse at the cinema. Maybe thats why it never got a cinema listing in Ireland & I only ever got to see it late one night, during my trip to Limerick. I digress. There is some comedy logic to it all, however much of the plot seems weak, & the effects are poor by today’s standards.

Is it a nation at war, with less than honourable men atop a pyramid of knowledge, or is it fun & games? Its fun & games. Only witness the arm wrestling between Macleane & Plunkett, the
to looking at the wiki page for Japanese horror films to see if anything interesting jumped out as something I may not have seen...and there it was. Cool Boys, the 1988 film about a high school girl whose crush on is possessed by a vengeful warrior spirit (or seppuku spirit)...hmm, that doesn't sound boring at all. Told you I've seen every other movie. Here we find ourselves at the beginning of a spooky tale from Japan that's meant to frighten us with the visuals...and how's this for irony: I ended up fearing for my own life. Shocking, and I feel it's worth it when I get to the end of this. I had to look it up because there was no English description of the film, but ginji youkai translates to silver (gin, e.g. Sailor Moon's hair was silver) hair kamo youkai (shape shifting spirit). So I guess it's safe to say this Kamuo dude could change his form at will for whatever reason. Regardless to the translation of his name, the fact still currently remains that I know absolutely nothing about how silver-haired demon-kun came to possess the body of our protagonist or anything at all besides she knows his name (Kamuo) and for he did
alone. At one point, I looked at the clock and it was 1:15 a.m. When my phone rang, the clock read 8:31 a.m. I had lost nearly 7 hours of time while watching this movie. I’ve only lost that much time while studying for finals the last few years. This movie surprised me and I didn’t see the ending coming, and for that, I loved it. I also have always thought David Lynched to be incredibly talented. He has a unique way of creating the deepest surreality and inconsistencies with a very realistic morpheus. He makes your mind truly question it’s limits and his work is already legendary. I also love the soundtrack, as I think that many filmmakers fail to choose a good pairing between music and visuals. Needless to say, Mulholland Drive is an outstandingly interesting film that brings together tales of innocence, confusion and dreams. I’m so glad I had the additional time to experience it all. Maybe I’ll have time to write a review for Star Maps also. Haha. Watch it. If you’ve seen it, please tell your friends. Out of all of his visions, this is my favorite. Have a favorite of his? Tell me why! I’d love to know. ♥ STAY CLASSY! ♥
it was unbelievable that she did not need to brush her teeth or go to the bathroom for that entire span of time; and secondly, and more so, I love Elizabeth Taylor. She was the only reason, or excuse, I ever got to sit through this movie in its entirety and without being sent to my room to study, because I, at the tender age of twelve years old, fell in love with ‘the violet eyes’. Two years later I saw Cleopatra and even though she was incredibly unmemorable in that movie, the violet eyes still drew me in no matter what she was doing. The violet eyes, the sultry voice, Elizabeth Taylor was always a scene stealer no matter what the movie said about her star calibre E!T!Was all in all, a gorgeous movie brunette with the striking characteristic that made her look every inch a movie star, those amazingly unnatural violet eyes. She may have been an advocate herself of some of the artificial ishmael again, retreating of the iris from devotion to an ocean impurity like the rest of those who lay back against the wall and die; but were so, we hardly know it. Do we believe Herman Melville about this scene, or even Paul Metcalf about it? Did Benito Cereno really cause such an i kill others do the same
I did not see the 2006 version of The Wicker Man as I liked the original so much. But when my friend asked me to create a review for The Wicker Man (2006) I knew I had to watch it, as I felt the pressure, like I always do when I see something that I love, this one with the pair of dice in my hands and my eyes on the die sliding on the table, probably that face that my friend and Filipino poker fans usually see is not too pretty, but I couldn't resist hehe. They say I can be very childish at times, already another challenge in The Wicker Man (2006) movie, so here it is what you have all been waiting for the review of The Wicker Man (2006) by me. Just as if a could be Milenio Express done this but you get the picture. Ok, so it is done, so what is this movie all about. Not going to fill you in, you can watch it if you want, but I actually liked this movie, way more suspenseful than the original, possibly because the ending is more unsharp, I was waiting for the original ending, which had, as I am sure you all know the green buddhist nun bursting into the burning ritual and killing cops and stuff, or can anyone have a copy of that part through there? I know
in the FSLC guide that Kyle quoted: "Counted among the many Italian film movements, the so-called Neorealist school. . . . Established in 1943, with the completion of Bellissimo by Luchino Visconti." You'd be surprised at the curiously faithful crowd in the balcony up there for that one. Maggie Cheung's Italian soul twists and turns. Laura has a scene-stealing, zingier role than she's ever gotten in New York. And you know that smells of blood thing Kyle's act two, long post about German Gothic was constantlv alluding to? Where the tormented heroes are always smelling of corpses and rotting fruit and shit? He's talking about this movie. Seriously. Ring a bell, Kyle? Smells Like Wine? Visconti's one of the great directors of the century--and maybe a genuine psychopath. He was later described by Derek Jarman as a "paranoid megalomaniac who would force cast and crew to wait around for hours on finish until he decided all was perfect." That's actually a really funny quote, and it's probably pretty apt. Still, Derek Jarman isn't anywhere near as fun as Kim Morgan. As part of the magazine's attempt
. Though classified as a werewolf movie there is virtually no footage of the beast itself. The main attack occurs in a hotel room where a werewolf inexplicably emerges from a cupboard after eating a housekeeper; the rest of the despatches are off-screen. The creature is depicted by shadows, paw prints and a couple of news reports when the kit is back to normal. Through all this the beast is killed by the end, how I know not. That said it is a competently put together entry into the Universal Horror cycle made in the fifties as B movies to entertain an early morning audience. Where it excels however is in the penultimate scene as the beast lures a young secretary and her aged employer to the river’s edge to finalise the score. It is here that the feral predator switches from human prey and takes a canine line twice across the water to ensure he has dispatched both fishy folk. Like all other werewolves at the period it was shot, the young secretary is fed to the old man as a delicious savoury before the dog swims to the edge of the lake hunting for more. The kill is little more than a poodle munching on a sheep’s tongue but that may be why it is often cut from the sequence when it goes to air today. There is
ever seen. It's like a bigger, better, more dramatic war-themed version of Batman Begins. Chris Pine does a great job playing a rebellious leader, and Eric Bana is pretty alright as a likable sergeant. Other big names include Ben Foster and Keira Knightley. It's a lengthy but great film. Definitely worth seeing if you're a wartime/historical movie fan. Might not hit you as hard if you hate war films, though. But overall, this is my new Scarface. Complete and utter amazingness! Great gritty detail, great camera work, amazing soundtrack... I'll be recommending this movie to people for a lifetime.

the story of Howard Keel (a young farmer in rum country), who is always being pushed around by his dad, and taken for granted by his two love interests (Jean Hagen and Kathryn Grayson). Winning singing by both (especially in "Make Believe" and the title song) and in a couple of numbers featuring chorus girls in skimpy bathing suits. When it is discovered that Greyson's gambler husband has won almost all his savings, Howard is willing to forgive all, and marry her. But there is to be a flip-flop as the situation becomes untenable within two weeks, when her husband's shipments are overdue, and they all "go up the river". Then there is the famous extended dance scene, using the cantilevered rear suspension of a stationary bus. "Dig Dig Dig for the Dexedrine", a musical take on a Mitch Miller sing-along, works its way in the opening part of the chase, which involves train yards, an airplane hanger, and is one of the most humorous (and dangerous) scenes in movies. They literally dance and sing the song in zero gravity, next to a lot of roaring jet planes sitting wing tip to wing tip. The scene reduces audience members to HYSTERICS as the stampede exits the theatre. And in an interesting
the search to the rise and development of the Nazi party to the Nuremberg trials. In my interest in German history, this was very interesting. But what made me sit on the edge of the sofa was a documentary made by the German NGO 'Quero Ihr' (voluntarily, I think) in France. This French NGO had joined forces with gypsies and had been filmed in training nazi-deathcamp guards. These were male and female guards, and their method of training involved trying to force the men to kill women and the women to kill babies. This documentary bears witness for the first time to such testimonies. The picture below shows the documentation from Quero Ihr. This fall their website will be online again, I hope. The second image below made me cry, although everything I know about Gypsies, stemming from Argentina's heritage. But Tibat's internal landscape echoed. I made and borrowed Gypsies into my life. And when I knew Kjell suddenly changing sides, going white and not black and honestly asking what it was all about, but especially what Gypsies had to do with anything, I was speechless. Somewhere I didn't have to explain anything to anyone, and in that moment I then was looking at the eyes on the face of a Gypsy playing the violin right next to

ideology and blah blah blah....but because its a fucking Filipino movie made by inexperienced full bugs with the mentality of teenagers,it ends up becoming a pathetic love story with some black women and it turns out to be one big shaking ass titty story which the director has some hidden homosexual fantasy about.A quite rare "horror" presentation but in all truth the director started off bad and keeps on getting worse. Phewwweeee.....what to think,what to think.........since Its Sarahel who is dead and now in tunai,don't you think she's the burned city? Basically this feature is just an attempt by some hip sassy kids that bought a camcorder (through which the film is shot with). The only one whom I can respect is their teacher who gets paralised through the movie but is the only one who gets his act together, calls the others stupid asses and returns. We are in a universe "scared" of these guys --as the actors are scared of AT LEAST something that's monstrous and anything that I could put a label on some of you may recognise as being "spiritual". Fact is that these kids have no idea about MYSTICISM to me (bringing to mind all that I said about The Forest for instance). Its just a bunch of stupid
of the films I went to see at the movie houses in KL over the New Year, mostly due to 1. It's a totally different approach for DiCaprio, who aces the depiction of a person otherwise so unlike Jack da Ripper and a much less entertaining one in Titanic 2.0, which I watched the year before this one. 2. It has capability for great actors, but so many of the actors underwhelmed me in the last few Hollywood remakes that they've done that I wanted to see how they pull of the less famous ones. What a great cast! The actor who played Patton played that role so well that I could respect it more and not wait for his turn to die in Watchmen the following year. I essentially had a lot of respect for that movie, while Provance stands today in my top ten of fun films. Great genre systems, great gore, great nostalgia, great fights (some great killers!), and OK special effects (I thought they were good, but it was 8 years ago now). Looking at it again on DVD this evening (cheap copy from a convenient shop at the mall), I was genuinely impressed. Art-house acting was well embedded, and even though it ended in relatively predictable fashion (in fact, I predicted it!), it came full circle with a nice flow. The industry-standard explos
become a delicious froth given dashes of humor. Nearly everything about Don't Bother to Knock is fraught with potential danger. Marie Windsor plays her part to perfection. The glib and devilish Richard Widmark has never done anything half as good. This is an oddball gem. Each actor makes you lean in to his or her performance and become one of those people in the darkened auditorium who whisper to their neighbor, "Have I told you how glad I am to be seeing this movie with you?" You want to ask, "Did you know it was going to be like this?" Yet you already knew; didn't you? There isn't a real character in the film. The dialogue is never quite real, sneering with an edge of poison but saying reassuring, cheery, or simply ironic things with a kind astonishment that this could be happening in such a strange way. "Do you always have to have a bed all to yourself when you go away for the weekend?" Widmark asks Windsor by way of introducing her to Walters, who automatically blushes. Attentive viewers will start up the spoiler machine long before they should. But why should they? It's not like any of us knew anything about the way an airplane ticket system operates in the 1950s, or who worked in an air
film from present-day filmmaker Mads Matthesen. “Boy Meets Girl” is a sequel to Matthesen’s earlier short films, “She” and “He”. He describes this film as a screwball comedy about two despicable people who need each other like a drug. She is a devious, manipulative ten-year-old girl. What? You have a double standard and want to cry? Or are your sensibilities overly offended when it comes to anyone besmirching a girl's innocence? Well put that out of your mind, not to mention that your stone-cold heart, and instead focus on his character, Greta. For Albert is a blubbery, middle-aged loser in the female employment pool: a fusty door-to-door fuller of hot, sexual fantasies, surrounded by cartons of stinking waste, and who cleans his clothes in the toilet bowl. Can two so dissimilar, so mutually unattractive beings be a good match for each other? That, according to Matthesen, is the big question, and if “asked and given,” the answer is definitely, yes! Can you take it? I loved it!! This quick-paced, kinky little movie is probably not rated, so don’t take your little girl along, and trigger me if you
, the collaboration of Noel Coward and Sheridan Le Fanu, and features Ian Hendry at his absolute best. Daughters of Darkness, it certainly was not! Yet much of the time I was glad lawyers hadn’t the guts of a whelk and it hadn’t made it to a cinema near you. Please, dear reader, don’t go looking for it on tv: you’ll be amazed at how boring it is. And it could have been so much better! But let me put this in perspective. The 1978 adaptation of Le Fanu’s Carmilla was a Broadway play at the end of the 19th century and made into a silent in 1915. Both that play and the film versions achieved the full level of hysterical camp by concentrating on the scandalous, overwrought, maudlin plot with little attention paid to the nuances of the dialogue and no attempt whatsoever to present any real sense of atmosphere. The 2000 made for television version starring Natascha McElhone as Carmilla and Julia McKenzie as Laura goes quite a a different, outright weird way in its meticulously period disconcertingly Gothic atmosphere and some very odd, psychologically distant direction. In some ways, the 1978 version had the right idea. S
Judy Morris and the late Russell Drysdale. The main female actress (forgotten her name since it's been so long) has made a very good living too out of film and tv on the East coast. A real delight. In total contrast there is the very sad romance "Shame" starring Barry Humphries (Dame Edna) & Bryan Brown, shot in W.A. Has to be one of the saddest movies it has ever been my misfortunate to watch. Another detail is, both actors continue to live in Perth. Is anyone else familiar with those two movies and have any thoughts or comments to add. barbara cuthbertson.

Now, to the survey... ----------------- Track listings: ----------------- Lots of songs! This is a soundtrack the GROUP wrote and made for the actual movie! It also features 5 days and 5 nights and 3 lesser known songs! --------------------- 6 years ago Lily had some friends over for the night, and they were a pretty tame crowd. They stayed up as long as 3:00 AM that night, and as soon as they left Lily had decided that she wanted to piss off her parents by stealing their vhs player, their cable box, and quite a few horror tapes. Of course she couldn't ask them to steal without their parents knowing, so she went through the grapevine to pick out who she would intrust. Slowly Lily was given several different keys to her home, and she took everything out of her parents cabinet. She took those out at 1 in the afternoon. 6 Years Ago Lily was up late at night reorganizing her video tapes. She took everything out her tapes and put them into alphabetical order. After that she
the Messiah more simply than the actual music-making of four talented musicians. The idea almost sounds laughable, as it has been the attempt of numerous films in the past of the great quartet. When Earlimart's leader, Aaron Espinoza, expressed his interest in a story about a magical road trip with his lighthouse friend Arik Roper doing the poster and effects, things got great when yet not everybody got involved immediately. In the Danger Damage Done, there are not four actors, particularly as the Beatles seemed far removed from the darkened enclosed rooms that the demand of most movies requires. So the movie was on. And the subsequent documentary of the movie's own trajectory toward the air shows the participation of numerous contributions. Along with the making of the band's appearance on the Rolling Stones Rock'N'Roll Circus television show in 1968, the story is told through interviews with Jim Dine, Keith Richards, Roger Sargent, John Haag, Johnny Jay, and Brent Flowers. It is indeed a narrative about the build-up to that moment and the subsequent relationships between the artists involved. As poet/painter David Lynch spoke to writer/director Jonathan Caouette, the story moves toward Caouette's own magical trek of real-life. So as Dine takes the director out
went into production. To start things off, with David Mamet attached as co-writer, it was originally going to be a completely comedy. It even had a title, which has nothing to do with the fil…O.K., the title does work somewhat with what ended up on the screen eventually. Regardless, the purpose was to comment on modern America’s politics, which is a goal that plenty of others have stated they are doing in the past, except with this one superbly skilled cynical writer and director at the helm. So it never came about. As footage was reportedly shot, Tommy Lee Jones left the project, then Chris Cooper, then Julie Christie, all with different reasons given. Go figure. It is worth repeating that this is exactly what Mamet wanted to accomplish, and why he chose Sayles out of all the prominent American filmmakers to trust for this? Why does this seem to be in question when it should be regarded similarly to Basquiat or something by Tennessee Williams? My proof is the ending. So, assuming someone would choose the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, mainly based on Dahmer-esque self-proclaimed curiosity, it is officially decided to visit Quinwood, Iowa, since like many other cities in our modern America, progress is a negative word.

- 16 year old us, if you have ever installed links between the underground punk scenes across the world, then this movie will take you there. Another nice documentary from the maker of this movie, is The Gits movie. Then we follow four punks Backstreet (Bryan Herع office), Romeo, Mercy (Bobcat). A movie sponsored by the American Social Security Administration for recruiting young people with the system, but instead the recruitment has to strengthening the gangs among the young people in the metropolis. The focus is also on a group of nuns who have a street outreach, the Sisters of bon Secour. A gripping and attractive tale from soldiers punks on the street, with different emphasis on TEs & GAYS culture. The story reflects how rôpen the gays on punk scene in the 1980? Check out the interview Matt Zac, one of the artists ejected out of the scenes. An interview with the car in place. For parents-you can start to lose heta but I won? The movie in todoing: an origin, falling in the void is taught, struggling with AIDS, which is dismissive and de-grite from a wife and children. The story is sad and tragic. Perhaps the most sad and moving tale from the documentaries of the DVD Great Big BBC Collection could
see what changes they made were not going to ruin the greatness of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings but I can also see that they did it just for action. For example when Gandalf acts creepy to help them escape, or when Strider tells the ones wish is to tie him up to guide them or even the end when they choose to go with Gandalf, instead of Aragorn, Boromir, and Legolas telling the others that Sam will never make it through Mordor. Anyways, great movie, go see it. I just recommend that you try to block out Peter Jackson's alterations. You would be doing yourself as well as the faithful Tolkien fans around the world a huge favor. Oh, by the way, I've not read the new volumes out yet but I might invest in them, and hopefully they will be better. I also recommend the movies, but barely after I read the books. Anyways, now go on with your day. BUY THE BOOKS the movies are just obsessed fans relatively speaking.

Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing's Boogie Man (1999). In all other respects it takes ideas from Asghar Farhadi's Sekkil (About Elly, 2009) and Academy Award winner Loach's Nasty Habits. Spooky Woman is a smelly stinkpot of a film. Made on a budget of only Rs. 20 lakhs, director Chase’s third feature is a paranormal wannabe that fails to conjure up any horror. A botched attempt along the supernatural line, Spooky Woman could fall apart at any moment. If the plot wasn’t already scattered all over the place, it was the sloppy camerawork that patched the cracks. While actress Sandhya Sathe steals the show with a splendid performance as Seva Janardhan Kale, her family isn’t short of a few freaks too. Daughter Vidhya Kale stays awake talking to a dead brother. Son Sastry Kale, a fishing vessel captain, lost most of the members of his crew when he was at sea. Wife Diksha Kale seems angsty. And worse, Sastry and Diksha meddle with the belief system of Seva, thereby disrupting her life; not to mention their son’s secret girlfriend. And
really all Affleck's fault (and significant parts are not his fault at all). Anything tracing itself back to the abomination that is Daredevil is doomed by its very nature, even if Superman returns to its roots as an ongoing series after this disaster. The lack of chemistry between Affleck and The Norwegian Girl (google it, it couldn't be any less helpful) are definitely both Affleck's fault, though, and particularly since I really liked him in The Accountant, I cannot in good conscience joke about that leg. His calves can basically do whatever they want; I don't have a problem with that. It wasn't even really his fault that the screenplay is so clunky - that started back with Daredevil creator Frank Miller, who seems to have really put all of his passion into the photoshopping of Batman and Robin (the ones with Robin and Bats in costume) to support his claim that the movie is an intentional parody of historic bad comic adaptation sequels. A good book about his life talks about how even Miller felt that the editing of that movie was too literary, that it didn't give enough to the fans of the characters to cater to them. Yeah, he can't be punished too much for this, but this movie is a train-wreck from the beginning. No,
, given the fact that much of the style of their work was later mimicked and adapted for several Mad Monty Python sketches, I had expected them to be WAY funnier than they actually were. They mostly followed a straight mimicry/parody formula...e.g., Monty Python & The Holy Grail's famous-because-it's-endless-referenced "brave Sir Robin" song based on "relly Mr. Huxtable" single takes on "Brave Sir Robin." The Crazy Gang's big hit "The Hokey Kokey was essentially just that--a single-note joke, hilarious...once. The Hokey Cokey routines given to the Pythons (each Pythonting the dance to a different instrument) is imitative anyway--they took the idea and ran with it. I laughed during that scene of The Holy Grail. Enjoy the pop-culture spoofing, even the background manifold references (adroitly edited in here) still manage to be clever. But IMDb failed to credited (quote) "the chorus of singing monks" petitioning for permission to sing "The Hokey Cokey" before Caesar has them killed (nice bit of foreshadowing humor, if you'll recall their song at the end: "See it's his birthday--can we kill him?
coming and they get more and more ostentatous and the desperation is palpable. Ive seen three of them this year: Bill Murray, Jim Carrey and Patrick Stewart’s versions. Jim Carrey’s version deserves an honorary Razzie. How do you put so many brownie points into one performance? I actually wish Jim Carrey had done a song and dance number. Its so ludicrously over the top and all the wonder and joy of the story has been beaten out of it. What is redeeming to me is that its’ Jim Carrey so I like the rest of it anyway. That dude doesn’t do bad. A lot of water has passed under the bridge from the classics, “Miracle on 34th Street” and “It’s a Wonderful Life” so it’s time to throw in the Christmas movie towel. I unabashedly loved the one with Richard Attenborough with hilarious and brilliant supporting players Mara ctivate and Elizabeth Perkins. The color in that is sublime. So for future generations, watch it to find out what the original version of “A Christmas Carol” was like in Hollywood. And Mara is intent chic in every shot — vagabond in a hand-me-down bridesmaid dress, high-waisted pants and striped button-down,

Things however takes a strange turn for the worse when Rooney’s son witnesses one of Sullivan and Thomas Maguire’s (Ernest Borgnine) hits. Maguire wants this to be looked over however Mr. Rooney threatens Maguire by stating “I’ll only hire boys so I can kill ‘em like I want to.” Immediately to this Distribute Life Insurances to Studio Accountants in New York City. Rooney sees this as rude and things change for the worse when Sullivan is kidnapped by Maguire who is later killed.

we've seen this done much, much better (Drive), worse (Mean Girls), and far worse (Heathers). To say nothing of everyone ripping off the late Wes Craven (Scream). But at the end of the movie, I wondered: How much of the plot was related to the original Scream but invented by the writers here? Even the review on the back of the DVD seemed not to know the answer, with the review beginning, "Last year's Smart yet distasteful, this clever slasher flick imitates - and improves upon - Scream..." It later says, "This film was marketed as a re-hash for horror buffs, but teenagers will love it for the novelty value." They don't elaborate on whether the novelty is due to the unexpectedly tight writing or to the unfortunately less-than-novel plotline. Many horror directors of late seem obsessed with satirically winking at the audience (especially dumb teenage audiences who think "winking" is oh such a nifty hip postmodernist thing to do), but maybe we are seeing (perhaps for the last time) the "clever satire" trend borrowing a page from George Lucas - the trend needs to be rewound to achieve its ne plus ultra, but it can never go farther.

knuckleduster this movie is for you. With an assortment of Euro Gothic title cards this movie feels exactly like an EC or Warren gothic horror but in colour. And lots of sloppy gore. And an odd synthesizer musical score that sounds like little Minimoog of the dead. This is together the blackest and most Italian of all the “Black Friday” Horror films. This is the “Rosebud “of those excellent Italian films that started in the 70s and ended with Trauma which was a bomb and didn’t spawn any more “trilogies”. It makes the 70s stuff look solid though. Not only did this cost less than two weeks pay but it also compensates for the money with a cast of Italian heart throb shufflers that took to the streets in the early 80s.

but the language is too coarse. You need a dictionary at hand by watching. Something totally unsuited. I can follow the story, but it was too brutal and sad. It was a typical Five program. I'm watching it ,'cause I'm in a mood and the title is attractive. as for all the other international films we have to know very well here. It's s very sad statment.

Please don't laugh at me!Maybe I'll like something different.It's well done, but a bit too realistic, I think NS aren't something I really would like to see. First, it was too sad and too coarse.

With this movie you wouldn't explain to a child. That
jump (or exclaim "holy s**t!"), but which will simultaneously have others combing over every scene for any semblance of credibility. For example -- one of the more memorable scenes is an extremely questionable trip down the stairs with an extension cord. But the larger problem of '1408' will be an inability to rouse much individual interest in its few salvageable concepts, especially since most viewers will immediately separate it from that questionably accurate source material. The film is nonetheless elevated by a few fine moments of acting (Hurt for one, has a nice moment in which he breaks down while trying to describe his grounds for inhumanity as a parent). ...all sugar coating, if you can stomach the formula you won't regret it. It seems as if it was made, based on a best-seller, by someone not used to the slow pace and multi-layered symbolism in older storylines. But it's made well -- if predictable -- and would be a good starter fee for newbies. It's not for hardcore horror fans who have seen this tedium many times before but if you have a date, no one else to go with, can't find The Protagonist, or are too young to see Hostel you could do much worse. I guess. That is - unless Yo isn't already familiar with

I tell them that it has been a long running, long in its offseasons, continuity soap opera a lot like "One Life to Live" and it's like a grown up "Sesame St." ... mostly about the main character Maggie (played by a wonderful woman whose name I can't remember). It's a great show and a lot of energy is put into the written word. I think that one day results in some fantastic poetic moments, not so much with the acting but for sure the writing. My theorem is proven many times this season...the more you repeat a catch phrase, the funnier it becomes. From this season, we now have 'Vote Maggie' tee's, my favorite 'point blank' quotes and that time Juno and Andy performed a duet to 'Jesus Loves Me.' Pretty much priceless.

a lot of entries to go). It has every bit of the fingers crossed pot boiler feel of a Hammer film like The Gorgon, two young hunky lovers as the protagonists and extremely tense and disturbing scenes, all the basic ingredients for a good chiller. What makes it stand out is the atmosphere it creates and the intelligence that fuels that atmosphere. Released in the same year as Rosemary's Baby, one can't help being reminded of Roman Polanski's masterpiece all the time when watching this film. It's similar theme, controlled pacing and mostly night-time focus immediately reminds of Rosemary's Baby, as does the plot element of adoption that Julian O'Rourke is obsessed with. The characters are well developed and we do indeed learn to care about their fortunes despite their immaturity. We only see one ghost, a gruesomely amputated corpse, perhaps The Bride Of Frankenstein's monster indeed, but it is so well done that it has more impact than any living body in the film. The voice is perfect, a real horror chill. The recording of the mother's monologue is greatly executed. The actors are all convincing and bring gravitas to a story about two young people as they do in Rosemary's Baby (a weird coincidence in that

being the beginning with the monster menacing that motorboat. Let me put this right, the monster isn't really that famous to us Pleistocene creatures, it's the invention of the characters for AE's sequel, what's his actual name called? Arthur Kipps. Everything that isn't the treatment and accounts of the main character's life are justifications for the director and cinematographer's performers to show us the various ways of befuddling and scaring the audience in every manner imaginable. All this conjuring of the Percussor is just a slight modification of the modern expressionist means to adapt the style of painting the town. It also causes irritating to the eyes, how sloppy the tad bit of CG implementation for a major scene that shows us a spectacle performance for the trampling motion via the putrescent geriatric legs that dangles over the cut. Aw crud, it's a bad rubbish filth beyond any minor vehemence baring you the absolutely rôle from the mere succession and replacement of that verb. It supposed to be given the spacial operation to get out of those pesky fleeting deaths. Aside from creative structures, there are lots of thrust bouncing around answering the call from the mice, quite comical funny passages. The movie's not completely bad though

are very dry and seem...for lack of a better concise explanation...overly rushed. I just don't really think they take their time with plots anymore. Even when they seem good I still don't think they're well written, because what's the point of a string of murder cases or whatever, if the viewer can solve it in five seconds or less? Story has taken a back seat to suspense and pre-downloaded plot devices. So basically it's not a bad show, but it's not nuanced enough anymore for me to build any attachment to it. Especially when they exec'd Stefanografie, and also killed Victoria Belkoff, I wish they would have added more Viskorifer to the cast. Besides Javier Guizon is really bad without a good cop partner. Not entirely to much fault with the cast though, with the new showrunners I think they've expanded their role without any volition, as they seem to be kind of "newbies" at the show. So yeah if they loved PT much, should they at least have been able to hold some kind of plot for the show? Sad they didn't. It's not unwatchable, but still. Not the show it was during the early seasons, or even season 8 actually. I think there's promise in the next season, but this season... I wish they could have added more Pointer
The whole film only revolved around shooting someone. The storyline did not hold up. The movie was a little too dark at times. I usually love these mobster films, but this one was terrible. Pacino’s performance was fine, but his acting could not make up for the lack of story. The film failed miserably. There was plenty of gore and violence which would make any sane person feel uneasy. To sum up, the movie was just plain disturbing. I give the film one out of five stars. The film is not worth wasting time on. There’s a reason why the film was released straight onto video. Probably the director of the film forgot to put in enough scenes for a feature film release. In the end “Death of a Ghost Hunter” is maybe one great trailer portraying a Genesis of a Matthew Fox sequel. The movie is just plain awful; the “Hacker” director doesn’t know what he is doing or thinking. This film is a perfect example of how a director creates a terrible film. At the end of the film I was still wondering…what is the point of the movie???? It was not worth watching. The film will surely disappoint any Pacino fan. “Death Of A Ghost Hunter” is no 80’s hit or his role in “Scarface.” Three out of Five stars!!! I only recommend this film to hardcore Pacino fans only
Tobi 2, but Lowell was a very underwhelming villain. He never wanted to act as if he was in a movie to capture the spirit of raping Minnie the Mouse. He gets a lot of very serious lines. Still, despite all this, he did better than I expected since he was not good in Junior Partners. As Julie Ivanov, Edith Ivey played the role of a personal assistant to Lowell. For a character, Edith Ivey is a very very funny character. Funny is good things are really on the side. She can be found very funny, but she does not stand out, but she is very funny. She was already in God Said, "Ha!" Ivey has given cut performances in movies where she was asked to speak in character. As an extra, I think it would be fun to be together with Lemon Van Hauzen and see how fun he can be. I still find Lemon to be a great character actor and a delightfully funny lady to be with. If this movie had better written scripts for her, she might've shined more. I still think Lemon needs to be given a chance to shine better in more movies. He is deserving. A recent example is his performance in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. I think Lemon needs to emerge from movies in which other characters ste
customized cars, hot chicks, funny dialogue and hot action and thrills. I loved this movie. I mean this movie has everything. It's a movie for people who want to have fun and be thrilled. Who doesn't like a hardass, trouble loving young man kicking some ass, outrunning the man, thrilling to rock music, and driving superfast in his incredibly cool muscle car that just so happens to have power that any car man would lust for. Jason Statham (playing the main role) has a star quality that I don't know how, but isn't sickening. Every character played by him is not sickening or annoying. The drawback from Death Race is that it doesn't really bring a whole new perspective to the Death Race movie subject, but nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. Plus, this isn't supposed to be SyFy at it's best, but IMHO, this movie is the perfect example of how SyFy were meant to be - light hearted, rock music filled, entertaining and exciting movies. It's a B-movie with good directing, acting, stunts and good effects. It's a bit Incredible Hulk, and there isn't any shocking depth to the movie that makes you really think. But then again, this isn't the type of movie you

but everywhere it's referred to it's different titles: Homicidal Maniac, alias Night Of The Demon/Demon Hunter, a horror film that a, if I see correctly, crazy masked assassin works for the wrong side and b, comes from somewhere in Europe. There's a killer on the loose, who turns out to be Alfred, with the voice of ...on and on. Hell, I didn't get anything out of it. I liked the combination of gratuitous nudity (only dared to show tits) with in-your-face violence. There is no way you can't like this film at the same time. Things are being cut, Paris Hilton is watching, and the true meaning of masturbation (its gutter value, at least) is made clear. If you're marked "I'll buy it/see it if video nasty", well, this one is for you. It's for those of you who want a saw, a machete and a few gallons of blood, death and dismemberment on a video cassette. If you can also buy a video cassette, it's worth seeing. One reason is, it becomes clear. Ahead of the times. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. A lot. But decapitations and hacking off limbs, and the weapon the psycho is
able to design perfect athletes. The games commissioner is interested in this research and applies it to professional athletes. Still, he very soon notices that some unexplainable mutations are beginning to take place in the physical characteristics of the athletes (they're looking more normal).. In fact, all this activity ultimately leads to a unique species, which begins to destroy mankind... There will be a lot of violence, whenever the monsters appear. But they are also good when needed, e.g. they feel affection towards one's child, believe they were rightfully manipulated and therefore protect the professor, even love each other, etc. They begin to grow on you. It's a comedy gradually turning into a querfy and grotesque multi-episode thriller that will shock you with excess. In the series there will be, or course, monsters, but at a certain point they will be integrationged onto the set so that they'll make life difficult for the actors. There will be many 'battles' in the series. Doomed or safe monsters will die. This series will certainly be a great contribution to the genre of horror series. There will be love, beliefs, chuckles and of course music. All carefully selected and domestically made spiced up with a very powerful storyline. In the future, we will have 3 terms, each term with approximately 10 episodes
have been just flat-out nuts, but then again, you can see it disappearing so fast behind Home Alone and the new installment of the Rocky series that it’s understandable that somebody didn’t want to risk alienating audiences or test their patience. It gets the job done anyway, and you know that it’s a timeless comedy, making it perfectly suited for repeated viewings while stuck inside sweating out the flu. There are some fine comedians here, though I admit to not remembering some of them and being unable to tell who they are — Ron Leesman, who steals every scene, and Terrence Scammell, for example, both of whom I wanted to put into future lineups to act as more supportive hands for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson when they came visiting the Amanda Peet household. I do wonder though, why it always seems to be either students or teachers sticking matches in cheeks, and then extinguishing them elsewhere — I don’t know why there aren’t more bloody eye injuries or something with all the projectiles flying about. You’ll love this for what it is — a charming little setup that isn’t full of “aw shucks”-ness, but also isn’t Mafia vigilante justice, or any other level of criminality. It really is that odd
with a relax drum beat and strained rhythm about evils of the western culture (that they don't understand). But yes, obviously I'll skip it. Weirdly, put it in a sampling like that...it may have appeal. But again, I can't hear it. But Love the clarity of your story. And a thought that the inflation may have been due to currency manipulations and suppressions. Like the US gets accused of. Currency wars. . But those countries were smart. That's called economic attacks!!! And they prevailed at that. I can't wait when they open their wallets without a swipe card in about 10 years. I hope no one becomes step children and idiots to global society. Kicking the US economy down...doesn't give you an edge that long....unless your using your labor to U.S. manufacturing bots that are making my house hold goods, clothing and electronics in Chicagoland in giant warehouse complexes. The current crop of free trade America labor that fought for Berlin in WWII lacks no intelligence. Their sorry the experience was paid for them. I know it makes sense to segment and separate. But I hope the world works our a sense of awareness ASAP. Quota your social media and boundary those that have bought your attention by keeping you wanting to know more about them
And Melanie it’s no different for her. After her brother dies in Western Territories enlisting in the US military she moves to Edwards where he died with the purpose to get a job paying enough wages to pay the fees for her at the girl school where she got an expensive boarding school education. She has never fired a gun before, her middle name is Melisande and inside she suffers like women in western stories as expected, best as she could while waiting at the parade ground, impatient that it should start. From the very beginning that is when women start to behave and dress more like men they are sent to the brothels and here her endings are as probable as Western uplifting climaxes but not, luckily for her, with happy endings. But not that more. She wants to write a book about what happens to the ordinary girls at the far west. She mets Capt. Dunlap, the commander of the military ensions that is to conduct the review of the troops. Dunlap is much more than the average military hero and the novel also lets us see him as nonconventional by boring eyes of suited man and soldier in uniform. Though, when he is in a lift, or on horseback, you would say he is a hero. On his way from viewing the troops, he first hears of a man at the fort, who claimed he had murdered a
how rich people cheat when they do a trade and get loss (while poor people can only get loss eventually). But on the other side, she depicts merchants in street as evil people who causes the poverty, both internationally and domestically. There should be a balance of positive perspective on each character. Also, the direction is just rudimentary. It doesn't make the movie into an interesting or fleet of foot or convincing movie. But also, her point is a simple one and doesn't had enough attractions for people to watch it. <<<So-so>>> 4.6/10. A sad story, made worse by the use of sensational dramatic licence, so that a fundamentally true/historical story ends up bearing little resemblance to the truth. In fact the movie is so far from the truth, that a cockney back sleeping under a bridge for all those months was unlikely to pass through without Grosvnor picking him up as a fresher scrabble. Me and a few friends went to see this movie yesterday......Now before I start this review I have to say that I'm used to following Janeaus history and style, the facts of what I know about us history and I also know that film directors never really cover a time span in it's depth which is fine with me. Having said all that....this film was on
I’m not talking about George R.R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire, I am talking about The Handmaiden. The Handmaiden is a wonderful homage to the seduction, betrayal, obsession and good versus evil themes found in that medieval classic. It was based on the novel of the same name by Sarah Waters. The Handmaiden is the directing debut of Chan-wook Park, although he has a formidable filmmaking résumé. In fact, he is perhaps best known for his Oldboy. The source novel is close enough to the film to give it a hybrid name. The book is Fingersmith, but was Fingersmith set in Korea? Because it kind of feels like that. I don’t know much about Korean culture outside of film lore, so I don’t have a lot of context. Executioners, betrayals, dragonslayers and all. But the film is very much Korean-inspired, and it has a very whimsical tone to it. We teeter on the edge when we are watching The Handmaiden.Will all this betrayal, lust, obsession and good versus evil converge toward the tragically perfect ending? It was so like a poem: elaborate and suspenseful, but still an allegory. If you think about it, even Pale Rider was kind of a poem
as generally expected from him, the subtleties in his gestures were all very well, but he somehow managed to capture a deal of the strength of his characters as well. There was nothing quite as refined as Lantern, but the drama was comprehensible nevertheless. I wasn't even paying attention to the story of Johnny Ringo and Doc, and I still know enough about that to understand where the story was going. The central theme of the movie, about Dad's dreams for his boyd Thursday and his daughter Sunday, and their own, different dreams is handled quite well. The first hour, a bit unnecessarily, seemed quite a slow build-up for that, and I can't say I was very keen on it, but Altman manages to keep the viewer's attention on the important things like that. It's one of those movies, where the all-star cast features almost everyone, and to me, it didn't seem to feature too prominently as it does in Daddy Longlegs, Dnes and zítra or Beard, but their scenes resonate actually. Even William Sells has something to settle, as well as Rosenberg. I wish Muni and O'Hara had a bit more to do, as they make their presence felt, but they aren't given many shots, other than the ones with tourists. I wasn
but everything is very clear in my memory.There was a program of Tintin on television everyday, after school. I just saw your message and I can relive with this movie my childhood.I was so moved by this movie. I searched some information about this movie and I got this full movie in French.Every time this movie comes in black and white on television, I sit down and I stop everything to watch it.Even with terrible translation, translation the truth of the movie.I was searching on internet and I found this forum with an interesting debate, and then I write you telling what I'm thinking.It is an emotional journey, enlightening discoveries, a visually rich environment where you feel like you belong. I even read that it was the first 70 mm film, I think this story is fascinating.I wish so much to share with every one these beautiful moments of these men and their dreams, their hopes, their funny moments, their discovery. Somebody that love cinema, that love a movie that just take itself a shot, and each shot blows your head, in a beautiful natural atmosphere.I hope so much to share with every one. Thank you very much." − Nathalie Roche, Paris, France. —With thanks to Tony Plummer. [SOS!] Springfield columnist Plummer wrote the column at left . . . as he told Playboy
middle school. This movie is like one big pop song. Crazy to think that I used to watch this over Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. That's how 80's guilty I am. Even back then I never understood why George's dad became so angry with George after the karate tournament. When I saw this movie in the dollar bins at Walmart, I had to buy it because it brought back a lot of memories. Ever wonder about the "robots" in Karate Kid part 2? (a.k.a. "Let's Do This"). Well, it turns out that these mechanical men are called Mr. Mikis and were made in the Philippines at a factory that used to make plastic pails for a company known as Eskay. My best friend David's parents are from the Philippines and at one of his family parties, they had this Mr. Mikis action figure that I had never seen before. (BTW, my first exposure to the Philippines were through the reading materials at my optometrist. I was in the seventh grade and she had some Philippine guy doin' her books). I grew up in a Jewish neighborhood so I'd never seen a Filipino in the wild before. I was all like "What is that thing? It's got that crazy mohawk and is wearing a suit!". Turns out
if I had seen what was in this piece. I have always wondered what went into a behind the scenes of films graphic & I was sooooo not ready for this. If you can take it, then great, but, I couldn't take what any of the actors went through in this piece. I think that I prefered the walk onto the 1912 Titanic in the movie "Titanic" to this piece. Think?! Scary!!!! Bravo! for a definitive perspective on what a special effect's crew does for movies. Now, when's "Lord Of the Rings" flying out? Seen that one yet? Yeah, I haven't either... it's just talk about the creation of special effects. Yup, I'll stay behind the scenes. Thank goodness. But, you will not know this until the end of the piece.

hope. Well executed though. I think then that the title speaks of two things- firstly, the reward is possibly for making out that the Earth is a dead deserted husk, and secondly for selling that illusion. What is a good film anyway? One that leaves you moved, laughing, questioning, feeling alive or better, or even sad with a sense that it is good to keep feeling, in odd bits. This had a little of the last but not really. Unfortunately, sort of like William McIlvaney's Watching the Clarke girl- sometimes art seems to say something that does not seem so true! Mind you kangaroo stew with a stone dish glass.....so many surprising instances a world in which to fight a battle that was certainly won- lost but won!?!?!?!?!!?!!  perhaps maybe I saw it very wrong. Unknow- but no. Unheroic, unromantic and ashen. I have seen better from the south. I still think I have'nt interpreted it wrong!    Beauty in death.

the black and white monotone color scheme and was a bit bored with the melancholy storyline. I wanted to be entertained and was not being entertained. It was not til the final scene that I learned that the gun is emasculation, the rose refers to the heart and the wallet is made of paper- all symbols of things that are not pure or not authentic. So the message is to seek what is real, pure and true for you and find your own way- the movie does not feed you answers:) What does this mean to me? Determine who you are at heart, on your own terms and stay the course. We are living in a whirlwind of contradictory views and negative programming towards our salvation, so it is easy to get confused. Being true to yourself on a daily basis is a challenge. Be awake. Enjoy! Carpe Diem. Bad Boy Bubby Rules. Namaste!Johnboy. Be very aware of consumer spending. Forget the fake cotton and support the US cotton farmers. Keep your money in your pocket.

accent, and Reni Santoni, as Bobo, the Italian mecha-nani, he’s really unconvincing as Italian! Anyone I have ever met or seen from that country, there’s nothing robotic about them but he did pull off the grille master and sausage genius roles perfectly LOL. Plus, you gotta love all the references to the times and the cameos from Henry Gibson and Captain Kangaroo. Ip Daley movie… Saturday Night Spanish double feature, what a hoot since Bobo reminds Putt and Arnie constantly. Oh and I can’t forget Fat Jack that was played to perfection probably my personal favorite character. Or that one Wacky Racer’s guy.. “Wally, you say you want to get back into pro kickboxing? I think you have the temperament for something cabareovy” Of course, not to mention the great reference to Goldfinger with Winnie who I will always associate as robot Maria from Metropolis.. or just Maria from soap operas of the time, “Oh Herman, Christian will never forgive you.” Dr. Cyclops movie and the bleached blond Zsa Zsa Gabor, had me in stitches again.. And hey what about over in Chinatown defending his manhood against Walker at the sexy Mai Lee’s nightclub. L
be re-released with the return to home video and DVD of The Gruffalo (2009). The Gruffalo is based on a children's book written in 1999 by the award winning English author Julia Donaldson. The book is a poem about a mouse who uses clever devices to escape from her predators. It is now a part of UK culture and regularly features in tv programmes as well as having been dramatised as a theatre production. This is a beautiful animated short from Magic Light Pictures which takes us into the depths of the forest in a wonderful adventure based on the book and shown in spell binding shadow puppetry. The eponymous visual for the beast was inspired by the phrase 'prickly, knobbly, warty, lumpy and dumpy'. The music was composed by Patrick Doyle which adds significantly to the drama of the piece. This modern classic made its first debut in 2009 and was nominated for many awards including an Oscar. Watch it to find out whose side you would take on meeting this Gruffalo. I found it has been enjoyed by people around the world. But its still a silly, funny UK thing! the official link is www.gruffalonews.com here it is as a little preview... Enjoy! you can by it on DVD the official website is www.gruffalonews.com; If you
as a reasonably worthwhile film. The photography is dynamically if confusingly set up, the sound is uneven but manageable, much time has evidently been spent on the visual effects, and nonchalance has prevailed when it comes to genre conventions. Will Gardner plays a young boy named Bobby, apparently the devout son of a preacher, who appears to be growing increasingly unstable. This instability is not entirely undeserved, as Bobby's mother tragically dies on Halloween after tripping over a string of lights which Bobby had carelessly left lying on the floor hours before. Six years later, in a one-room school house, we observe two sisters who aren't dressed in costume - but it turns out that they've come back from class with this year's Harvest Fest prize: the legendary Pumpkinhead mask, which tells the story of the man whose soul is that of Pumpkinhead. Bobby, who like Charlie Brown longs to participate in the class Halloween pageant but is chronically rejected instead, sees the girls arrive, and he recounts the story of Pumpkinhead and ties it into his growing insecurity: "The Headless Horseman doesn't slow down until he makes the one who is riding him wish that he was alone again". Bobby, it seems, is romantically and sexually frustrated
fun in years. The movie is one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. The direction, acting, scenery, cinematography--nuf said. This movie is going to be great when it gets released in early to mid October. I'm getting another advanced screening tonight, but this time at the AMC Oakbrook 2 with some of my close friends.

dozens upon dozens of songs that magically present themselves across 2 hours of filmmaking. After all, it is for a sad reason that this was banned by their record company. While trying to sell the last movie rights, Allen Klein and his gang went on and sued Apple for the unthinkable, for copyright infringement that is, of concert footages used on Let It Be Naked. Apple lost, and the release scheme for the Yellow Submarine and Let It Be documentaries was thus put out of business. While technically all is not lost, The Magical Mystery Tour did, in terms of its X rating (suggestive sexual behavior) and evangelizing image of the movie discourages some retailers to carry it. So there go another source of delight. If you can get your hand on it, try not to lose it again. A half eaten heart in this DVD is a half eaten heart in the Beatles lineage. Bottom line - This is a theatrical film that needs to remain on the big screen. Watch it, and you will sure feel blue. Let It Be started off with an idea from Paul, complete with pictures and songs. The scenario, for those who did not get the director's cut of Let It Be, was : 10 days of Beatles music made in a frolicking way. Not really a documentary but more
EVER? Where was anyone when Sarah Michelle beard was slaying vampires in the original series though??? You people are clueless. Average for me would have been an 8-3. Bring on the Serenity, Firefly, Doctor Who repeats. I don't care about continuity anyway. RDJ isn't in it. Enjoy your reruns of "Dawson's Creek". P.S. I only watched the pilot and second episode...but managed to stay around long enough for the humSee more...ling vampire brothel...who starts acting out of character. LOL NOPE! 0.5 Stars "Buffyverse" has ruined vampires and werewolves for life. I blame Joss. Luckily, they were crappy to begin with. He might as well have kicked them while they were down. I feel just like Wood did choking the Master...as if I wanted this. I nearly threw up. Pikes addiction was better. Ambushing the female...I mean, weak male villain with a stake when they are most vulnerable was not slasher like...it's been done way too many times. The flashbacks to Buffy as a slayer are painful. It just makes all the Netflix original shows we all cancelled look like they were nominated for O
be very good. For some reason, I was thinking it was going to be a southwestern western with Indians stealing the white men's horses to a hay hollering tune in the background. Yes, I know there would be more to it, I just didn't really expect much from it. I was pleasantly surprised by how much of a premium mini-series this was. The filming is done with such finesse, and the acting is not even up for debate. Jerry O'Connell (yes, the same Jerry O'Connell from Stand by Me and Jerry Maguire) is outstanding. He plays Captain Woodrow F. Call (Matt Damon's character from Lonesome Dove ) without a speck of evidence pointing to that his resemblance to Damon. Same accent, same mannerisms, same look, and same love for Gus (Robert Duvall's character) in the first movie. I was amazed, and The depiction of Captain Call's battle between his moral compass and his blossoming as a lover to Captain's wife, Sarah, is very intriguing. Again, Jerry O'Connell's portrayal of the two sides is superb. Being a man of principle and knowing that what he wants is not right to go after, Captain Call faces many difficulties as he watches Gus fall more and more

that had to be shown was already shown in the trailer that I have seen on tv months ago. It's too boring, and they watered down lesbian love. Hard to believe this is almost a love(lesbian) story without showing much of sexual orientation. This is just a boring movie with very short princess space in it. I would say it's worth 20$ at most if you want to see it in theaters. One thing I noted was that the best song in the movie wasn't played in the movie. They should have played "If I die young", it kept playning in the trailer and I love the song. I despise whore journolist media as always. They gave it 3/4 stars b/c it's based on a book or b/c it's Biblical. Got it, orlandoflame.com. I'm bored. Crap, I can sleep better than this. There should be several other reviews on this page, I can't be the only one who was bored in "Noah"! Asteroid rain shower- sorry, I mean movie, would've been more exciting than this crap. Same goes for Oliver Stone Biblical epic "Savages" trilogy actually. Or a book or soundtrack. Not exactly related to "Noah" other than not being
I came to this film completely unbiased, I have never even watched the original Steve McQueen film but since reviewing indie movies like The Hunting Party, I have a great understanding of just how difficult it is to make a true, credible and interesting film that is based upon a good book or another classic film with a very famous cast, when set in a War torn and present day country, even more so than my book on the current situation in Congo based novels as this story is set in Lebanon, a war that I did not feel qualified to comment on in the book review, thankfully whilst reading the book, recent events had lead to me developing many opinions about Libya, Iraq... ) My first movie review of the year and I now see why I stopped reviewing films with big star names and lots of pre-awareness, it always seems that there is more work to be done on a more obscure title. Any movie set in a war zone begs the question ”Why an American film” and any movie based on a previous classic requires a faith in the storyline and direction, as we do not have to see Marlon Brando in the role and a good reason as to why the remake is looking at a new way to tell the story. The earlier movie was about war and that is to the fore in this movie, Jack, is now, a war photographer and despite the date change to Lebanon
English. The more films done in French the better, I say. In fact, I'm dubious about any movie where people are speaking French for the first part and English for the rest. What SIMPLY couldn't be done in French? That's almost a little too hard to believe.. Of course, not being familiar with the politics of moviemaking in this former french colony, I could be totally wrong. But I doubt it. I guess it's good for folks ears, how? Hey, Montréal was the French metropolis Montréal was French speaking, no? At least mostly. Sure it was every other language of the world, but when they wanted something, they spoke in French. Which is what made a few yankee cops turned rapstars (Ernest antoine yo) want to act like tough guys in French, as if you understood them. It's disgusting. This movie did have a few interesting twists to it, but overall I think it was a poor excuse for being in English, when it could have at least been bilingual. I Don't have a problem, as such , with actors playing homosexual or otherwise, who HAPPEN to be straight, like the ridiculously handsome Charlie Hunnam, who's name I only know since Literal Space by Literal space.com put him in the strangely hand
cab driver in anticipation of someone coming out of the building across street was so realistic it could not have been rehearsed- stupid made up scenes in the play don't work, so the writers just became a bit more honest, like neo realists. There's a lot of scenes where Maerosa and Mezza are in a seemlingly "casual" conversation nonchalantly shooting the breeze while sitting by a tool box at their Bedford Avenue warehouse with other guys working around them. Yet the feel is of conversations about to shock everyone listening, as they discuss ways to interrogate an honest witness. The apartment scenes are to me the carefree reliving of the before, an Italian derivation of American expat Paris memoirs written like Hemmingway, Bulgakov, and Bellow. Doing it while young and black and idealistic, breaks outside the restrictive age limit that the honestly spoken inner most struggles usually demands. That when the character says he won't be paranoid that it really means you better not be paranoid, because that is there reality. All that yes the other gangster movies are good, but Godfather is the boldest when it comes to the honesty and the deception of looking into a fantasy lifestyle that actually still looks enduring and safer until the final scene. Maybe that's the saga line
starring Edmond Lowe is not like this. This film diverges (pounded rock?) from reality, but in good ways, so you will still like it. The problem is that they are selling fake death metal!!!! (The song "Body Bag" by Authority Zero is not death metal). This movie should win several "Baloney Awards". It may not be all bad, but the trash does in a sense outweigh the useful information. I mean they constantly reference the "Death Rock" genre, but that band Intro-Sect is DEATHPOP and not death metal at all! There are other scenes that are in a sense wrong too. The thing that really made me mad is that they seemed to have packed smiles of truth that I love in a trash can. I will not mention names. So I say watch the interview, we do not need some idiot music producer explaining how death metal works, and don't let anyone ruin it for you. I actually did not buy into this messed up theory of Aerosmith starting death metal (shivers!), but you know what? Give those hip dark goth guys some great music!! Maybe Keith Richards will write a really cool death metal song (the corpse I rest in is at peace)?! (LOL). But here is some other stuff that is totally wrong- Sinister, The Big Bad Wolves. Like it or
. It is now his job not only to lead the Ronson Troop but also to put up with all the silly actions of them and their ideas. I thought that Michael Bishop had done a remarkable job bringing out dramatic irony in his poems. Throughout his poem he does his best to elicit humor in the people reading it and moreover to shock them. I believe it is ironic that he enlists stereotypes of human behavior towards accompany a boy scout troop of the opposite gender. For example, page eight, the scoutmaster proclaims violently, “No bowling from the corner and no ping- pong from the alley end! This is all the appropriate training for children!” (8). This troop is nothing like the BSA (Boys Scouts of America) because Scouting is for everyone and this troop is for girls. Scoutmaster Robert isn’t treating the scouts like little girls. I thought that they were getting taught how to be men, and then to realize that this scoutmaster is prejudiced against these girls and doesn’t even want them in his troop. This is terrifying because this social stereotype is subtly portraying the boys that don’t fit what a typical troop is supposed to be and that’s quite a scary topic to confront. Bishop also points out the scoutmaster ever so fe

this movie at a solid 7. It was very funny, the plot developed quite well, and just what you'd expect from an LH episode. I usually don't like when they try to translate the macabre gun/murder/gang violence of the LH episode onto the screen, but this movie was fun. Well worth watching if you want a more thorough indulgence in Sei's near-fatal ordeal- not to mention his sexual awakening with young Takano. What a treat! This movie is how the TV series should have ended. Great fun. Upgrade this to 6.0. T.....sweet. It'll be worth it. Enjoy!

A lot. I mean, yes, it is rather funny, yes it is an original story. But... The first time I saw it, it really wasn`t funny, and it sure wasn`t much more than just 'another' humor romantic movie. But I thought "Well I'll give it the benefit of the doubt", so I watched it another time, again "well funny but
Rhames again, but look at how Downey has gone to pieces. Sad. I'm going to savor this one in my memory for a while before I watch it again. One final word: if you want to see a film in a theater and you have the option, don't go with Ben Affleck. The idea of seeing a guy who looks like a female lesbian swaying about to the music in a film like this makes me nauseous. Tacky and ludicrous especially for this particular film. It stole the film away from me! I refused to look at him and just waited for the film to proceed! In the end I would give it a -2 for Ben Affleck! Ugh. If all goes well I'm ready to request a refund. Very disappointing film. By the end I no longer cared for any of the characters. I did enjoy seeing Ving Rhames again, but look at how Downey has gone to pieces. Sad. I'm going to savor this one in my memory for a while before I watch it again. One final word: if you want to see a film in a theater and you have the option, don't go with Ben Affleck.

don't dare to purchase it. It might have been okay in the 90's when people decided the "Baywatch" approach was the way beach movies should be. However, this is over a decade after, and Phat Beach is a clumbsy, awful attempt at a beach movie. The plot is not even important to explain since it really doesn't matter anyway in the end. Perhaps the worst part about Phat Beach is the acting. Oh my god, if only Maria Ford's cashing in Spanish speaking roles included a decent final paycheck from the makers of this movie. Then again, the cast is overacting pretty bad in general. The humor, if you can call it that, is very strange with more F-bombs then humor, as if they wrote an "unfunny comedy" for so-so offensive humor. This is a no budget, bottom of the barrel movie, that is pretty much on the same level as a horror movie you have to rent from the store's horror section, where the movie is so bad and its so cheaply produced; it has fallen off from the mainstream, even though you have probably heard of it. Levity is the farthest thing from what anyone with a brain would look for in this movie; and Chevy Chase pratically mocks his past performances in this movie as well. Perhaps the only person who has a
. He was one of millions affected by the 9/11 tragedy in New York City. He died from cancer. I still like the movie. It's a good one. Horse lovers say Walter played the Popup Groom scene very well. The horse's name is Chego. He and I have been very close since the movie hangs over both of us. He is the luckiest horse in the world. He is a Paint. The other horse in the movie is Niko. He was found in a garbage bin. He and his statue, Hi-Ho Silver, shipped to Scotland from New Orleans Plaza. Hi-Ho Silver was on Bayou St. John. Near Spanish Plaza. That why I am in Scotland now.... Well, that, the Marathon Weekend, a home exchange, and a lot of other reasons. Walter had a good career. I still like this one, behind him was 9-11. I love Walter Matthau. He had a dream.

ads on other TV networks, it was clearly stated that the show was about a couple of escorts. It’s whether TV Guide, or other TV guide material clearly explainen what the show is about. If it is advertised on NBC and it’s ABC show, the least they could do is to promote the show as widely as possible. Otherwise, you can’t expect people to watch the show if they have a misdirected ad. If you are a fan of the show, there is no possible way for you to watch all your favorite TV show without viewing them all at the same time. So, you have to watch the show and the ads to get the real point across. The best way to do that is to watch the show multiple times without viewing the ad. That’s not the ideal way to watch all your favorite TV shows. In order to make sure that you get the correct point across, you should watch the show more than once. If you want to watch the show over again, you can visit site to see which of the copies of your favorite show is the best copy to get. Here are some excerpts to the first two parts of this article.

us get together and I bring slices of REAL pizza, and we dine and watch bad movies, but we do it in an upstairs room in a restaurant, and we have a bartender too, so it's not really meant to be a real movie night, but a hilarious movie bash, if you dig. Anyway, it's really interesting the different films we all love, young and older, and how we discuss them, and make up our own minds what makes a film bad, and what makes it bad in a good way. I love beautiful, amazing films, and watch A LOT of them, but I still love bad movies. They are just so fun to share, laugh, and bash. It's fun to have a drink with friends and make jokes at the expense of a bad film. Everyone can have a bad film or two they love in heart. It just has to be done right. Well, Skeleton Key is NOT done right by a very LONG shot. I thought I'd give this film a 1 star, if that high, but the more I thought about it, the more I was stumped! What's good or likeable about it? Nothing that I can see, but still I can't find an overall way to really bash it. I guess I can bash the script. This is GAWBLEY stupid.

of our country, who fight for our freedom without getting the appreciation they deserve. Full Metal Jacket is vital to watch if you want a real insight into what some view as a horrific part of American history. Not only does it give you a feel of life during the war, but Stanley Kubrick’s excellent directing says it all. He has captured the nerve of the soldiers’ situation really well. He also shows us the tragic possibilities that press upon them and force them into circumstances that they would not have seen coming. For example, the D.I. showing the war to the boys must have thought his actions were saving lives but they actively made the soldiers kill each other and everyone else. Apart from the characters and my appreciation to the brave soldiers, the dialogues in the movie are also very spot on and easily relatable. You actually get into the character’s psyche and can feel what he/she feels. I highly recommend the movie to everyone. It will give you tremendous insight. However, my favorite movie is a movie that depicts intense fear and uncertainty associated with what war can bring. Terry Gilliam’s “Twelve Monkeys” is my favorite movie because of the drama, science fiction and the fear it instills in the viewer. – John and Maria and Erik, Rosewood Nursing Home comments on the freedom they enjoy while others fight to uphold their basic
can only be described as a bad film. It's difficult to see how something like this was made with such good intentions but got it all so utterly wrong. You can truly tell where the money and information was missing by the inhuman and false dialogue falling off the screen from all the actors. The shocking thing about this film, apart from the unsettling acting, is that it could have been excellent. It has a fascinating story, a simple but complex concept and that is now ruined under the sturdy ribs of weak acting and an even weaker script. I am sorry, I usually feel forced to tear apart films but here I feel massively disappointed. Glad that the film will be promptly forgotten. I just hope whoever was involved in this mess learns from their mistakes and understands not everyone gets to really be a director. We are in countdown now as I will have less than ten films left on this L-Zep, that can only be a good thing, I hope. Avoid. Absolutely. There is better Darwinism out there by a margin. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid it. AVOID IT. Avoid! AVOID! AVOID! This is so bad... Avoid. Avoid. Avoid! ... And you may ask yourself why am I avoiding this, in detail? Because of masked dialogue like this; '
its source material. In this case it was a single film and the film is not one of his better. It also introduced to popular culture many of synthesized vocalizations, even though the film used real animal noises. That synth engine that comes with Windows is even called "Aretha" after having a sample from Gladys Knight's version of "Respect". And here's a film that laid down many of those sounds and samples. And now it takes on a lot more popular cultural relevance every time someone says "Africa; I've got to go home." Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz is more impressive than his work in Godfather. The France/Vietnam metaphor is weakened both, and I was surprised how effective the flashback sequence of Kurtz was, made doubly effective because it didn't BS its audience, like most Hollywood flashbacks nowadays. Living outside the U.S. in Asia, there's a lot more that a soldier can relate to here. They can put up with a lot darker shit than the American audience, possibly because Hollywood doesn't make films strong enough for an allAmerican audience. The difference between an American audience and a Korean audience is that scannon shots sound like they would really be painful. A little bit more violence wouldn't go bad here, and Brando gives a fine performance that is brutally funny and brilli
to a mom with a toddler, who happens to be sitting in the seat in front of them. Lisa picks up the child and puts it on the seat of the empty seat next to her, and the mom says “oh you must be a grandmother”. Lisa says “actually no, he’s not my grandson”. Then Lisa says “he just believes that grandmother’s are magic!” “Do you?” Replies the kid. “Yes”, Lisa says. So she opens up her bag and takes out a cookies & cream fudge brownie. The kid gives her a hug and makes sure that she gets home safe. Lisa asks again “can I be your grandmother?”, to which the little boy responds “yes!”. Lisa hugs her child that she’s never seen before. Lisa asked: “ How did you know my name was Lisa?” The little boy responds: “God only FAITH me!” Lisa says: “ You are right little guy, God does only FAITH me.”. Lisa thinks to herself “God is just so awesome! He hears every prayer”. “Amen!” she says, “Who knows, maybe we can chat each other up in heaven?” She looks in the mirror. Lisa slowly starts to walk towards her young child. They both hold hands and walk towards the exit door. They both say I love you” at the exact same time
up in that area, opening the story to new and exciting plot twists for those who enjoyed the show. And even for people who didn't, as long as they are familiar with "Homicide", they should enjoy the movie. However, several serious problems come up, some technical, others plot-related. Still, if you give these a pass, you'll find that you truly underwent T.J. Hooker during its lifetime. You suffered, you suffered, and now it's time to reap your rewards by watching an all-out-slo-mo HK-69 fight scene. Good thinkin'!!!!! "Outstanding"! Caroline H. McKeever wrote this review.

Friday the joke that drags on for about 5 minutes with Alyssa and Justin is hilarious. Favorite part has gotta be the shower scene with Jaeden and Ashleigh though. Watching Jaeden get insanely wasted is great along with her argument with the stripper who makes out with Matt. Also the part when Matt found out Jacinthe, Justin and Nasfet had drunken ruffiages: "They raped my dog and then they stole my car". The acting is so-so at times, but I expect that from a cheesy independent like this. The bad acting almost makes it worse than Fast Times anyway. The stunts do look great despite a man unconvincingly pulling helicopter landing jokes and a man unconvincingly driving with no hands. Oh man the camera guy could not hold stunt car back in a tight turn.[img] As far as plot goes the jocks and nerds and Cornyerds part is so unoriginal, still there is potential for a good movie with it. The ending was been done to which makes it be a creatively easier. The gang is 3-dimensional but not all at the same time (Matt is the most die hard, Petpir is
Smith) is appointed the new warden. Facing down the corrupt old leadership running the prisons (who don’t necessarily want to go away, in fact …), Sharpe faces an utterly out-of-control mess. Rents are too damn high. Outside contracts have been awarded based on cronyism, not merit or the needs of the prison itself, and things are about to get worse with regard to the joys of all that fresh-air running classtime. It’s against this backdrop that we meet our two new guards, dream-visionary Chris Money (Harry O’Reilly) and rocker Lt. Jimmy Stillwell (Nelson Franklin) and they are not going to fit in with some old-time prison charm. Chris is gay and out (to his girlfriend and parents), he did not get the prison job due to nepotism but he smoked a lot of weed and rocked his interview, and Jimmy does not play well with others in the office. Ultimately it ultimately falls to a new class of start young inmates to help out the social justice prisoners and truly make things better. And as they said in the sixties, that’s no small change. Enter Justice Yancy Fry, his crew of OTT heroes in Skye and Bear, the witches Mrs. Slaughter/McDonald and T
disappointment his character does not stand out with attitude or comedic presence, rather passive with a mediocre acting. The rest of the performances are far from being convincing either. Amy Heideman and Adam Pally are the only TV cast members, and I once again found there acting awful. In my opinion there characters seem forced and unreal. This might be related to the script: A series of events that keep struggling between the realistic and unrealistic; it is exposed to the public in a caring, though sucking way. It is definitely not an entertaining or funny movie which makes me appreciate the cases and story in re-watched programs, advance conversations and special make-up as positive moments of the film. Actually, Rostholz has done no serious apology for its sense of humor, the picture gives me a very narrow thing, and We Are Your Friends on the hand does not promote intractability. In short, I would not recommend this movie, and I doubt it has the power to attract neither the popular audience nor the movie critics. Worst acting and script I have come across recently. Highly disappointing. I agree completely with the comment binaryharry wrote in IMDB. In the cinemas, there is film in real life. Having captured on the screen only unqualified actors and transferring a very mediocre comedy. All the same, create a house comedy, but no alternative to

a cheap 1985 production. It’s insane people like Jeb Hensley who send the government agency that would oversee his films into bankruptcy. Is Jeb for real? To do a film with a 2 buck dvd box you buy at the ten cent store, and not expect sh*tty quality is beyond me. This is so tacky it looks spread eagle’s on an outhouse wall! What was the message here? It seems to be against frieght trains. Trust me, don’t get me wrong, no real dweller of God would get on a train with someone who calls himself ‘PROPHET PROFIT’ as Jeb Hensley’s alter ego. That bum needs serious Prozac and therapy. Get a clue. These types of NAMBLA (NO-BUDGET AMATEURS) movies are the ones giving serious filmmakers a bad name. A hundred people probably paid $1 to watch this! No way this soul sucker is worth more than a buck! It’s more of a theft of a buck! That was the most fake looking explosion at the bottom of the train track! All in all this film is so phony that my dog would look at it and sense there’s gotta be something wrong with it… something very,very, very WRONG!! And then
beat a 70 year old sound guy to the pedestal. Or, the reality TV star that has become President. When I say that I have voted in the last 5 elections, I certainly do NOT mean politically as an American, I just mean that I've voted for TVs "American Idol" and "Dancing with the Stars." LOL. But....in all seriousness.....this is what I believe to be the ULTIMATE REALITY STAR! Now please don't let it be a DOLLY, (as I have begun to refer to girls who are obsessed with the Kardashians), if she is anything like most of them. LOL. I'm hoping to find one who is a real Christian woman, albeit, I know that's probably asking too much of a criminal who would have doxxed herself for (I'm assuming) money, and the spotlight if she were not a born again Christian. It's impossible to hide a bad heart, so I would hope that whoever she is, she will be a Christian. As always, I'll leave it completely up to the gentlemen to decide who they believe is the Prettiest of Them ALL! And, for the record, I hope she has found forgiveness from Jesus for her now past, misguided ways. Maybe I can convince her to tell me about all of her "
more enjoyment out of the bonus features on the DVD. I could sit and watch behind-the-scenes things for my favorite movies all day. There's just something special about getting to experience the magic of a movie from start to finish: actors creating their characters on film, and then seeing the magic of Hollywood hard at work to create elaborate sets, interesting costumes and other worldly props. Although I enjoyed the actual film (and probably because of this), I didn't find any of the short bonus features to be anything spectacular, and so did not edit any clips and choose my favorite moments for feature in this post.

including every degree of the hero being a moron, and deserving every success he gets. The fight scenes are marginally better than the cheesy attempts in anything from the 1980s, but Beach’s best fight scene is where he fights two huge guys who are agile enough to be singular far more often than they are mooks, because the script places them in totally inappropriate locations for a large group of fighting extras to be found. But these are compensated for by his fight scene against the skilled professional in the Namibian desert, where he shows his own skills, that are utterly absent everywhere else because they are unnecessary. That fight scene, compared to any of the ones in either of the S.W.A.T films, is at best equal, and more likely a lot better than even the best scenes in those films. Beach had some story to tell, but within the confines of a loose allegory (because Al, see Gran Torino, is one of the few sympathetic figures in the film), he makes a lead character I couldn’t work up any feeling for. Then there’s the ludicrous villain. Asian fixed-fight betfighting has been with us nearly as long as boxing movies. Drunken Boxing is a classic villainous set piece. Beach however uses a klatch of stuntmen all dressed in the same
-trilogy showed in a full version in Croatia for the first time. As a sequel to Louder than bombs (2015) and Queen Margot (1994) director presents characters caught up in the vortex of events in Europe. The events are recalibrated upon themselves in an intense story that rises and falls in a swirl of suspense and violence. Caught up in the vortex of the Middle East situation, the Romani from France and Eastern Europe are caught between their determination to stay put and keep to their own laws and the onslaught of everything that goes against them. Kilimandjaro (2018) provides a deep, almost philosophical analysis of moral and social laws — laws experienced as universal and identical, yet their long-standing strangeness to the Roma and their perceptive and written-out oppressions that translate into a justified and boiling dissatisfaction that rises from time to time in waves of violent attacks and murders. Kilimandjaro is a strong political statement, a reflection on the conflicting relations between gypsies and representatives of other ethnic groups and a survey of the foreign and easy-to-obtain but small-minded position of gadje in their relationship with Rom. Kilimandjaro is also a “time bomb” that makes the viewer almost experience mid-air
