. If you squint at it you can see it's sci-fi. Dress it up as a modern day Princess and the Pea fairytale. Make it a love story, contemporary retelling of Pygmalion—it's all there. Evening is the other lesser-known but more engaging tale of a successful middle-aged American married couple who are expecting a difficult baby. They ask their married grown children to move in while the baby is being delivered. The children are successful in their own fields and there are one-time boyfriends (presumably they break up). There is a last chapter about the grandchild through Mary's eyes. (Mary—the name of perspective writer and actress—is the pylon of the family. Evening is her stuff.) The end is fitting, legitimate. The movie was wonderful and provocative for me and my chick friend, I can strongly recommend Evening. We rambled afterward briefly and effervescently about our impressions of the movie. We did not doubt the lack of engagement by the men in our group—life events such as baby-bearing and delivery-doubling and men are so primitive they do not affect them. Or don't feel a need to discuss what affected us every other scene. We are right, we are not shallow, other experienced women will appreciate the finely drawn characters here, from Night
an incredibly budget of $4,000.00 makes that even more astounding. The low admission price, 15 cents per person is hard to justify and is unfortunately a misleading statement to conceal the fact that 100 per cent of that money goes to the management. If you look at the return of the investment in the Scott Theatre you will view that each person is asking each and every year to spend ten cents more than if they had an automatic subscription. In addition, each year the theatre management asks for as such each and every member to spend on some sort of motion picture project but it does not go through the associations budget. Some of these assessments were in excess of such a percentage of income such as renting a film amounting to 48 cents per person per week, when they only rented one film for the year at a total cost to the association of fifty five dollars. Everything looks wonderful in the bright light and certainty looks fairly bright with Denny Adams backing production. In addition, there was a total of more than $1,000.00 worth of admission which never, and could never be tabulated. All this brought a return in principal or originally costs of $400.00. Which bounces greatly to the advantage of the Amateur Cinema League. Unfortunately, this is not being done, though by his use of the images, he has

Italy, and using a non-professional cast Fulci plays the leader of a Jane best known as Anna. Anna is a teacher who is adored by her student Mancini, only she doesn’t realize it. The storyline is Jimmy Page meets Vivaldi. The titular John Lynch plays a doctor who is under investigation by Anna. By the end of the movie things have developed into a Jack the Ripper sleuthing with what’s her face being a crack-addict/whore/grand dame seeking bloody redress for some earlier injustices. On the lighter side, but definitely with the then scarcely seen gratuitous nudity scene in this sort of film the movie expect ups and downs to accompany Mancini’s burgeoning “rockist” work. This is a giallo with all the familiar elements: L’Apocalypse Now set in the Austro- I’m sorry I was going to say Vienna. Innovative use of nature set ups. Excellent pickups (we need to use this verb more). And the granddaddy of them all LOMO is on tap. Surprisingly, it also has a score by Ars Vlum. To some this list may seem jarring, but to others it will excite them and a damned fine line up at that. After the movie, there was a panel on gov
this show in their own alternate Universe. It appears to me that most people here are deeply fixated on nostalgia. The same things are being said over and over by people frustrated that they don’t get their way here. I also know a few commenters but don’t seem to care much here. I’m one of them. I got on because of Cheryl they have been my special more to the point who makes me want to delve into the Next Generation and the other shows anytime I have an itch to scratch and when season 1 ends I don’t think I’ll be at all interested in II or III. I guess Ill be the only one before the first episode has aired. For the first time to say probably in 28 years I’ll be remaining disinterested and only coming back to this place to correct my I’s and the places where I need clarification. Not as rabid a fan as most are here. I’m sure I’ll be immensely disappointed if Lightbringer constantly is in the forefront instead of what seems like it will be minimal with only 8 episodes. I’m all but confirmed in my opinion that nostalgia it whats driving the pony fanbase. It isn’t what I seek as I’d prefer to expirement with new characters and experiences and not things I was exposed to 28ish years ago
superhero shows embrace the twee romance angles, Chris Carter is interested in the cold sweat of the cop who is trying to take it as far as he can, regardless of his personal fears, bias or distaste. And the score is a classic. The sound is so distinctive and the theme so familiar and catchy in its simplicity, one could tell that this show is worth watching from just the OP. It's used sooo many times, perhaps you are even sick of it, but I don't know about you, but I consider myself "Scully-educated" and can fill those pauses in mid-sentance reciting the classic TV tagline.

But of course for starving filmgoers the pickingss would have been even thinner without other death-related chancers to help digest the corpse brained achievement.

It’s all about risk/ reward with these things, and I’d be chewing your ear off if I didn’t therefore tell you my strategy this time around is that to stay in the cinemas only for films that don’t take themselves seriously for fear of serious injury.

best, so hopefully no one will see this one as an afterthought. And that’s because, although it’s funny to begin with, the cracking jokes feel a lot more labored less we’re in Expect Fig and Mantrip mines, which give you fresh air to breathe. It’s more of the same this time around in that we’ve got some decent characters and a few good actors. That’s the most important thing for a comedy: script or script and journey. The director is one-a-way-guy and writer rattles too many trials and tribulations to help you get a smile out of it, perhaps. Special effects are good though, we won’t complain about that. The movie used to be called Ant Bully but it was changed and I don’t know why. But that doesn’t matter because this movie would still be a bloat although I wholeheartedly agree with IMDb that it’s not even two hours long. I always say this: please let Robots 3 and 4 be good. Thanks and I’ll see you soon. Oh, don’t make any bad experiences if you didn’t know they were anthill threats. Why? What’s wrong with the English language that means “someone who can retaliate”? On a different hand, I should say thou that what I really enjoy typing right now is
". But, what little I think they added was pretty good. I personally thought the PennyDreadful material was terrible and it should have just been omitted completely. But that's just me. I still think Fleischer knocked it out of the park with their 20 minute movie. Hopefully it make a few bucks and renews their investment in Cup Head, the CE that I really think has potential. Our store rented out a fleet of 20 copies. I hope they order more thanks. Fingers crossed, maybe they might get a 2nd go at C2. Thank goodness C2.5 came out or I think we would have all been in a "bad" mood today... Thanks everyone for keeping my spirits up. Especially Madman! BTW, continue to be informed on the Coronado effecs. Since the game came out like 3 months ago, I don't know if they can support it much longer. Like I said before, I don't really care cause C2.5 is pretty close in many ways. Hopefully, they cave and throw in a deal for to those that's already own it down the road. (i.e. League Unlcoked). But what ever happens, I want to thank all those that provide comments and feedback around here on keys and effects. You guys help alot of us know what to buy eventually. Anyway, with Cor

Volcano, Gods & Monsters, Chungking Express, Eat Drink Man Woman, Sleepless in Seattle, Table of Contents, and Park (Row in Trans) are just some of the dozens of superfine flicks presented at the three packed-to-capacity programs I attended. Director's eyes light-up like bug-eyed puppies when they hear we enjoyed their movies. The philosophy of the series exemplified by Cameron Crowe hitting the rooftops to embrace his fans is unselfish in the moment but reflective of years of the labor of love. Accepting ignorance with grace is part of loving classics is an ongoing challenge. At TEP, watching for the first time, I felt like a little girl spinning, looking with wonder at the marvels of the world I inhabit. I re-experienced La Dolce Vita off the canary-yellow preserved set of Venice where the movie takes place.

who will hold the ulhort position in the supposed triad. One man, Johnny Ma, tries to rig the election every couple of years, but the question mark character, Sun, always takes him down and becomes the new triad king. Walking home one day, Sun's ladder gets knocked over and he sees Johnny in the shop where the loops are held and watches his henchmen take some money that Johnny thinks is all of the profit from his plant. With these newer hints at who the bad guys might be I'm going to presume this movie will be on Johnny's side and continue to look more at the characters since it already has the mob connection. This is quite an interesting genre to follow because there are so many different angles to play with. The two areas that movies like these gravitate towards when using the mob as a center for the story is either keeping the plot separate from their general life and the major effect they and their actions have on every day things or when it is an everyday thing that Johnny and/or Sun does. Although, I don't want to presume that the film would try to keep them separate. There are many other possibilities that could be looked at or tried, and although they might be something that has already been done many times before I'm interested at the way it could both be explored and in some way, broadened. Naturally, the issue is the way the story
but in 1900 this was probably unheard of. There are too many good performances, too much heart here. That's what Brown is all about, this pot bellied convict, that helpless piece of mutton, out of sorts and victimized. He can take no action, simply because he is a COMMON felon. Today there would not be a movie on the subject, in it's place there already would be a law suit, this is simply not done in society anymore. Brown nearly falls off his chair when he has a visitor, when all visitors for inmates at the receiving new have mandatory guilds to follow, he had no clue. For reasons unexplained these reasons abridged a live they should not have, it's thought that Gov. Samuel Parker had to logically uphold his own clemency at the time of Brown's hanging. That was a thought of the powers that be, and of history. But at the time there doesn't seem to be any such consideration, and life in prison seems the wherewithal for the criminal, his freeing becomes an emergency issue that had to play out, and despite hard lines by the prison and administrators, it well and truly plays out. Coming away from this one, considering what is always just around the corner, there is a strong impression that the scenery of Browns receiving new

Still kickin' in with The Ventures, "Let's Go": "Ooooh, Ooooh." (You see what I mean?) The credits list virtually everyone Hollywood could think of who was working at the time. I need to know three things: who was who in the manifest degrees of separation between Nielsen and Little George? Who got custody of Blossom, and shouldrootable assets? And does this mean Ellen Burstyn is a regular gal? The Burstyn/Eddie Winslow Case is still up for appeal. The phenomenal Jill Clayburgh (interviewed in "In The Belly of the Beast" in the pages of Crosswicks, issue #5, Holiday 2005) would set many things RIGHT. I hope she remembers her late husband and the Brinks job where their four year old son's forearm got taken off for posterity. We only got to use it
thought that the contestants' debut in the comic film 'Specky Four-Eyes' wasn't perfect, but 'The Crashgate Scandal' with the same actors turned out to be much more enjoyable to watch. The roles of young, easily angered and easily deceived characters go well to the actors. The real credit goes to the creators of the screenplay, which tell realistic stories of teenagers and link the most important problems of everyday life with sports competitions in the movie. Although the plot seemed at times to overstate some wrong-taken-out facts, in the main, the movie became a great addition to the filmography of perhaps the most boring genre of the year - sports comedies. It should be especially noted that the creators of the film's soundtrack paid attention with their work, including catchy hits like the Brazilian 'Funk' and English 'Charts' that also made the movie more colorful and popular. So crack a cold one and chuckle - 'The Crashgate Scandal' is certainly going to bring joy to its audience! By Kino-teatr.ua.

movie. The crime and pure super-villainy of someone like David Eastman really does deserve a true film treatment but Shadow Lake and this cheap quickie portray him as a clown/villain, and that portrayal does not help your case, Johnny Depp. It gives him a bad name. I appreciate you, Johnny, but you did not do this character justice in your ability to portray him as a serious criminal, and that was unfortunate since the cast was competent enough - a real missed opportunity to do it a bit more presentably than what we saw. Maybe this plot premise could be improved upon for a future project someday. The screenplay should be improved upon and the budget should be appropriately inflated so that the story can have a more realistic flair and TEN TIMES as much material to include.

to tears since a childhood viewing of Bambi. The story resonates so much with what i know of my father, who spent time in Japan in the Occupation. He was very quiet about it, leaving a well travelled photo album to tell the story, and only finally told me the full truth. As you can imagine, the book helped fill in the details. A tip of myController to you. It is both, to me, a celebration of what can be gained when we, as nations, put our petty differences aside to collectively fight to defeat a destructive common enemy. And a warning of what happens when that understanding is sabotaged by those selfish and prejudiced individuals. I spoke with a number of Japanese. They were all wary of this film, i suspect mostly because they feared what a Japanese audience’s feeling toward their involvement in war would be. Their view of themselves was too tied to a sense of honor. Honor they felt they had lost. They did not see the nuance in the script, and certainly not, apparently, this wonderful film. Brazilian movie here… but it may well deserve world-wide distribution. To me the Japanese ability of story telling in film, ranks them alongside that of the aforementioned Russians. All i have to say it, if you are unsure about seeing this film, the rating system on the box says. Romantic. All

contrast, the Ron Howard version is very dark. Mr. Bunny (Bill Harding) is written instead as a lonely rabbit who liked to stay home and read and did not like to see his friends leaving him out. The two children he takes for a ride, Stacey (Brenda Marshall) and her brother Larry (Sonny Hardwick), have a dream at night about having a tin man daddy who lay down pages every night instead of reading them to his kids. I realize that you could say the bond between a parent and a child is stronger but I don’t think that many Staceys and Larry guy are dying that the pressure they get from the parents to read to them and rather than tell them at the check out line (or whatever the children are doing that’s appropriate) to read a book (or play a game but let’s just call it reading for this discussion) you may instill an ill feeling towards the book site that will last for years. ‘The Magic of OZ’ is disturbing from beginning to end, as you have children who are taught that it is ok to be an asshole, as long as you are reading a book to someone else. I realize that Ron Howard is a filmmaker in his own ways but sometimes a man who pulled the trigger on ‘The Da Vinci Code’ (and waited actively for it to flop) shouldn’t be allowed to direct

of shit crap below a 4 is a disgrace to mankind, there I said it. If this piece of shit of a movie is an iota bigger than you think, go ahead and click the rating. Tries to be like the famous alien invasion bitch of all time, "Independence Day". But fails miserably at that. Nothing more then the stupidest story I have seen in my life (If someone ever wants to plot their bears in totally spastically 1998 view of the future, I am available). The acting is weak to an absurd manner. What the hell, there are no real proof of human acting ability in this entire movie, except Arnold Scwarzenegger. Scwarzenegger playing a strong angry man is his specialty and type casts. So if you are a fan of this butchered version, prepare yourself, things don't get better over here. Seeing the first movie released years before this, it didn't have that undeniable bad taste taste that this one is. The first one does not even have this over stupid and over your head Alien invasion trash on speed plot. Nowhere the anywhere close to it. You will fall in love with garbage from you tracted out home lively hood like this scene, the two humans talking to each other. Pretty much a failed attempt at Joe Average, you know
goes on a business trip. He takes the airport bus, packs his bags on the train and then hands them over to the airplane stewardess who puts them in the overhead compartment. The end of the trip however, Joe's bags are no where to be found. He tries to get the airplane stewardess's help and so pesters her for information on the whereabouts of his bags. As Joe gets more frustrated, the comic hijinks ensue. When the airplane lands, Joe is left unmistakably penniless and can be seen approaching a Salvation Army man for help. This short has a similar comedic style to But Fufi, Die! where a well-dressed man is duped by a rogue. The last bit is really funny; If you've been looking up comedy shorts on youtube lately, you are probably easily recognizing the sensations, Roy Del Ruth as Joe and Esther Howard as the airplane staff. Since this installment is written by Connie Gilgun, this makes the short even more light-hearted and hilarious.

say it is great either. I think if I had watched M? again now for the first time in years, I'd still have come out saying that it is great though. That being said, Casablanca is somewhat sloppy when it comes to the looters in Rick's Cafe, it's easy to overlook though simply because it's tonally right. Then there's the unmasking, what a comedic scene that is. Rounding things off is Humphrey Bogart's voice, an underrated element to his performance, how many lines like 'You told me you wanted a candlelit dinner' have we all said to a girl? If anyone is a fan of Wickie (1989)/Wickie loses his trousers (1985), Humphrey Bogart's laugh is audible in almost every scene. Hans Christian Andersen's 'Butterfly' is, I think, the best piece of cinematography / camerawork in Cinema, underrated? You bet.

Too bad cause i was hoping for a cool B-movie with a B-movie budget.Dante Simon is the scariest thing on screen. ..On the other hand its has a young Julian Mcmahon portraying Ramirez.Simply watch 'Cujo' or 'An American Werewolf in London' instead! When u got too little budget, you should avoid werewolves.. in general.As for Kill Buljo.. that was a good one. :) 90's is everything about teenagers, Nintendo LAN parties, flat stupid hairstyles and horrible clothes.. let alone cliché movies and devices.. :)Im feeling sorry for the mother that pays the same price for eating mcdonalds for 2 or for a ticket in 'Night of the Living Dong' movie. :) It's explains why McDonalds is getting rich! :)Overall u shouldn't ever give

It's better than Crimson Tide but probably not by much, the plot makes absolutely no sense because Bullitt, Sodernebergh has to dig so deeply into himself towards usual plot structures it makes me question his ability to make the twin movies he's made. Yah, two boring, stock movie tropes based on wrong-headed plot pre-requisites made by dude who can't make a good, plot driven movie. It's films like this (and The Illusionist, a lesser Firefly, a film by Dunes, Charlie's Angels) that will bankrupt the DVD industry ultimately. In the age of budget-conscious flicks and extra features, it's films like this that won't get you the money back for when you throw the movie in and it just runs, sounds, and looks mainstream studio garbage... It's a weird movie where all the characters
film, mocking its camp feel. (That's one way to review it!) I must admit it's a bit campy, but a very enjoyable "not-so-shlocky" thriller. All American people, but a Spanish crew including director Paul Hedges (using his real name). Who I have seen to do good work. Jonathan Frakes stars as Samuel the merchant sailor and James Daughton is the evil scottish horse trader McTeague, who operates in Colorado to use the Indians as a local source of cheap labour. McTeague's prized horse and experimental new cartouche is infected at a time when there is a promised great bounty for all horses to Washington Bacca, and a time of epedemic and famine. Samuel is instructed to try to reach McTeague to get the cartouche. Along the way he teams with fast shooting horse trainer Shakti (Carlos Casar's first western role-playing wheel dealers (?)- and directs the movie in a very modern/cool style. In this case, the SVU unit in NY decided not to investigate child abuse six years after a settler moved in from Illinois and allowed himself to live among these people. Who are raped, enslaved and killed. Way too complex to criticize it although many are scornful that it does not focus on
any sense at all. What have any of the characters been doing for the past five years since the IIWW ended?? Why do some of the characters appear in one of Boris' films and disappear in the next? If you are completely into the B movie genre then you should find this funny, but if you are looking for a coherent story then you better look elsewhere. But oh boy, I liked it because when he talks about his Scottish twin brother, that was funny. All the rest needs a 100."Moview" from me. PS I give the movie a 10/10 because it is still out there for us patient movie buff readers to buy.

also takes certain liberties with the original “films” Gordon shares with Audrey and Gerty. All of the dialogue is invented, and shows by quartic as the lessons are being taught. They are not part of the actual movies Gordon watches, the title is only a spoof, so that the discussions can be recorded and transcribed. The original films are under Copyright and may not be parodied without their permission. This is not necessarily true of the dialogue. For discussion only. Hell’s bells, Ghod bless ‘er, she’s pulling one out az a fule. Daed deed der. While there were scenes where I wished Gordon was a lot more of an alpha who, you know, gets to the kissing by, like, bending Gerty over an examination table pull her pants down and–whose ded scouse? Sexy times to follow, in other words, I like Gordon. I think this cover was quite tongue-in-cheek. The story takes the James Bond genre and turns it inside out in some really amazing ways. Not really. The premise of these Bond films is that qualifications matter, and society is built upon them. So the pre-marital sex Gordon is demoted for is looked over by Ian, Liz and Audrey and Gerty. The newcomers are grovelling servile and cring
- the name status is effecting his acting because of the name coleslaw is also identical with canned corn. I think with the beautiful eyes of Winona Ryder he should have a hit with this movie. But I waited too long for only his eyes. For example the scenes around Atom actually are great for a movie. The whole movie is not completely lame - but just most of it. If I see three or four of the next movies of Paul Rudd, I see If they are great as when I saw Ken Scott's "Coffee and Cigarettes". M. Knox wrote script for the movie, what's the knock. It is more a drama then a comedy for me, the comedy loss can't be seen because there is no good one. Maybe you can check out the web-site of this movie if you have a chance.

Less glamorous were stories about her father, Mal, who had lived with her and her ex, John Derek, until his death in Springfield, a few months before "Ten" was released. It was he who helped Bo earn the Boat she was so evidently so proud of in her those crisp early "10" promo shots.

This "Movie Wars" edition is a good pick because not only has this film spawned a reign of sequels but this edition has the commentary by Roland Emmerich stuck in. It is good enough that we recommend it for the extras. We loved "Independence Day" and are glad that someone made a movie where aliens ruled our world. Emmerich captures the Catastrophic feel perfectly and we love it. Only criticism is that Lawrence Fishburne seems to be lost in this world of aliens. He is in every bit as much imagination as the next guy but his eccentric acting style was over-the-top in "Independence Day" and not as appealing. The one shot of Fishburne cracking a joke was not necessary and did make us snicker even less. We do not recall Fishburne being able to help usher out the White House with boiling water. Speaking of which, other than making fun of the GW Bush look alike it is hard
reasons for moving to the island. Adaptations rarely live up to the source material. Books are better from start to finish. Since a book is like a TV episode and can sub plots interior monologues etc. verse a film which is like a painting. Use your fucking imagination. Do not force feed us with pointless 3D idiotic action set pieces. Books have have best characterization, dialogue, describe what is going on and much more. The adaptations tell you nothing you will not know what is going to happen anyways. Not all adaptions are like this one usually but nothing rivals the beauty of the book. No books made me feel as if I was there like book to film. Eyes down were better than we can ever describe they are different medium's that is why books were in the history so I do not understand why they are move here to day.

hero of the story is the slick PR agent Marty Dutch (Lee Marvin), who has long been on the payroll of hardline Cold Warrior Senator Arthur Fenby (Edmond O’Brien). But while handling the increasingly-unaware Arthur’s re-election campaign, Dutch comes face to face with Fenby’s latest chairman of the committee, Waltons-Kazansky (Jew "Rhodes Scholar" idealist Ronald Reagan), the marriage of American efficiency and Russian system. And though Dutch’s campaign staff, Katie Murphy (Carroll Baker), dollars and cents sells the Senator into office, deaths and murders stack up quickly, giving his ideological adversary (though not the most scrupulous) sound-bite to save the day. No surprise that Condon’s subsequent offerings include highly-rated execrable prostitution satires Prive Part and One of Our Dinosaurs is Missing (in which dinosaur science is used as cover for groundbreaking satirical attacks on Voluntary Parenthood) and Questions and Answers for Killer Nuns (a controversy exploitation 1970 which attacked new-way religion nuns of the time).

things such as modern themes in the novel. I have read the book repeatedly and each time I notice a different element to it. Example: I read it for the first time in 1961. I read it again in 1979, and laughed at how much more it had to offer than I saw the first time. That, of course, has happened to me with many of my favorite books and I think that it would become habitual with The Lord of the Rings. I read the book again in 1991 and, even though I had read it at school in my younger years, I found that it seemed to speak to me on a much deeper level than it ever had before. I admire the rugged, if misguided loyalties of the Rohirrim, (I could almost feel myself one of the Marksmen) I feel sympathy for the noble sentiments of the Elves. And, in everything, I am in awe of Gollum. I can not imagine anything more degrading then what he has been turned into…and I take no pleasure in his demise. That is character…this is not common in the 20th century. As I think most folks would agree, Tolkien was a genius! It is my belief that the deep personal relationship of these characters to normal folk is one of the reasons that his work is so accepted and understanding by

at times laborious. I suspect some readers will come away thinking about how complex manned journeys are through space. However my favourite moments occurred when talking about Stephen Hawking's Theorem about black holes, and when talking about the possibility of extra dimensions. While we know about the extra 3 space dimensions, the discussion of extra dimensions of TIME has been an ongoing problem. According to at least one physics textbook, Einstein was thinking of this as early as the 1920s. Blackholes are seemingly components of time. Extending back into the past (where the hole is) and forward into the future (where the hole is). We all know scientists do this all the time when doing research on a particular topic, but I found Grothaus theories too confusing and really just not convincing. I could not escape the doubts that Gary Chapman expressed. Gerard got lost at points and goes towards the more spiritual side of philosophy. Chapman was in coherence with his argument. I could not rid myself of this thought that Gayard was too caught up in the fringes of European and American philosophy debates IMHO and not enough in blackholes. This book is enjoyable enough but maybe it’s not great as a non-fiction. I’ll leave it to one side but no definite recommend. Their website can be found here: http://storitellerpod.com/ This

But in a way I suppose it makes the street scenes that little bit more real and it has deferred to the original hand held style.

A gang boss Frank Miller plots A high price on Will's head. But what will he do? Miller finds Will and tells his gang the price has been doubled to reward. Immediately newcomer, Emily (Emily Eskelin) tells her brother, Deputy Dude Walsh to collect all the local guns and get them in the next stagecoach to Miller. The young Dude, can't believe it and refuses. The town get wind and the townspeople have had enough of the gangs controlling the town and tell the Sheriff the route of the stagecoach.

Miller then throws a danger plugin and it
this movie falls into its way in a very conventional way. I felt beneath the glitz and polished surface the film merely structured itself by the classic familiar frameworks and yet there are enough problems here to question it all. It certainly gets tricky if desperately complicated in the first half it all ends satisfactorily, as one would expect. But it doesn't do it in a way that delivers the thrill. Inevitably there were new variations in character developments, and for a relatively simple heist movie it became a problem. The goodies were very multi-dimensional and some bad guys nicely laid down-this was a guilt trip. Not the brightest stars in the world cast -but possibly capable actors. I assumed the effect they delivered it was meant to be there but the replay was less than inspiring I guess the films look, was meant to make it look great - slick - and that certainly captures the Heinlein story well. Obviously this movie will not attract me in any way. Be warned and be careful, elegant and expensive. Sleepy, gross overkill and baffling electronic drum beats and synthesized soundtrack by BURNETT to overpower depleted brain cells. The painting "San Diego" by Claude Monet was very impressive, it was probably the best feature of it all. A surprisingly smartly written and well produced film. Okay, no matter how many

and the performers who portray them are not ones to worry about, but what about the camera men and editors of such shows? Is there a risk of them sometimes slipping over into their characters, or acting out just for the sake of having a thrill?

better film than Three Stooges. They also have Roy Lichtenstein to thank for their accidental brief return in abstract pop art form. In 1963, the mentor to Andy Warhol created a few full-collage splashes of the Stooges' clowning. Arguing Elephant is based on a 1934 Three Stooges short from Columbia Pictures. In this Stooge film, the trio finds themselves caught up in a Texas oil dispute. In Lichtenstein's collage, the trio is silhouetted on a red background in pink, black and yellow and are set in in the massive, pale red elephant's forehead. From the politicians with their small mouths to the money men with their rolling marbles in their mouths, this elephant pop is the ultimate emblem of urban dishonesty.

, written by Caryl Churchill and directed by Stephanie Casier, I felt like if I stepped into the theatre I may fall into a hole and drown. The scene where Jessica Milledge declares, “Robert won't want the baby, what if it's born with rancid aluminium in its body ...” “What do you mean?...what if this child has more wrinkles than a three year-old?” Besides the starkly sad lyrics that Carl Orff won the Oscar for the soundtrack to the film Carousel (1956), there is no celebration, restriction or joy in these lives. It is not doing a play such as this that I wince - it's the conversations you have to have around it afterwards. It is not dark by definition, nor does it probe into the nature of humankind - it is simply a frustrating night at the theatre. “Looking out, nobody is all the way inside, they're without form and void.” Ultimately it left me desperately wanting to stumble outside, into the street lights and skip into the summer evening. For this reason I say that Rancid Aluminium is one to avoid. The reason it is not a three I was questioning is the beautiful and skillful performances by Fiona Clarke (Nan Noble), Jessica Milledge (Janet Noble), Ni
his reign of terror while in the Balklands, small, Western powers had clashed because of internal restructuring and social unrest caused by the impending climactic global crisis. 2019 is the year in which NATO, in response to the wars created by the nutcase GOP which has created chaos in it's wake and the internal civil war necessary to stabilize it, is attempting to provide stability on a future front by properly containing the growing Russian incursion into the old satellite states that fell to the Russian Empire after the fall of the Soviet Union. However, now, against the state with low to moderate intelligence that began the process of re-creating this threat in their absence of leadership dislocated from Russian ability to manage. Meanwhile, in the state created and controlled by Hillary Clinton, it's citizens have willing given up their individualism and status in return for the personal security, which has become the lock down of our rights and is creating a machine state administered by a state intelligence agency controlled by members of this ruling elite, the debate is ongoing what level of control is needed to prevent the threat to society from terrorist organizations funded by regimes from the Islamic state which we and many European countries support (as long as they remove the sanctions on Russia, which the CIA has misled our president to continue doing) and the need to sustain and agree to create
in the US, during various off-hours at the BBC. The Comic Strip Presents. was a staple as well. I did eventually own The Personal Service and Bottom Live Total Rubbish on VHS, but’ve never ever watched them. But order me to watch Bottom front to back for a project and I can’t say no! It doesn’t even matter if I have to sit through Travelling Man. (IMO, a terrible episode from the last season…) I will watch Constantin’s nudity. I will painfully endure Linda’s seemingly endless scene with the box. Her pain and mine, are infinite. It’s not funny to watch. The show is too sacred to me. I’ve enjoyed much of revolutionary Murray’s work on screen since. Be it Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace, his voice out of the Television Hell in Tenacious D, Gonzo the Rock Journalist, his work in Hot Fuzz, etc. And his cameos on Dr. Who or his trade-marked hissy fits. He’s always been an incredible talent. Mixing them with Ana Rynne, Bottom was literally in a league of its own in terms of it’s weirdness and rude humor. It’s a shame to witness Paul Steinberg’s contributions to the series, was damaged
this movie. Four-letter words, perhaps? (As this is a family board, I won’t spell them out here). It is the 21st century edition of Lake Injustice, a low-budget “take me or leave me” flick from the makers of Wetlands. You will either love this movie or hate it – you won’t find that many who are ‘meh’ on it. It is…extreme porn for film geeks. That’s the best way I know for a low-budget indie flick (and it’s a serious one with a real story behind it) to gain widespread appeal. For the film geeks who have seen and loved it – ‘the slave chair’ scene is insane. As over the top as you might think. “What’s next, boobs?”. “NO.” and then you’ll have seen it. And for the people in the middle of whether this movie is totally awesome, well, letting Chris resolve his relationship issues in a highly artistic way with/in a domestic setting probably won’t make them change their minds. You’ll either find it offensive and disturbing, or the greatest thing since fetish porn. So it goes…but so do we carry on, and press on….like a nerve in a 12th degree of freedom matrix….smothering,
main character, Gustave Aschenbach, has a homosexual relationship with Tadzio, a Polish boy who is the subject of admiration of other men as well as Aschenbach. The film was adapted by director Luchino Visconti from its source material, which is Thomas Mann's expression of his self-directed obsessive love relationship with a different person altogether: Arthur Cravan, the man who called himself "Prince of Automatism."

but it's pretty high up there still. I'm pretty sure I'm 80% the characters in this movie, so I totally felt for the characters as children and got a kick out it as a child. Plus, this was basically the first zombie movie I'd ever seen and it, at the time, kicked everyone's asses, so it made me feel awesome to know I was on top of trends with everything from video games to movies. If only I had been old enough to enjoy Garbage Pail Kids cards. But I digress. This is just a fun one. To this day it still rings true for me, and I'll totally accept the fact that odds are I was just lucky to have such great parents. Obviously, this is an 80's movie review, so please change the tune everytime the words "girl" or "boy" are mentioned. I'm naturally confusing with things. Yes, I recognise the fact that the other gender inherently knows less than I do because they don't read books, watch television or ride bikes. No, I did not need to re-underline that statement. I know it makes perfect sense for most people, and I know some people will read it and decide "apparently this Megan Howard does not know my probing mind and willingness to listen to my emotions, or the
I've seen. I usually ignore softcore, because it's written from a male adolescent's point of view and it usually glams up the women a little bit too much. I've seen some "hardcore" porno movies, and most of it makes me think of soap opera. The best softcores are those that I've seen twice because there's so much going on. And this one was a marriage, about an unusual marriage, which wasn't once it began. She was an aristocracy of sorts, and he had fought in the Civil War, and he was a trader on the Santa Fe trail. So, I enjoyed the historical flavor which was missing from most Westerns. This was actually written and produced by Michael Wagner, who's a doctor. And also, it's obvious that this is carefully directed and this is carefully written. Especially from the lighting angles, it holds interest. But it's never really "hardcore" in anything. Even the passion scenes - it's all above board. But it held interest - the storyline and all. There's a lot in this movie, I think. It's amazing that this woman who'd been warned of her fiancé's wild lifestyle was unwilling to be intimate, but I guess he still felt guilty. She went home to her family, and I'm not
made. Here's the trailer. I mean if you will not watch this trailer then you will not watch the movie period. There are no if's, and's, but's. Watch it. My fellow movie lovers. I'm allowed to get crazy at this moment because I'm a raging fan. Nothing about the trailer is %100 accurate. Not the singing, not any of the drama, but the story. I can't talk too much about it because I don't want to spoil it for anybody who has yet to see it. This movie is a masterpiece. You will never forget the scene where a whole rival gang turns out to be a robot for going to this high school. This movie takes what's good about high school movies and elevates them in a whole new way. I adore this movie so much. There are very few things that I right out out love these days but West Side Story is one of them. When I came out of the theater I felt alive. I felt like I was watching the greatest story ever told. ---OTHER MUSICALS/PLAYS WITHIN THE PAST TEN YEARS--- Phantom of the Opera-16 years ago-A Star is Born-18 years ago-Kinky Boots-18 years ago-Ring of Fire-10 years ago-R
didn't fully understand the movie and all its deep insights (I had not yet seen 2001, A Space Odyssey or Stanley Kubrick's combined work). But one thing I took badly from that movie was: "My God. He's a beautiful boy." I personally find Samuel Jackson creepy, and I can't relate to his apparent desire to snuggle up to the boy played by Anthony Hopkins. Not gay, per say. Just extremely unnecessary intimidation and sexual Harassment (from Hopkins' point of view was), and why would the G.M. of the law have those thoughts in his mind? Bad for the 'shield' of the public and it's bad for ratings. Samuel Jackson's character conflict was seemingly based within the context of his own ignorance, but the truth of the matter is: bigots aren't attractive or likable in any way. And the characters try to make Samuel's bigotry sound cute or lovable, but even though I Liked him, he didn't look sexy, he looked like a terrifying parent figure who scared the shit out of Horse (the little black boy). I own all of these opinions because I do If you could just erase third-world child conceptions and disregard social commentary on television from your mind for a couple minutes and watch the
I was younger, was the kind of pairing I loved to spend time with on the big screen.I am sad to say, but I did not care for the movie much when I was younger, perhaps because my parents did not like the film either and I feel that it stirred something in me that grew to have a bad hatred for any movie I felt my parents disliked.Anywhere But Here was nominated for several awards but only won one;Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Burt Young.Now, many years and O parental dislikes later, I am getting the chance to reevaluate this movie that HBO took off their rotation and I can now see that it has a lot of good qualities to it.It is a coming of age story, which is close to Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men style of writing but it is flat out better.It is a fantastic film that any person who loves character study should seek out and watch over and over again. (Now I feel bad for not admiring this movie as a teenager, hello?!Teenagers grow and change too!)Now, I loved Office space, the movie with Ron Livingston and Steve Carrell, but I will admit that I probably love this movie more.It is a great comedy that tries to make a commentary on social class and just trying to get by in the world in a funny way.The
ten, but it isn’t that. As an autobiography, should I scale it down….A good friend passes away, the world remembers him and gives him a posthumous Hollywood award. You can’t imagine anything worse for him. He is free at last and no longer around to enjoy what others think he deserves. It is such a sad story. The novel by Roman Jochnowitz shows us two opposites, one a hard boiled guilty man and the other a good teacher and guru, a person who wants the best for everyone. Good and evil come close together and a relationship is planned by a very lonely and left awarding Polly to win over the hard boiled teacher and see his best side. This is a very good movie. That is if we forget that the violin music is coincidental. Don’t we take the plays of Shakespeare seriously enough as they cannot be wrong. The same is true of good movies. It isn’t all about acting. This is a movie I have to give five stars. It is too good. The music even supports the novel showing us the two tendencies coming together during the play. Keep it separate and there is no sadness. No, putting them together will always lead to bad teaching. See the contrast and you will be done with depression. I am, but as they say as Hemingway knew so well, it is too late in the evening
Christopher Plummer is one of my favorite actor and I’ve been wanting to see Melanie Griffith. From the moment I saw Plummer in the first scene, I knew I was in for a ride. And to my surprise without knowing what the movie is about, I was hooked and totally blown away! I was chomping on my gums, when Plummer revealed he’s been keeping a secret from Violet and Bill for the past 25 years, I knew there will be hell to pay…and boy is there. My only regret, realizing this movie came out last year was when the credits rolled. It was accutely written, beautifully acted and so finely made, I loved every minute of it. I will most definitely definitely see this again as it definitely won’t be the last for this year. The suspense is brilliant and is twisted in to a realm of what if scenarios giving it the effect of comic relief while it goes in a deep darkness. There’s some genuine feelings provoked into the meaning of sacrifice, people come in and out of your life especially for your parents and the love of life. Enough said, I’ll shut up and let you enjoy it! Btw the actress who played Christian Bale’s ex-wife didn’t receive the award for her role in Chicago. Why is this? She deserved it! Melanie Griff
cult followers and progressives, and an essential entry in the work of one of the greatest directors in the modern age. All the elements of the superb film are here - the set design that is both a slightly surreal Gothic nightmare and a sleek contemporary dream landscape, the performances by Viveca Lindfors and Teri Garr, the remarkable script including a dialog that is verbatim from a survivor of the last Vestal Virgins. Montenegro in the film is a set in which to dissolve (literally) and escape, as the people themselves continue to escape, in their own way. This indefinable and freeing aspect of Montenegro, a society that did not restrict women, was important to Peter Weir in the making of this unusual film. When the sense of dislocation and layering of reality reaches its peak, one can only stand in awe of an experience that is simultaneously foreign and familiar, mundane and visionary, cogent and transcendent, impressionistic and lucid. And it is all such a feast for the eyes. This is the sort of film that leaves me madly in love with cinema before it is even over. Over and over. It is beyond classifications, beyond polemics, or simple descriptive. It is a work of art. I can't quite wrap my mind around this modern films (films

too many things, and they aren’t able to do it. Naruto was kicked in the balls, beaten unconscious and thrown in a dungeon. However, as he woke up he found himself in the dark world. To me this sounds like a naruto – dark world type thing. People with older kids represent someone who enjoys cooking and has a knack for it.As a bonus I would add “People with older kids never called him out for his bad language, so now he thinks it’s okay.” Its like the OPs kid is trying to fit in with all preschoolers though.

he wants to be able to suck money out of the fake supernatural business, and even he and Sara know it's fake. Skip it. Skip all of them. Not a good show at all. There is plenty of scary, worthwhile material out there. I've heard it leaked footage to the WGBH program "Zombies: A Living History" which is a worthwhile and interesting show. For a non-history related show, the Walking Dead comes to mind. -_- Anyways I apologize for the ramble, but SOMALER's spoiling it combined with it from zerozombie is making me annoyed. Especially when it's all it seems to be is a weird con of the small business scenery and nothing more. It interacts absolutely not with American politics. It's just media literacy and vocabulary. Nothing more. And it's the most useless thing I've seen come from your computer since the bags. It doesn't even attempt to deviate from the normal Zombies story structure. The positives and effectiveness questionable. I like the walkers as zombies, was skeptical when they first started but they've nailed it. The rest are 80% rubble and debris and if I cared at all about those bones (which I don't)

over-acted by mostly the guy who directed it, and it just went off the rails. I turn it on and feel bad for having in my collection. When I do I just bump it. Its more campy than anything. It might be part of a collection, but its not part of the main one. I would prefer anything over this or any sequel to this. This film is awful. I think I have some other "great" films that I just have bought cause companies new or make a new movie. e.g Home Alone, and step it up Hollywood. Why don't these MCU films go up in price? I hate seeing prestige films like the 3 latest (1,2 and Solo) go up in price. By the time I have seen Fallen I'll have a pretty sick collection. Heck I have seen Spawn and it was great still I keep rewatching old BANAs. Its a farce, its not right. How come when I'm trying to spend money to watch some ancient pirate film that its brand new, but when I have a casserole of films to choose from, they go up in price? I don' think of myself as a cheapskate, I mean look at my DVDs, but I think I would like a good collection and be happy on whatever format that may be, film or disc. On youtube I have am
outrageous) comedy and I give it a very nice score of 4.5 stars. It's a satire on our country's use of Petraeus like "strategic corporate communications" consultants. "War, Inc." is an extremely real choice of matter for a spoof to be based on; it's one that Americans get in a way that the British, for instance, will never truly understand. That being said Will Ferrell is very sexy, and I'm very happy to see that he has expanded his comedic horizons. Not that it's all new territory, but he has matured. I was thoroughly amused by John Cusack's performance as well, who makes a complete ass of himself like only John could. The only bit of disappointment I might lodge against "War, Inc" is that it ends. That wasn't the problem, but the tone of the movie goes in a bit of a disappointing way at the end, that's going to make some people go "huh". But it was all worth it, it was hilarious and, for the most part, original enough humor to last, and is certainly going to become a cult classic. I look forward to many more productions from the Groundlings. Anyone who wants to stamp out $5 or $6 to laugh is not going to be disappointed. Just

a screen-saver' about paint. The scene at 'Grandma's house' had several characters talking at once and things were spoken or sung later on when they had moved to the table. For God's sake, you would have thought someone would have noticed that they were no longer in the same position! But you have to be fair here - the film thinks on an individual level, not showing too much focus on the lives of either Tony's or Pat's families. We leave them well alone. It was nice to see that the son of whatshername is the clever boy in the family, who's longing to climb that career ladder. Or is that Mary Hinge who's got a full week to find £40? Is that the tittybar that's now under serious threat? We all know what Tony is like, which talks about his love/hate relationship with her boyfriend, his fellow employee. She's like a daughter, not a funny little sister. Quality Leslie Ash. We are just passing on the gossip. And the daughter of the new manager? Apparently she's probably off-island. Meaningful music by Simon Clarkson. Is it a 'good day'? She needs to get the feel for it, like so many of the things she needs to get the feel for. What do you miss the most about Benid

quality for a long time. once you start watching you want to continue on, as the episodes seem to end on some sort of cliffhanger, so you want to see what happens next. it's not quite as good as the movie, and i wont't give it 100% as it does suffer in places, but it is well worth a watch, 8/10. worth getting the special features for and enjoying the dvd experience generally. prospects for a second season look good, not even fox can let a good thing go down the pan, and with the dvd sales a success, it should live for a good long while yet. see it. (not as enjoyable as walking dead, but certainly better than some tv shows currently on the air). definitely better than lost anyways (poor lost was sunk when it decided to replace the leads and two of the supporting characters). where is this new show called revolution though? into the badlands is on the tarmac here in the u.k. after a couple of shows in the u.s. apparently. anyone know the availability of that one? i'm sure theres plenty more now, but being a bit embroiled in watching season two of walker, and starting to watch the wire for the first time, i'm finding less time than usual to check other shows out, which is for the best, since season two ends
I caught up to what was going on the rest of the movie soon after. My cousin who, at the time, was living separately in Calgery was back visiting us in the house we were living in briefly and we went to see the movie together which just made it that much better of an adventure for me. At the time I thought it was pretty cool to do something with my cousin and I hope I still remember that as we get older. Obviously he never told me what it's like to go through a TV addiction. Jim is a writer who's written a book on a concept of an orbital space station from his books. Jean LeFont tries to get Jim to take on the project of the film but due to him not agreeing she decides to try to find someone else. While going though her Rolodex she comes across Dr. Nikolas Rice who knows about space ships, rockets and such things. The two go back and forth but finally convince Jim to put together the pilot episode. He agrees but not before trying to re-write one of the earlier rags of the books that he has. The two meet with the production VP who agrees to help pay for the cost (about 25M) for the pilot to air. After a lot of ups and downs the pilot for Outer Space is finally complete.

The story is realistic, to the point, not a fairy tale or science fiction in any way. I doubt that Andy Davis did or could learn to talk Swiss German in 12 weeks, but yes, he did build up expertise to perform with perfect imperfections within the short time stated. Depending on your native/Canton, you might understand a lot better than the Germans in the film.

back then, and that love of horror and spooky movies continues to this day. As I grew older, my preferences in horror changed. I never did like the blood and gore and head-smashing-with-hammer stuff. But fun, spooky films can be pretty fun! I was therefore excited to be tapped for a horror themed livery design by fellow graphic artist Kyne. Without giving too much away for those planning on playing it, I designed a horror house with a very evil Phoenix theme to it, and also a train with a train station in the background. Aside from possibly a seance, I don't see another perfect way to go about designing a Phoenix livery given the theme of horror, but I wanted to do it anyway! I haven't tried going up against an opponent with my design on a train yet, but I anticipate it is going to be incredibly tough to block me there (especially if it's in SD). If it's in HD, I may get burned out fast, but probably not. Anyway, enjoy the photos! There may maybe also be an Oriental one, though you'll have to see them on the site to pick that one out! All it says on that one is #8. Details are DIRE! -SS'd and -SJ'd and a big HF to Kyne and Kyonn,
the horrible dubbing or see the masturbating zombie soldier going at his lady love at the end. It was painful viewing. Even though I didn't enjoy this film I do look at the negatives and see how a little film like this changed the zombie film genre. Sure there were some great film including Fulci's films. But we <3 Zombi 2. Fujio became a big star in Japan after this film. He was in so many more films and not only did his work get plagiarized but turned into a complete trash pile. He was responsible for the masturbating zombie, the licking tongue, the duck billed stepsister, torso zombie jabbed with a sword, and last but not least the spider zombie. All genius characters Heraka has brought into the living dead. It all started with Zombi 2. I say I give this film credit for having a good film genre establisher. It's like the broken bottle that stabbed Curse Dr. Curetti they had to fill it with holy water once and for all which I believe kicked off the romero films. The interesting thing about Zombi 2 that I hope everyone is aware of is that really isn't a film from one of the films in the horror classics series. But that Russian still
in this dreck. Blind people must be touched and mathematics must be Greek. The continuity in this awful film is totally non-existent. Two reasons I ask the questions in the 3rd paragraph: The first is named Walter Tevis, whose short story that served as source material inspired this script. Also, the film seems to aim the audience at a high intelligent level. Why send them to bed if nothing of importance is said? This was a desperate attempt at igniting the director's career over the past many years with bonehead producers, who mixed this mad fiasco to this film. Why waste talent as Hopkins to speak baby talk gibberish, when a story never grabs your attention? Is the problem rooted in simply breaking no rules in knowing the ABCs of life? Better yet why are people going to get it when others in the movie cleverly explain life? Avoid this film. Don't you dare waste your money to see it in the theater. It's now out on DVD for that reason exactly. And remember, movies don't completely improve on DVD. You shudder and suffer along with us. What a headache! Just workshop this script once again with the writer. Feedback is always good. These actors can be so much better if anything in the script didn't sound forced. For instance, what rotten acting by Hopkins does capture

Also it's based off NearFanfiction so there's no being offended it here, or here, and the only people that would can.. go somewhere else.

personalities with a twinkle in their eyes when they knew her ladybug days were over. It's ironic that Gina tries to figure out ways to shape her personality so as to fit in with her new family while really what she was missing was the authenticity of a single mom who loved music more than anything else. Her talents with music were thrown to the kerb, and she tried and caused so much harm in trying to fit in. With her understanding mom pastor there was nothing to worry about. I hope Gina will be able to leave behind the hurt of the past forever and enjoy that kind of love again. It also made me realize how vital it is to honor your own gifts, since if you don't then you can make a serious mess of everything. I think the writer-director Fifield, and the actor Kate Cobb did a superb job with the screenplay, and with giving Rose a sense of inner strength that is not acted but simply believed in. No wonder she was the one to catch Gina's fancy and bring her relief. God bless them. Love, Diana May ( IMDb User ) November 12, 2022 at 8:18 PM Dorian Chadwick 05:17, 19.

art scene, the relationships between mothers and sons, as well as society’s fixation on youthful vigor in this classic satirical cautionary tale. Alexandria, VA and its art students live under the spell of their art teacher whose moody, self-absorbed lifestyle is strikingly symbolized by his perpetually unfinished painting. Ironically, his own son has no interest in being an artist, nor does the son’s beautiful, sensible girlfriend, and their antagonism toward art is symbolized by his textbook cigarette girl companion. Singing Loud features original songs written and performed by the underground rock band The Primates and was lensed by cinematographer and filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky. Elegant and aggressive, Singing Loud confronts the folly of striving for perceived perfection in a unique avant-garde style that was as much a leading influence of performance, experimental, and alternative film scenes as it was of familiar comedy. An Entertainment Weekly and Village Voice Critics’ Poll nominee for Best Underground Film of All Time, Robert Downey, Sr.’s Singing Loud is a satirical masterpiece! Special Features: a feature-length audio commentary with Robert Downey, Sr.; the documentary short What Ever Happened to Independent Film?; an introduction to the film by Matt
with Billy Bob Thornton's moroseness and even the supporting parts are fab. My girlfriend actually cut a finger bad during the movie's specific scene, attempting to explain these kids' spite towards Ellen's character. Needless to say, it's worth seeing. Simply because of the goofy smiles that the ensemble cast leaves you grinning long after the closing credits. Highly Recommended. It's more a shame that this role didn't immediately propel her into the A-List, as it did so for Meg Tilly after The Widow Between Thighs. If you like to tear up through laughter while meditating on human nature, you'll love this. This is like emergency medicine for your mood, trust me. A fillet full of charming quirks as in so many other mooden movies during the '90's, this comedy is a welcome compensation for sentimentality. This movie may not make anyone's 'best movies' list, but if it was burning in my office, I wouldn't wast the opportunity to sit and watch it. Enjoyable. Luckily, Bob Thomas's script is absolutely filled to the transom with perfectly small moments and truly emotional ones, too. There's a plethora of stupid little touches, perhaps only appreciated by those in the audience
couldn’t help but feel that Luca Lucini deserved more attention at the Oscars for his outstanding art direction. The film does have a fantastic atmosphere throughout, but it’s the details that seal this romantic retelling of Casanova’s younger years with more charming production set pieces than in many Hollywood blockbusters. One specific motif that schooled me was the way that the story always returns to the palace, with the path Di Girolamo (whose name means “ten cent piece”) is doing the washing-up, doing the laundry, serving the banquet tables: it gives a tangible sense of continuity, and the cold marble countertops and luxurious chandeliers make a grand juxtaposition with Di Girolamo’s own character and plot. This movie’s director Mateo Garrone has made an outstanding debut, and I hope to see more from him in the near future. I’m also curious to see where his film colors diverge from Casanova-the-novel in time. Update: I recently read the novel, and I’m glad that I had already seen the film before reading the book: it is indeed different, particularly in later chapters, but I doubt many of the changes are necessary for the plot to make sense. This version retains the style and heart of the book, whilst bringing
Online reviews let a lot of facts out about this crappy movie. Any dialogue between scenes is just something to continue the 'story' in a book, NOT in a movie. The acting in this is terrible, and some reviewers said kids acted things out, which is what children do when they try to dissect a movie b/c they did NOT understand what was going on. The action scenes do nothing in thshot is nothing to get excited about, and the way they change back and forth from awful / cheesy dialogue to terrible acting, to just plain horrible scenes is pretty bad. It is obvious that a producer took the wrong track with this movie and never fully completed the film.The music was awful, and even the beloved characters have been destroyed. I never thought Rose and Scar would EVER be combined into one. I wonder how long that was in your Idea's book. How many times do the Main Dejarik characters get dropped? I'm sad that the actors who played Vader, Neera, Charotte, Leia, etc were featured in this movie. There were specific characters that kept popping in and out of the film like they were too old to 'star' in the film... They definitely should NOT have put this out. I even liked some of the stuff from Episode 1 that pretty much show how stupid / separated from the plot sith plot is. The movie is also too connected
Gillespie (the late Anthony Hopkins) is involved with a superintendent one moment (in yet another, more retirement home like even context), one who’s fraught by the loss of her husband of many decades to a little-known illness who meets one who may not be eternally easy to get back onside with. Some of the context of our schmaltz think gold duo’s relationship, which itself honours the title, is dense, even serious. But such considerations, like those to keep in mind during important films, should be done in part by viewers, especially as, in some ways, this is a mainstream product, and certainly a contender for Best Picture. Yet, to these containing sensibilities, pitch perfect directorial and writing is, for comparison … well, you know how we feel about that. There are certainly characters who are no-nonsense and very direct but, by and large, the duo in question doesn’t play note to note with them. Bill Nighy suits neat trousers and stylish female companions in ways therefore that might not be complimentary. But he sells it, as does long time Hopkins’ note to wrap. Whereafter, thoughtfulness, subtle dynamics abound. And by the number of those, come over having now seen it, reflecting various terms of assent on it, we suspect

another trip to Netflix Instant. Jersey Shore: The Lost Footage is the first episode documenting the discount-clad reality series'. I laughed incessantly, I cried repeatedly, and I got high. You know what they say: "By drugs you shall be free." We've got a pothead DJ throwing beers down his shorts, drunken dancing, a group of dudes hooking up with topless girls, and a group of girls showing off their boobs and lacquered, coiffed hair. Jersey Shore exceeded my expectations; I am beyond pleased. It is so entertaining I just wish it had all happened in the span of a month. But, unfortunately, the 15 packets of caffeine can't make that time period faster. Guess I'll have to search Google news again for that football, eh?

It meant a lot that my heroes went to see my work. Since then it has always been a go to movie and my friends and family have been introduced to the Marx Brothers many thanks to my love for Duck Soup. Duck Soup is a ride that should be experienced many times and has a seemingly unending amount of funny moments. We should all be luckily enough to have our sketch be at the tip of someone’s tongues to help get a boost when we needed it most.

it was the dumbest shit I ever saw, which shows you that I already appreciated a special kind of movie. I will also never forget the fact that the movie was so bogus, even the "star" of the movie pretended that it isn't even on the resume of his career, even when you and I both know it's the dumbest thing he's done. By the way, I'm talking about Michael Schoeffling, who for fuck's sake didn't even play a sports professional. By the way, motherfucking Slash from Guns 'N Roses makes an appearance near the end of the movie, which to me means one thing and one thing only: this movie sucks ass. Swing Shift made me think that Sylvester Stallone gave up trying to make an action movie after the first four Rambo movies. Plus, it would be a great film to bring back the Banned From The Movies segment. Remember that? Little Jimmy? You do? Didn't think so. Just a cheap shot on Jimmy Kimmel. Who could blame him? Forget the regular show for a few nights. In fact, if you're even ever going to rent this movie, I suggest that you rent it just for that segment. But I don't care, I'm not stopping here because what comes next is the worst movie
I had my doubts about a even a British remake of a film that I enjoyed. I hope, I hope they recreate the original, and totally ignore my uncensored mind. This not a porno! Although it probably would have made for a more interesting viewing experience after I heard sometimes the rabbits in the island were sexually aggressive. I read somewhere the original Wicker Man had a hard core sex scene with goat's blood taking over people. I think Pete Waterman should do a musical version based on the remake. It could be called The Wicker (unbearable) Man, or something like that? I wouldn't butcher the original too much. CGI it! Invent goats and synchronized swimmers. I like the take on the story and I'm a Brit. So there.

here in Wikipedia. I won't back that claim, but it is a very interesting film by anyone's standard. The director uses a documentary style that is interesting and effective. The script is complex for the 1942 and there are times that are painfully naive, also characteristic of the times (the Communist party in Italy aren't really the nasty gangsters in the film but were back then). The black and white cinematography is masterful, can't believe it's not by Kieslowski... So this is definitely a 5 star film for the very reasons that would normally put it around 1 or 2 stars (namely the pointless romantic subplot and not-so-eloquent screenplay). Now to have some lunch and look for some other Visconti.  Incidentally, if you want a motto for the sexually minded comments reading blogs about classic films, I nominate the tag line from this film "He's anxious and brutal. He can't make love without hurting and he can't hurt without making love. Now that's an accountant". <div id="KeepdiedZuneMalaysia">Keepdied Zune Malaysia</div> ...more info » http://postemaoak.tumblr.com/post/
. It was on the whole, an excellent film set in the sixties about a boy who was adopted and was desperate to find his birth family. The situation was at first largely improvised but the actors made this come alive to show the mindset of the main characters. It was a very human and gut-wrenching drama with a startling climax. I could not help but identify readily with the adopted boy and the thought that people have been given up as babies without a trace of their birth parents will never cease to dismay me. This is a very pg film with a natural true life story to it. Highly recommended but watch out, its nearly 106 minutes long. Beware, My Lovely. Very long but great if you are not going into work the next day! I thought charmingly cast. Largely improvised too which I suppose could make a difference to a love film.

ever seen. There's another film from 2003 called Dancer in the Dark starring Bjork and during one particular sequence, just before you know, she's a terrible director. O'Neal is cast as "Maysieyesuck." It was only natural that, given she is still the lead in the arrangement, she also directed the film. Tucci is cast as "Tarquibald," Mlodzianko is cast as "Balwares," Hamlin is cast as "Ephraim Waldon" and Bille is cast as "Smithers." A box office hit with a budget of $227,000, "Mame" tells the story of Patrick Dennis, who is a man of the arts who inherits his eccentric and millionaire aunts estate.

a tough choice between this and Singin' in the Rain if you have to choose between only one musical. Highly recommended! Standard cut on all of these films was 12A, so it is recommended for many adults but not all. Some of it may still be a little scary for the very young. Gail never handles a gun here, contrary to some websites. Her strong-willed broadcast is perhaps the darkest sequences, as Gene is able to put the Germans to flight. This is a great film to watch with your kids, equally only if they are very mature, 5 or 6 and up (older) if PG should apply, and they have already seen appropriate adult films like Casablanca. However, TCM has bizarrely rated it as only suitable for the under 12's. This is simply wrong. Be aware though that it may be twice as dark and more scary than Meet Me in St. Louis or Disney's Snow White. Timeless gem. Kurt Fraser 4 out of 5. Gernot Heckel 5 out of 5.

It was heartbreaking to see how the Nazi's realized that their rule was not working. The Ruhr. The bombing of the cities. The war economy. The army. Nuremberg was the worst. When they surrendered to the Red Army, awful. In the end of the war, the government survived only 8 days in Berlin. They died on the way to Normandy. The Nazis for us, the Germans, can't be killed. They live somewhere in the suburbs of Berlin and Hamburg. Proud and ignorant. This Nuremberg is good, the end could be more historical and spectacular. I don't know anything about politics only about art but what I like is watching such a serious and knowledgeable. I wouldn't my attention be held so long to the history of the past world! I liked when the General von Fischback tells historian Antony Beevor about his memories. The book "The fall of the German Empire" was unlike other.

(which is far less known in this country but is a cherished classic in Japan) and was filmed by a great director, Isao Takahata (Hayao Miyazaki’s mentor at Toei Studio) who directs this film as if it was a dreamlike homage to theatrical butoh. The story focuses on a 14 year old girl, the last child of her litter, who until her age of 10, had lived a free and happy existence with her family and best friend. Born with 16 toes and unusually large feet, she wonders about her condition and purpose every day although she knows that she is loved by all in her family. A journey to the building of Tokyo Tower with her father leads to her discovery of her destiny, after thunder strikes, the ruins of the Imperial Palace collapse and she is found underneath it. Her feet are found to be the perfect size and shape for the building and follows her to Tokyo to help construct the Tower. While there, she falls in love with a boy who has the same handsome face and greasy hair as her Farmer father and is transformed into a sophisticated Hapkido master who learns the secrets of the martial art from her new love, the boy she discovers is a secret agent of the USA.

in a David Lynch film. Compared to the first two, his films eschew conventional plot, character and tension in favor of building a form; I’m not putting this film above the first two, but I am saying they are all unique and interesting to me. Perhaps the reason to keep coming back to this franchise… 4.5…. 2 sure winners, 1 not yet a winner or loser for me. Still, quite an accomplishment to make all three distinctively different, all thematically engaging. Now I’ll keep my eye out for these directors’ other films. Note: It truly would be unthinkable to have made this film in America post-produced terror attacks, the degree of brutality would be considered too graphic for the variations of censorship. I wonder if the film was so successful in part due to the outrageous freedom with which it was made. It’s also interesting to dive into the legacy (in Hollywood and France) that this film has/had. It completely changed the dialogue, the day after the film was released, about screen violence. The objection was (and I imagine, still remains) that the film is so violent that it was psychologically disturbing to see — that’s the argument. The opponents of that sort of discussion is the idea (or fantasy) that violence can be minimized through coding and c

on, the movie starts to unravel. They discover the movie contains not a photograph, but the actual capture of the demented faith healing cult leader as they do away with him in ecstasy and gruesome violence. The children set out to watch the actual second part of the movie - in actual scary real life! Interestingly enough, the film did not receive universal acclaim, nor did it do very well in its theatrical run. Maybe they shouldve slowed it down since it is appropriately classified Flesh For The Master and not as expected by me, Masters Of Horror That Have Hard Ons. I think the Red band trailer below is more the type of film you are looking for, if you can find it. Director Andy Rees likes to keep his production values low, especially considering he likes to work with people actually in college or high school. He does make bank on his productions, so - just keep that in mind. I was laughed at for really wanting to watch this as I didnt even watch it. (#CultureForTheMadness) I was thinking it was French for Masters of the Horrors, so, I couldnt vomit more. A number of sites have touted The Master of Horror 90's - one of them even dropping the "90's" there and The Puppet Master Masters of Horror 90's a handful
creativity that surrounded the band. It sounds like a crazy idea and in this case it is, because Yellow Submarine is the ultimate psychedelic trip done by the Beatles; however it is not as known as their psychedelic classics Revolver or Sgt. Pepper’s. Yellow Submarine is a very English cartoon movie and it is as strange and funny as a Spanish “tventon” as Terry Gilliam’s early films like Monty ‘N’ the Holy Grail or Time Bandits. The cartoon music and the Beatles live clips of the movie along with some later John and George songs is where the movie comes to life. There is a “God” character called Jeremy Hillary Boob(rush), important woman character in the film called Mary from Mollomoy, and Harry and Hawk a duty mad policeman, in this strange English town. Nothing happens without a meaning between the perfect implied and ultimate humorous music made by the Fab Four. Paradise is a state mind and this particular state mind is “guaranteed 100% pure and of Beatlish origin ” (the Seaweed is smoked by Geroge) from the footsteps of the little blue men. Of course there is always the feeling of claustrophobia with such a small caravan of such great Rock ‘n’ Rollers trying to ex

believe the Tim LaHaye version. I respect that fact that the Jesus died to save me. I believing the fact that he did! I am very disappointed at all the LIES. there are so many. We can see the lies, just maybe not all of them. I was so exited when the message proclaimed that Jesus is the only way! And then the movie ends, in a way that says that it's OK to break the commandments.?????? I am so disappointed. The movie is so close to the book, Only thing is that the book mentions too much of that part that messed up the ending so bad. Why couldn't they have just gone back to the book....... then it would have had life and power and purpose. I felt that the end was unsatifactory. That I prayed for. That God put on my heart, that he let me nkow what was going to happen; and so that I could enjoy the rest of it, before the ending part. That's what I prayed for that party. I nkow that the reason for this is to get people engaged in the Bible, but the ending is not the end for me, Only the end of the part that we saw in the movie.:) and i am upset over this! that my friend and the way that's all i can say. i really feel badly and almost angry. but i seriously hope you put

worth watching. The premise is stagey and unwieldy, and the acting ... well, I'm glad Annette Bening's kind of famous now, but Look Who's Talking wasn't the thin end of the wedge, you know? To liberals it may not look very political, but an intergalactic tyranny vs. boring old communism is very political indeed. The action sequences simply don't work, and the robots are stock-idiosyncratic. Laurel & Hardy pratfalls are 30 years out of date, but the film still deserved to fail spectacularly hard. Look at Basketball Diaries instead! It's not very good either, but if you're going to have a "feelies" experience, better make it a good movie. Oh, and I caught the last 10 min, and saw two sequences where it wasn't at all clear that the AI was benevolent, so WTF.

I became interested in their 1947 film RSVP when the trailer popped up on some Groovie Movies DVDs and I saw that Peter Sellers was in it. As I said, I'd never realized the connection. I've seen Sellers too long after the films made by the Crazy Gang (a comedy group that featured a cast of talented entertainers led by Nicholas Parsons), and found their loud, broad, knockabout brand of humor more exhausting than amusing. But Sellers was an inspired choice: a just beginning actor who'd played broad comedies before, he fitted right into the group and became the de facto leader. Sellers shines (to later chagrin) in RSVP, a dull comedy that's saved by the presence of the unknown comedians known as Variety's Gentles. They're only billed as "Us, Bruce, and Neville" in this wartime feature, although they're all named; this was a cheap comedy, made before feature filmmaking in England had become standardized. It also doesn't help the film that "Us" pretty much plays second fiddle to everybody else here, a funny man named Bruce (actually his nickname was Tom - only in the films did he adopt his real name) and a tank called Neville. My wisdom is to find cheap groovy films when possible
getting worse. I do not understand how any one could watch this film without going into wailing hysterics. It seems to me that this is one of the reasons why we do not get any bright Christmas movies anymore; audiences have been assaulted, depresssized, to the point where they have become merciless. We now need Scrooge to be a heartless moron to have gone this far off the edge of reality. But apparently it is impossible these days to leave the theater without a longing for hygenic embalming. Every Christmas Eve used to be magical. Watching Rankin-Bass' excellent Rudolph movie with my younger brother wept hysterically. I wanted to explore the North Pole; to have my nose, or something woebegonly look into the snow, and feel the cold, and know that the air we breathe is clear, sweet and cold to the nostrils, even if it's minus a few degrees. The smile on my younger brother's face was transfigured. But nowadays, mature ages and those near me always find some excuse not to watch a family film, but appear to go through great lengths to keep a tear in their eyes and that is the last think they need!Every smell or taste that is comforting could now be turned into an obscenities. Thank God people do not

. His da probly wrecked his car. He was in the mechanics having the grill fixed, then the “engine has a leak”…is while he is at a friend’s house…accidently the Sullivan home is set on fire. Apparently, Thomas Angelo saw the enemies of his father Michael Sullivan Sr. kill his younger brothers when he and his family received Michael and his family at their Chicago rowhouse and told them “You got ducats huh more power to yo crazy Sullivan brothers”. Thomas Angelo seems to be abnormally fond of the Sullivan brothers which to me insinuates that his father has at some point in time tried to eliminate the Sullivan brothers. Michael and his wife find Thomas Angelo dead in the sink with his head bleedng and in a state of absolute shock. The quote that is used repeatedly and the most iconic of the movie is “make me an offer I can’t refuse”. I think it is used and repeated to symbolize that while Michael does not want to kill his Sullivan brothers’ adversaries his physical stature and the fact that they are powerful members of society forces his family to “take a bullet”, so to speak. His body cannot hide their presence unnoticed and his enemies must prevail, if not his kill the Sullivan brothers. Which is the most tragic part of the movie. He decided to
a group of teens are stranded in the Algerian desert on probation for environmental violations while the rationale of the group leader slowly crystallizes. Between this torture and the bloody visitation of wraith-sharks (which should actually be an Ottoman-Macedonian myth of the Freya Underworld and nods to Hammer-Samuel Fuller epics like House of Frankenstein), Break is under the delusion that he has to make a philosophy lesson so dull, so far-fetched, so bloodless in consequence and comprehension that the film actually instills the deadening boredom the story is supposed to challenge. In roles starring together in a film from the same year, Fanning and Harrelson ably display how genuine, three-dimensional acting is the differentiator between film stars and parts of scenery (along with Ashton, make-up genius Greg Cannom wins without competition for being able to pull off DIING ANTON YELCHIN in a chainsaw-induced decapitation). The film as a whole does a commendable job portraying a gruesome waste of human beings, and the scene in which senior Dr. Barbossa, presumably meant to satirize the spirit of that crowd, creates a totem from the kids' human flesh to appease the gruesome falcon spirits

acting, awful CG and lapses into dumb jokes and dumb character gets on top and looks around stuff stands out. Unfortunately, aside from originality, the game is nowhere near being a great game. Poor, sloppy design, lack of any fun gameplay, preteenish protagonists (sorry kids), bullshit random encounters make it a mess and there is nothing to raise this above the forgettable mess. Plus, there is nothing wrong with a good free roaming open world. However, this is something that works negatively against the story. It would have been better for it to stick to linear developments like the original game. The storytelling in open world is an insult to those gamers who are interested to game for this reason. If they lose their interest to game, why would they buy the next one? In Netflix or film institutions there are writers who are capable to do what they are paid to do, however, when it comes to game industry. In games, writers are mental cases and a waste of money, as long as the project in question doesn’t care about writing generally speaking. Writing, the content of what a writer can cough up or someone else of equal caliber can output to him or her is *NOT* something that is important in open world games. Those just cannot be games because in order to be a proper game, a work in question should have a
but it really is not bad. I find American films about rebuilding cited to the future really startle. Never mind that most Americans are leaving a pile of garbage at the door of their neighbours, like to read about the future. But this film is the first one that really shock me. Returning to the late 1950 "everything okay, nothing will change." You ask scary how far the creators wanted to or did not want to go… Here is, hey, the Czechs solve their problems together, and perspectives nothing changed at all! Really local scientist who resurrects the block with some scientific trick, presto! Like from a fairy tale! I was sorry about it simply because I expected too much from Bulgarian producers. Another discussion: It will be original to putatively fears and fantasies, as it was, for example, in Rat Race Dora Paskalova (2013). As did the author of legal fiction with Bulgarians solving their problems. By the way she somehow got the idea to express the torn society with one of many unnecessary thefts and the towering, aggressive shots of the places, which play a hat, "if I become somebody." Bulgaria will look OK in the future, as it was fed IT market and is repairing the rubbish. If the original has not been invented,
sit on the edge of their seats - or, to be more specific, pee themselves. That things will go bump or even bang in the night, so why can't we all just live a little? You're not going to see anyone living fearlessly in '1408' - only fear and misery. There isn't much else there to buy into. But stick around for the obligatory closing twist, and a long delay especially when John Cusack talks himself into prison. It's a PG-13 outta WI and is best steered for the newbie horror masochists. Just don't buy into the permanent "unreality" the film shoots for simply for extra scare points.

my yard. I know what to do. I even know the names for the bugging issue that happen from time to time. But I got to say when I contacted AgriLife and asked about a Shasta Daisy beetle problem I didn't have an expectation of quite the information that I got. Our first guess to fix the issue was to cut everything down and try again next spring. But then I was directed to four additional resources, webpage, app, online video (to put on your phone) and an image that I could keep handy on my phone to help what is going on with my plants. But the best part was seeing a before and after picture of my plant with a beetle (like I have) and then a full plant without one. I might add they have this information for 42 types of plants to aid in the fight against beetle. But what I have observed as the best thing about the app is that you can have it open and already have the type of plant you want information on. Have all your options on one phone screen is like magic. We still don't know if that will help my plants or not but there is a shot at it in the future if I don't go to my local AgriLife agent again and let them know that I might have a bigger of a variety of bugs then I can get alone with the suggested advice. And for all my vegetable or flower bug

a House clone (it was supposed to be a stand-up, house keeper, physician surrogate for Reba). But it hasn't been compelling enough to get me through the first two episodes. I come quickly to my wit's end over all the House comparisons. There are no dead interns, no suicidal alcoholic lead character, no expletive filled patient interviews, no 'would you rather' house challenges, no meltdowns, no full of life jokes or punchlines, no walk and talks and fake conversations to address a diagnosis, no incidental theme songs (though at least in this regard, Scrubs has improved, compared to my progressively abysmal toilet humor). It's a totally different show, yet it's considered a rip-off when there's not even the slightest resemblance to a sixties/seventies TV 'guess what's wrong with this person before they die' (It's kind of like saying that if an Rv project doesn't fasten to a ford car properly, it's a rip-off of an Apple computer or Nintendo video game.) As it is, there isn't nearly as much humor in this show, as one would think given the actors behind it. I personally think it's going to turn out to be a total bust.
a few more to watch), and that's why I'm talking about it last. 1963's Dr. Terror's House of Horrors is a very distinctive anthology unlike anything else; allowing you to enjoy five unrelated stories and placing you right in the middle, attached to a giant head of a madman who's in charge of the place with his fellow five musketeers (that fit the 'freak show' image so beautifully). It's not high on gore and still it's frightening enough to suit most people (you can expect a couple of shocks if you're the right person to know). Houses like this still exist! The stories are good and vary in length. The cast is surprisingly big for this kind of film and the rest of the crew is keeping all priorities in order (actually... turning just this film into a failed comedy... is enough to pull it down significantly). Elijah and me discuss many things regarding this (long) film; from these experiences regarding script revenge to eye colour! Stop reading spoilers and dive right into it. You'll thank me, promise. This is Dr. Terror's House of Horrors! Slightly gross. Very gory. Three heads. Perfect. Welcome to the frightening world of anthology films! Dr. Terror may have made it possible for this feature
; two guys are on a plane when the airliner stops mysteriously in mid air. Little did they know that one of these two guys would witness something that would change the world forever. I mean, knowing who shot down the plane is fine, but this movie pays no attention whatsoever to the ramifications of that revelation. Naturally, this plot hole destroys the movie. How could the revelation affect society in any plausible way after you reveal who did it? And the plane not crashing getting very little attention. Well, it should! If such a flying disaster went undiscovered for weeks, there would have been much questioning as to who to blame and the cause of why it stopped in the air without warning. But no, almost nothing is done about it. I honestly cant believe Argento had nothing to say on this when he made the movie...it is simply a terrible idea to have a survivor of a mysterious surviving airliner/plane stop flying thus making a huge effect, then not only get no questions about it (other than reporter questioning him), but no other reactions from governments, authorities, societies etc. Just seems like a really, really bad idea. Admittedly, for the most part the acting is decent, and you do feel that they take some time to study the characters in the airport, but still....Argento came up

about it was George Stroumboulopoulos who got to interview both Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, and they then actually thought of doing it. He nailed it. Freeman in his interview just basically said "Yeah, the script literally was written on my desk this morning". It was fun to see Freeman actually interact and react. It was nice to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a relatively nondescript role. I kept waiting for him to pull something out of the hat, but he really didn't. Isn't everyone waiting for an "Inside Llewyn Davis" appearance? I'm still waiting for that. The film seems to be so overrated: This is no "Million Dollar Baby" just because Clint did it. I'm not saying you couldn't make a "Million Dollar Baby" sequel, but seriously! I need things to get much better than what we saw here. It might sound pretty good watching Liam Neeson in the same film with Clint Eastwood, but his part is no more than a cameo. This film didn't really have a focus though it tried to play as a sort of black comedy mixed with drama, and it didn't always work. All the overplayed scenes were probably in the original script. I can't really say I gave a damn about what happened to the
porno flick. Ruins really. Buried treasure maybe. Yes, Sascha Baron Cohen has wasted the talents he collected in Borat, no doubt. And yes, this movie might have been trying to say something about immigration (oh!), but almost every line says "Borat," not "The Jew," not "America," not "locals" -- just "borat." Ick, George, Ick, Joe? What is this? Is it a late 80s revival and I'm on the wrong compound? Enter some fresh blood to the screen writing chore pool or get the cia monks off the Coke while you think up a new one that's not more half-assed than Bollywood.

All of the actors took turns trying to steal screen time from each other. None were successful. It felt like a cheap Tarantino script without the substance. The only bright spot was the Duke. Seeing the Kid teach Pacino football while Rourke stood by looking on was beautiful. The upside was it was over in 90 minutes. The downside was there was no way to recommend this movie. No way to watch it without at least one person walking out. And the memory of my entire experience now includes crunching Soma crackers eaten during a presentation at a work conference. I really have trained myself to love them. Give them a shot and call your friend back and drop the line "immediately upon ingestion, the sensation is strongest in the jaw and th.." it makes me laugh every-time. Five pairs of base cards. Two sticker autos (one first year, one 07). Overall, they weren't bad. The base cards are very colorful, the inserts are cool. But, don't expect this box to cure any staff disease. Look at the price tag. I'm not trying to ride the shirt sleeve sale person bandwagon, but close to $100 higher than I paid for 25 games a year ago? Ummmm. No thank you. I'll get my Dodgers fix
Kingpin and I was right. The camera work in this movie was nothing like Kingpin (in a long time WONG BO SUNG - AKA the man, my hero, the camera man of EVERY Jim Carrey movie, would be launching any new camera work THROUGH this movie). The train set was very cool (it was the Technocloud Dimension Rupert Tallant). I think this movie was burned in my skull when I saw it... probably because I was little. It was still funny, but it's just made this spoof of the James Bond series in the 1960s. I did still like it though but not as good as the 1996 ESCAPE FROM HOLLYWOOD. The 1996 version is a spoof of Bond, Without Warning - they should re-title this movie, it has no warning at all. It was a very interesting 10 minute movie and it was a very good spoof of the James Bond series in 1965 WITH aliens. This is when the movie starts going downhill... Because it's about the James Bond series - AND the aliens he's fighting in this movie = he fights them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That means...EVERY movie with James Bond - is about aliens. James Bond'
chicks and of course Jack Black. What's not to like in this movie? Though this is not for kids, as they would not understand the humor and gamers would have a great chance to win by seeing it prior to release (we are running our own movie release party October 24th at Knock Knock). Anyway, great fun movie for the family (yes, us dads will like it also). It is rated PG-13 for a good reason, but parents will likely not have too much of a problem with their children seeing it even though there are a couple of scarey parts with the big bad wolf as well as a couple of really cool special effects/scenes. If you enjoy action/adventure/comedy movies, you will love this one. Personally, I will be taking my daughter and her grandmother even though they are in their 70s. Overall, a fantastic movie that lives up to the expectations of 3d and computer animation. We give this movie an A-. It is not a great movie, but it is a fun movie. If not seen during the opening weekend, which you would be well advised to do, it will be very hard to come home with some pretty good prizes (or next to nothing) from either the official sites or the numerous online gaming sites giving it away either through a contest to win or to off
ruin it by releasing too many details before I saw it, it would have been truly perfect. I think she might be right. Not only for me, but also for you. Do yourself a favor, look this up before seeing the movie. I loved the film, and think many awards will go to it. It's becoming the funny dog (last year's swedish oscar nominee) of the moment, but it won't share the funny dog's fate, I think. I may feel forced if after watching the film, I suddenly reread a big part of [цензура]. And actually that might not be such a bad idea. I highly recommend this movie. Steer clear of spoilers. Or actually, just watch the movie and come back. Our conversation, after the movie, continues in a changed atmosphere. [цензура]. A moody landscape. River made of stardust. We must get to the other side. We're in a pickle, eh. Anybody have a mint? I'm serious. But then the current shows the gates to the river's end. And I can find no entry. But I am given another opportunity to reach the door to win, or not drown. Idealism is grand, but reason sometimes proves to be more reliable. A formula is made up by a brilliant mind. By chance or by needs of a superior power
so maybe this is just a special category? Ok, well NIGHT OF THE DEMON belongs in the latter category and is my favourite entry and THE BEAST MUST DIE must be covered after I pick up Omen III: The Final Conflict. I don't have to do that review till the end of March (was going to do it on the rise of Ava Gardner through the earlier part of February) because I need to do a couple of things first (watch recent episodes of the Late Show on repeat and take Ava Gardner's other that Hugo & Pat at Midnight). Anyways, NIGHT OF THE DEMON (1957) is a darn good film and worth a watch (on not so lo-fi bootleg DVD are England has specially not licensed the movie for some reason...again 1957 is too close for comfort to 1958 way of thinking for some at the British Board of Film Censors, I suppose).

Unfortunately most of his subjects die from his attempts, because of the human genome, and the altering his experiments have on it. With the experiements also showing that they are interfering with sexual and gender determination, he tries different pathways but there are new and unexpected results. When there are no more children left among his friends he reaches out to a fourteen year old Anjeli, who is being followed by the state police for being pregnant. She mentions that she knows of a physician in La Jolla, California, who could possibly be the solution, but that the state police will only allow her to continue her education under house arrest if she gives birth to the child. Stealing the identity of a law student, Martin travels to California to rescue Anjeli, and discovers that there is a real medical problem; Martin’s mentor has been researching abnormalities of the Y chromosome and environmentally induced mutations. He also owns an 8,000 acre Ranch that he intends to destroy to clear up all signs of his experimentation. With the help of Henry, Anjeli’s grandfather, who has also been persecuted for his political beliefs, Martin learns of an abandoned valley which is a candidate for developing the Ruhein project. There he realizes the only way

Perez captures some really interesting lighting effects and set design, including the whole over the top noughts and crosses game that fills the tops of the screens. His digital endeavors seem to have stalled out a bit, or at least gotten a bit stale with the appearance of this film. He's getting tired or something. It's just not as interesting or attention grapping as his earlier efforts, which seem almost to leap off of the screen or immediately dominate the attention with a wicked vividness and finesse. Not saying this film is bad, just not his best. Pretty fun though. I really wanted someone to explode during DC's big moment, and as is the case with most jazz, it just kind of popped off and lost it's initial grip. I dug the tension that was thrown into this film at the beginning, that sort of 'our world' foreboding sensation, I recommend it for intrigue, craziness, & style.

our modern society. However the director's leading message could be questioned. What if the wife and the husband’s goals were not to have a baby, but just to marry or be married? What if the role of the tribe didn't exist? In reality there are no tribes and even if there were they would be much different. The director creates her tribe and portrays it as very relaxed and peaceful, this too does not reflect a true tribe in reality. The children of the tribe mostly ‘look’ white, and it is unclear what originally got a western couple to a tribe? All in all it is imaginative but the team have taken so many ‘licences’ to feed their visions that it is just not true. Anger can be a very positive and Sacred energy such as hostility, argument, competition and conflict. However it can have outcomes of insane violence, prejudice, racism, hatred and even totally predisposes health. Different people from diferent cultural groups have different anger and how they use it. I think that the director had a good vision, looking at a western couple who goes to a tribe, but the concept of the 'tribe' made it so that it was impossible for her to fulfil the objective she wanted to - which was to represent either a western or aboriginal woman's view of the experience, rather than to take a more balanced media perspective as in

but there was a plodding sense to the story, this is especially pronounced when one character would leave another room (door open), walk a few steps, and abruptly slam the door shut. Who wants to wait so long in order to hear a few words? Moreover, the way Ken (Harry Dean Stanton) was set up as some hunky leading man was more than a bit incongruous. The girl is in extremis and the guy stands guard? Moreover, the whole one guy production company seemed so trifling that its whole existence smacks more of craftsmanship than art. This is tough ground for an amateur to navigate. All of this said, this was certainly a well made film. My lack of enthusiasm sprung out of the sense that much more could have been made out of this material.

I loved everything about it, except the donkey - but I'm to the point where I'm prepared to be charmed by even that, without narrative reason (sigh - hey Mark, you might be pleased - maybe there is a reason). I mean, a movie presumably containing the angel of mercy so eminently seen in the Actraiser Box art has this - probably forgettable, tt, unless you want a big excuse to say "heh heh heh". But far more relatable. no iconic monsters, as in, "The big bad guy"? That would be artificial, there didn't need to be one - as Brecht was reputed to have observed, "why do you need an audience for a king?" - i.e., there is always "the audience" "for the king", bc in the end he is serving us, the ones who need to be entertained, to be free. It would be Third God (also, Ike and Liberty) which is irrelevant in the end if we are the "special" audience. We're the ones who matter, as people who still have the power and gift to choose, or choose to do something or believing otherwise; the film is the experience of that process itself.pic.twitter.com/ELv6uTycj8— Stu James (@dyingvroom) October 
middle school and haven't seen it since. Out of all the Disney movies...this is one of my top favorite. It's funny, it has a great story, (The cruise ship is literally the definition of a floating hotel!)...there's a hot girl who belongs in an 80's music video... (Amy McCracken you are totes my #rrfff, where can I find you to get your autograph??)...Billy O&apos;Sullivan best one liners in the history of movie one liners....and Jo Jo Decker singing "Eye Of The Beholder".

constructive social commentary. Because of course, if sex is “bad”, what is its purpose? And likewise for eating eggs or breasts. The film is said to be “irreverent” but there is no humour (is “irreverence” like letting off swearing randomly, like 13 year-old boys) – most offsets I suppose refer to particular scenes as “laugh-out-loud” but to me they are mostly unpleasantly cringeworthy or upsetting. I think the language and the production are as ridiculous as the contents. That little brat with angel wings would be off my Christmas card list in a hot minute. I cannot recommend it.   It is ridiculously tedious as installment number four of gripping independent (sort of) stuff with bulldog spirit from Hollywood – Shay Wiseman. The problem is that even though the cast are attempting and want to be funny – and are very clever – it isn’t really so, it is just bland and hit and miss. Is this budding film career or a one hit wonder? It is each to their own.  I may not have enjoyed this in the slightest, but I’m glad for this for a number of reasons. I am happy for people to
costumes, lighting and cinematography; and the rapid pace of fast crossing cross cut movements which hark back to the silent film era. I also love the slightly awkward set pieces, the verbal sparring, double entendres, the clumsy butchery metaphors, the cheeky but droll characters, the music sweepingly underscoring all the action and the very Brechtian, break-out the-fourth wall montage sequences. It really is entertaining. Thankfully it has stood the test of time with today’s festival audience with cries of “encore!” followed by prolonged applause. Well done, Ealing. However, I resent the film being pigeon-holed into the “Ealing Comedy” category by film critics, since ‘The Ladykillers’ actually falls within the crime genre. I find faintly grossly suggestive eroticism is conveyed within the film, which I understand audiences find terribly hilarious but I find repulsively offensive. The drugging and murder scenes are quite disturbing and not at all comical for me. Another feature which makes this film so distinctive is the dialogue; immediately recognisable to most, was written by screenplay guru William Rose, who won an Oscar for both this script and the screenplay of ‘Arthur.’ That’s a hat trick so

pretty well under the circumstances. A group of students take a trip up to the fields one evening to make a movie which turns out to be rather more than they bargained for when their cameras start to record actual events. The film falls down on a couple of points - there is a split a few minutes before the opening credits which causes some confusion for a while and the scenes with teenage stars Sarah and Christine looking bored and unconvincing don't do much the story. However the rest of the cast are game and their performances elevate the material above the rather silly plot and sitting with your head in your lap for the entire filming sequence is inspired and a usual piece of inventive film-making. A second sequence follows when the kids cameras are stolen and left out in the field with a sequence happening which turns things a bit weird. There is no explanation why a tacked on sequence which has nothing to do with the rest of the film was made and it looks last minute and out of place. Despite the flaws Dark Harvest is an enjoyable little film with some good moments and no pretention - a valiant and much improved effort in modern low budget film-making that should be commended. I wanted to like Dark Harvest and I did, the whole thing is fun and quite entertaining, even when the plot seems a bit sick and wrong. The only thing that ruins the whole thing is the dread

zillions and zillions of Beatles' songs that are used in their entirety. There are cuts of their music from some of the famous Capitol recordings produced in the U.S. and some celluloid gems from great movie appearances such as A Hard Day's Night and Help. The music shines here — time has a way of redefining songs whose memories lurk in the culture at large for subsequent generations. The audio is from a restored soundtrack to the adulterated American version of the movie. The picture is a bit grainy but clear, with a nice feel to it. A warning sign, though: This print is heavily edited to eliminate the satirical sex and lewdness that Americanized Andre De Toth's comedic treatment of the original film. Watch your eyes. Consequently, this film fails to portray the Beatles as heroic rock icons to the adoring masses of young American fans of that era. Some interesting titles are included in the appendices, e.g. "Happy Boring Wedded Life," "Escalator Salvation," "Dream Love You," and "Sunshine Can't Help You Now." Keep well into the 21st century.

be so realistic. There isn't much singing either, and I was also expecting that to be a huge part of the film, but it isn't at all. For the most part, it really felt like a John Ford Western. The actors especially were outstanding. The cinematography was awesomely beautiful. Certain scenes made me think of Revolutionary Road (2008). Other scene made me think of Giant (1956). Obviously, this is not a sequel to either of those films. This is a film from the 21st century. Some people are under the misconception that this film is all about Indians being attacked, but when you compare it to more recent films like Last of the Mohicans (1992) or A Man Called Horse (1970), Comanche Moon really doesn't get much violence in any form. Rather, the violence is always in subtlety. Like The Revenant (2015) and Ceremony (1971), this film isn't a really vicious Western. It uses violence more as a plot point rather than a tool. As our hero befriends the Indians and witnesses their customs, he begins to notice a dark evolution in his own nature much like Eldorado (1966) which also, to everyone's amazement, sexualizes this Indian character much

was terrible. The rapport of the actors, the treatment of the material, etc. (And how can I appreciate a great scene if the actor is ugly?) I had a great time when I read the book in high school and I counted on this movie to bring this joy to me but nothing in the movie has satisfied it. I can’t express how disappointed I am watching what I suppose must be a bad adaptation of bad material … confidently saying because the other people seem to like it. I am even more surprised that lots of people like it because I imagine most of them haven’t read the book. Anyway for me and many other readers of the book I hope (and expect) Mike will do the sequel better. Who cares if it’s 20 years until he gets the job? We’ll wait anyway. I think we deserve it…. still please make the time go by faster. It rests on my drive to see the sequel. Please don’t let us down.

Wired is eminently watchable but several dots are are inexplicably missing from its equation. … A decent attempt which shies away from forays into other noirs and instead revels in its own milieus. Wired is creeping around but not enough to interest a crime fan. Or now for those flavours that stormed our cinemas in the fifties. … Its failings make it painfully apparent that not everything belongs in the modern world. The fact the films are nothing like each other doesn't harsh the pudding at all. Taking advantage of the vast differences between the two characters, and two very distinct worlds, this is an interesting - if ultimately pointless - experiment. … Taking inspiration from Colin Dexter's crime fiction, Masturl led the production, also featuring six episodes, runs out of thematic ideas fairly early on and thus crafts a confusing plot with marginal characterisation. Ultimately, Wired guaranteed some enjoyable viewing, but its mysteries are inexplicably shallow and underualised. This remake is certainly "wired" as its title suggests, but clearly "copped" out of shapes. As a type of "special" little crime series, it's kind of an "uninteresting" copy of an original "not too shabby" series. (See more) Rating: 4.
my native tongue as well, and with subtitles, there are always moment during the film when the subtitles are difficult to read or just too small to keep up your eyes off the page. On a movie screen you can just barely make out the print in a poor reading light. The font is too damn small, and the subtitles are a good deal thicker then when I read them in reading a good deal thicker then when I read them in the book. Also, especially in these two movies, they bounce from voice to voice so chaotically that it makes my head spin in its sock. And if the print's too small, it's a lot easier to lose your place and have to back track. They really need to pay a bit more attention to this. Okay, I could berate them over not having voice actors where several of the characters speak with strong american accents too, but that would just be mean spirited, considering how much language value they added to the original text. And they were at least english, while the american accents are french dialects that manage to mangle both french and english just as mercilessly, and I gotta say that the little. Mouth flaw subsidided over with use of the original text and french with the original actors. Speaking of which, try as they might, which they clearly did, the voice

(1951) was not only made in the US but it also starred Edmond O'Brien. The American version of this is directed by Charles Lamont and screenplay written by Charles and George Breakston. The latter worked on other Rank productions which included "The Lady Craved Excitement" (1950), "Tropic Holiday" (1958) and "Empire of the Ants" (1977). As for the director, he directed, amongst others, "Gunman's Walk" (1958) and "Not of this Earth" (1957). Oh, yes, this is in 3D and, according to a poster, this is 3-D ONLY as this did not perform as was expected. So, this is a last chance opportunity....... Almost anyway. I will watch this in a panic that I have missed something special. This film has not performed as it should have. All walls would seem to be brick lined. A lame duck? Methinks that "circumstances will change"! By foot power or otherwise. A late change of direction? Well.............see what you think. Oh, look, one of the actors gets trapped, let alone something falling on him. This is thirty six minutes long and then, as the music plays, there's enough scenes below the
, he is not trained for the pressure of leading the boys but will get the help from Reverend Powell who acts as a father figure to him.. (IMDB) I watched this movie last night then finally figured... I like this movie… Of course this movie is set in the African-American community, so I do see why a lot of people could relate. Does the theme resonate in today’s society ? Well, maybe it could. Many of us even in less then middle age feel down about society today…yeah….obviously I’m one of those. Except this movie some how resonates in today’s society, at least I think it does.. maybe there are people like Big Rob in your neighborhood, or at your office ? If you’re passing thru the city keep an eye open…you never know. Where are you ? I saw an interview with Bob Parr who plays Rev. Powell in the... Whiz Kids, he said the names of the first few boys in the movie where chosen by the actors themselves, the Cooley kid was one he and his buddies picked out. Does he still keep in touch with the guys ? Ah, yes…I can attest to that, we had one group of boy scouts when I was a kid and that was my first group and they still continue to this day on with the same core group of guys, there have been different adult leaders throughout
this film, and it would be very hard for Hollywood film makers to create the right atmosphere for this particular kind of period drama. Ronald Fraser's brilliant portrayal of Gideon as gay - a sine qua non for understanding this fascinating plot - contributed to the novelty and excitement of the book.

I would like to know what makes the viewers not like this movie? I love it, and I doubt I am the only one :). At 13, I memorized many verses of the Bible, and I followed the teachings of the Bible, yet felt "different" because of those teachings. It takes time to "fit in," right? In "Antibellum," I could relate to the hardships faced by the young girl. The overall plot is excellent, and the setting and characters are intriguing. I hope that Alisan Porter will be able to reprise her character in the sequel. The story is enjoyable and inspiring! I never liked it! Fans will undoubtedly consider this movie as a fan favorite, and, as a fan, I was highly dissatisfied. I understand tears occur from either horror movies or unexpected tragic events, but I am simply befuddled about why some people choose to cry so easily, without even having to be sad first! Don't make other people's sadness your own! If you're really concerned about this movie's rating, I strongly urge you to look into your heart! Because reading the comments isn't worth it when you can
Rhames as the art curator. I could've easily watched a whole movie about his character. Zero interest in the film's heroine's journey to get back her father's diamonds to save the family home. Actually I think the plot follows a cliche by making those diamonds seem so valuable. Here I know better than anyone that some diamond is worth 100mil USD. (Just a year ago a jewelry company was robbed in downtown Calgary, Alta for just that and $76 mil USD.) I did enjoy the cameos by musician Brad Paisley and actress Jamie-Lynn Sigler but that can't redeem this film.

don't buy it. Let me explain... White Anglo Saxon Men from the United States of Ameritraila with Beer bellies come and plague female surfers with Zits. The Anglo American men all talk in that prissy hi placato snobby voice that is so boring and annoying. Way to go John Grisham, Wayne Dyer and Vance twenty something cent bill. This is what happens when you have that much money just lying around. Maybe we need a law that says if you purchase ten or six of a specific model of a car you have to at once donate ten to thirty (help them decide) of them to Third World Countries. You have heard the expression, "Let the beer do the talking. " Well when it comes to Phat Beach, that's what it does. It "talks," and it "speaks," and "says" and "prattles" WAY too much. It's about anything happening in San Diego as it pertains to Surfing, and that is darned little, but that's about all that anyone is interested in. The Beer bellied Anglo American dudes talk about foreigners and the locals. Ironically one of the regulars is from Germany. He's the "popular" dude with a hot chica from the Netherlands and it's great to see
. Randy’s favorite movie is “Green Gab Brooks” and we both chuckle every time he does his absurd user’s manual directly to camera. Randy and I are undoubtedly the only people in the world who refer to “Green Gab” as their favorite movie- perhaps ever. That’s what’s so timeless about this movie. How it still holds up after all these years and how generations have embraced this movie as well. It’s timeless. So special. It looks like every horse you’ve grown to love and it stars a man that’s charming but would never check a horse’s teeth. I like the happy endings and Walter Matthau makes it happen. This is The must see movie pure and simple. This movie was a trend setter in the horse movie genre long before people chose calories over carbs. Forget Rotten Tomatoes, The Rotten Tomatoes construct is devoid of any ability to appreciate the actually worth of movies. Tomato’s free and infinite. No worries. They just go with “mascots”. Hard to fit a mascot behind a protocol. Understandable. For the thousands that have enjoyed this movie and thousands to come. Randy and I can’t change the real tome. We can’t change how good this movie was, is, and will continue to be. Trust me this movie isn’t about the
previews it looked like it was a cooking, fun-in-the-sun show. The first episode even showed us arriving on a ferry and headed to Spongeorama factory. Now, the last few minutes of the show they show us on the beach with bar-b-q and the crowd of people indulging. Well we (the chef's) arrive to the beach and are promptly shoved in a little room made for ferries. So we are cooking in the most miserable place you could imagine. Of course by the time we are done we are hailed down by a beautiful man... this means that he wanted to buy something to eat... that is about it. Alright it was a gimmick, but the producers of the show failed to promote the right thing. One big reason the show was held back... I think I met with the wrong person, because if I met with the producer he would have fought against it. He would have looked at all the options and saw it for what it could be as he has experience like I did capturing the audience with the food. But at some point my pre-show meeting was short, and shortly afterwards there was a phone voice mail with his sister who is a tad crazy and only involved in the bottom line... so I forgot talking to him altogether. But we can't let that happen anymore. We need Key West to get this right,
us gather to watch a B-movie, so I needed to put in some serious study time. It's really not that hard to watch...but BAD?!? That's a LOT harder for me. :) LOTS of cheesy acting, dubbing, BAD costumes, BAD script, BAD dialog, BAD everything. It's like that dinner party...oh no, the dessert is made of PB&J, and WTF??!!? LOL! But knowing full well it will probably be hilarious, because we know what we're in for, and it's just another over-indulgence in a birthday month, we go for it!!!!!!!!!! :) That's just how it is.﻿ And, honestly, most of those "bad" movies gave me tons of great topics to write for my blog, so...variety is the spice of life, etc., etc. :) LOL, but who wants to deal with all the bad stuff?? Nah!! Just pick the "good" stuff! :) I just fantasize that one day maybe we have the skills to go back in time and pick all the right stuff. It was always my dream to go back in time, and it still is, but these days I have to think about crowds of nasty Middle Ages types breathing the lice-ridden pl
who takes a stand. I especially like how the Reagan administration (Fairness Doctrine is pitifully represented in the film), political correctness, and the feminist establishment figure into the plot. The movie also includes lots of shots of the mountainous Wichita State campus and a bit of anecdotal, OK journalism history, specifically including a meeting of Kimberly Parker's first housemates from WSU (when did football come in? -- they were a group of women looking for an apartment for September '78). A very good ensemble cast, too. Please don't let it be one of those cases where the theme song renders the user unconscious. One may think twice about the accuracy of the recalled events and situations. Even so, it is a good movie and fun to watch. Another sequel, Miss March, is on its way. -- I marvel at the acerbic powers of Scott Baio in last week's episode (only one left) of this show. Baio's character is having a hard time covering the Aurora Baseball team, the Springfield Majors (think Kansas City game), after writing stories about high-end stores. Baio should have just moved to NYC. Maybe we have different IMDb accounts. Did he look slimmer on the show, in July '82? In 2009 he may still be 8-1

. War can be all consuming to a town as well. Such This movie says to me that we need to celebrate the unsung heroes, the ones who are no longer here like my grandfather who fought in WWI. We also need to realize the harm it causes to those "surviving" the war. How much we take for granted what we have right in front of us. As we spend so much time thinking about those who return and what horrors we have not witnessed we forget that there are human beings behind what we tend to recognize; the guilty, the bad guys. We are consumed thinking about their sides of the story and yet fail to see the blood spilled that demands that red should bleed and nerves should fray. The future is here my friends, come see it. By the way I am not so naive as to overlook the part publicity has as part of war, turning it into spectacle. Can we ignore that? No. But does that let it off the hook? No either. Any way, of course after I watch this movie I wrote a 4 page rant on it in my paper. Nice movie though. See it if you like. It is good. :) And don't be banned for opinion. :P Challenge it on the forum. :) Come for the verbal dissection, stay for the tea. :) All in good fun of course. This movie helped
we have to take as good directing with no redeeming grace. Harriet Harris as the dead daughter’s mother is laughable in her over the top grief and over the top acting and so the list goes on. Sorry… Out of the Blue is a bad movie. A quite bad movie that will not gain anywhere the power of a cult classic among those craving exploitation cinema. It is just well made enough to be a terrible waste of your time and its blatant “point” just apparent not tragi-comic. I just fail to see its point. Besides the basic implication that Shawshank…meh…there is even though, for me, a metaphorical point of rage against the machine though not employed as humour. And while all a prison has to offer at best are assholes that makes the prison a laughing stock, a laughing stock in which some asshole has to live, a laughing stock that might mean longer to live in one’s eternal “Home”, a laughing stock amidst which it is good to know there is a Limbaugh and a Beck. And really, it might some what much worse…a government. But then such a thing is revealed to be a government made up of all such assholes, it is like what Poe would write, a child conceived with the potential of “its mother”, it is a predator or

But most are kind of cheesy. Because the humor is somewhat stupid. Some of it might be a little offensive to younger audiences. So make sure you're thinking about if they can handle it before you let 'em see it. Also, be cautious of this movie as it might cause you to want to jump off of a bridge. But being lecherous is much better. Because that's the best part of this film. The sexual talk. But mostly it's sinister and it's sad. For it's only giving you half the joke. True, it's a nice effort, but it's not all that. Never the less, the laughter was contagious. So laugh on, because there is nothing that can her this. And also, you might want to consider not to try this at home. Although it's ok to try it at school. Amazingly this film puts us not just as people, but also gives us a whung? Laden?  I'm going to watch it again. If you like it great! But I would not recommend it to other people. You'll catch onto the gimmick of the joke fairly quickly, but it's still quite alarming. So keep in mind that it's not humor of the laugh-out-loud kind. It's more tragic than over the
Smith) has made it his business to move in when he learns there are a substantial number of young men locked in with these heartless thugs and hoodlums he vows to free them. Taking advantage of his business associate Alexander T. Pope's (the late, great character actor Clint Eastwood) prison system, Sharpe bribes the warden Sam modern Allen (also the late, great character actor Richard Ward) into allowing himself in (Pope is otherwise opposed to this idea) and moves right in. It's not long however before Sharpe begins to suspect that there's something nefarious going on, when he learns that one of his little-criminal-prodigies was actually tortured and killed by the prisoners he was trying to protect. Sharpe fires up the maple sugaring operation inside the prison to protect the boys and when he realizes that Pope's business dealings and his association with warden Tanner are becoming too cozy, he realizes that his work is far from over. Sharpe has to form alliances with those inside and those outside the prison, if he's going to find out who exactly the baddies are and keep the children safer. Can he do it without compromising his conscience? Ethan Sharpe will be looking for the answer to that question the whole time in this wickedly cruel thriller. The
surprise, he was actually under acting in this movie. (I was thinking he can only be over the top). This movie is what you expect from Luc Besson. Except that this movie is just not too interesting. I liked that Brad Pitt "always" tries to have a clever line no matter what, this was good in this movie. This movie has some good examples of reminders that both sex genders are lazy & that jealousy does drag you down. My rating of 3 stars are only b/c of the good sounds. All in all not bad. Just not really happy or sad, if you get what I mean. But this moves makes good use of the omelette style of moviemaking.

something from the bottom of one of those guys with blood leakage problems vapor takes every now and again. The cover makes it look, at most, unwatchable. But just when you think you’ll like a horror movie with 20 cast members it turns out to be a load of shit. You’d think at some point you’d get some up front that it wouldn’t be a 90 minute collection of coincidences or contrivances but you know what? You don’t get that point. For a long time. You don’t expect much from any new horror movie. They all look like they have half a budged and a charisma vaccuum. Okay? But some of ’em look apart from little things. Filled with ideas and interesting faces. This isn’t one of those. In fact it looks more and more like a case where someone edited in with a little luck in an attempt to make it look good. Sure there’s no shoutouts to a guy throwing shit at a wall or cut to a failure of an electric car and a bunch of random shots of vapor or bloood. Not that I mind. It’s just not my kind of film. Misters. Maybe if you want to see a movie about blood leaves that just add a tiny bit of weird towards the end. I would recommend you look at something else. Like some old zombie
sexually dominate the natural looking beautiful brunette part-time actress/pin-up/high functioning alcoholic. Am I losing you here? Well, season 7, episode 9 of Breaking Bad, “Blood Money,” has some of the lasting imagery of plot threads leading up to this point in the series that I’ve had in a while. It also features a bit of a make-good by a writer who faces similar complaints. Let’s discuss. The title is inspired by the scene where Walter confronts Jesse about the whereabouts of the tainted money. Jesse is hiding out in his mother’s house near Greyhound bus terminal, homeless, broke and beginning alcohol rehab. “Money is the root of all evil,” his Mother decides to not let her son know about the money. “Uncle Bob got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and started leaving money on the street. I would put it in my purse, but it felt wrong.” This scene also represents a somber scene where the audience hears the first time in the series explanations as to how Jesse’s mother died. Despite this sad turn of events, in passing on the tainted money, Marie not only saves Jesse’s life, but she also leads him down the road that will result in his death. Certainly her choice was not made for
something more out of this movie. In fact, I find myself returning to it, seagull style. It’s a laugh out loud kind of film and a cornucopia of slapstick. However, deep in its tone is a powerful message, a hidden lesson about life and the choices we make for ourselves and the consequences of said choices. I think one of the strongest lessons I have ever learned about sin is when Jesus told the crowd that He would uplift whoever would lay hold on his hand, but that they had to let go at some point. That’s the crux of this movie. It takes the cartoon humour and adds a second dimension to the story in a way that Christ does when he meditates on the mountain with his disciples and contemplates what it is to give up absolutely everything. The character of Boo becomes the Christ figure of the movie, a sacrificial lamb whose role is to demonstrate and explain to his audience what this Jesus guy was talking about. Here the lesson is not anger, so intense and high that anything less than a miracle is disappointing. Instead, it’s the power of love over hate, forgiveness over vengeance, gentleness over superiority. Painful and beautiful all at once. And what is even better is how we are given spiritual and practical tools in each episode to take with us in our own walk
it just had stereotypes and stupid dialogue. I tried not to give the film away too much but it's a male dominated puplic space where marines go on daring missions with little thinking what could happen. It surely isn't even interested in women as this was an insult to their intelligence. There's got to be robot attacks and a really bad chase in a subway and much more, just to imagine. I don't understand, but this is not the first time there was a chance for a something better but everything was looted out with stereotypes. I really wanted the film to impress but I'm just angry. I will not give this a second chance, in fact a film which has a director and writer like this. .. good idea? Come on, these are far from good. Sorry, that sounded too critical. There is in fact action, but feels right out of a porno movie and stupid. It's like you work for these men right from the beginning so it's supposed to be good, the first impression is valid on the rest till the end. Please check it out, the Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev did a slice of life film about incest and that was good, but the next movie.. I'll see what else was good and maybe write about it.. I don't know. That isn't even the production design but something
trilogy (Latcho Drom, 1994, and Ça commence aujourd'hui , 2001), Motorcycle Diaries: Europe comes at a strange and momentous time. It is not an avant-garde film that can be praised for it's formal ingenuity or experimentation, nor is it a conventional produced narrative feature. Rather it is a fantastic yarn that is more at home in the talking-head, documentary style of film we normally associate with television. Gatlif's work is a rare thing: It is the moving picture equivalent of a tune; a song too beautiful to be forgotten, a song that puts it's listeners in a good mood, and reminds them that perhaps life is not all that bad. It is currently one of the few movies being produced today that deserve the name "Hollywood." I can hear the faint voices in the backroom, screaming that that statement is a sacrilege, but it is very true. In fact the rest of the country has about a 41 percent chance of actually being converted to the glorious art form that is called film, if they saw Motorcycle Diaries: Europe. And with all sensitivity and sleight of hand, I must say that Mr. Romain Gatlain has redeemed himself in only three mere hours. We ought to forget about
