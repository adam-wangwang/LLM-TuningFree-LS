such. For this audience it is well made, lush and pleasant. However, I had a number of thoughts about the storyline’d narrative of the movie that may speak to the more than female audience. The movie is a remix on the storyline from Wutheruing Heitcliffe with enough twill to make a quilting guilde happy for decades. This is the story about a dying matron of the 40’shousehold living her last day of memory of the evening she meets a man on the evening she met him 40years before. In the present she is trying to understand what that ‘evning meant in light of her impending death. The evening in the past is a mix between a girlish fun and a bit of a tramp. After a long drive to their destination, she does fall asleep in his car with a make out session, but there is not the clearer indication if it went further. She does come back to tell about it and doesnt show up for a sleepover with the friends. To this day, she recalls she has some regret that she did not stay the over and keep the confidence. The friend does not blame Lulu and this brings out the idea that Lulu may have let herself down more so then the friend. The man himself was an upper crust family man with a son. It was very clear that he was married with children. It is up the audience to
an indy movie budget is astounds. As a fellow filmmaker, I am in complete and awe of what was done here. From start to end, there are some beautifully shot scenes, and it tells it’sm story in a very unique way that many will appreciate at least. The idea behind the film is brilliant and the acting throughout the film is really well thought. There is the odd moment the acting is not what I expected from this film. The problem that lies with this film is its length. I watched a rough cut months ago and the run time then could have probably been cut down by a good forty minutes. However this was not the cast and the editing, but the direction who decided that this was not enough, but they also decided to include what they had, even when you could tell they might not have had that much footage to make this film. I would recommend this but there really is not much worth paying for it for. It’s a really good film if you like independent cinema. Otherwise you might not find anything interesting in this film at all. But I mean if you have nothing better, give the trailer a watch and if you like what it looks like, then go for t. It might not blow you aways, because if you are expecting something to impress you, then your going for the entirely wrong film. But if you like it then you might like it more than most. It’s a film I feel is going nowhere
does NOT disappoint!!!! It really is very close in look and feel to those earlier games. The game starts with your character being on the ground with a gun by your left side and a grenade in your right hand. You quickly realise you weren't part of the army that has just launched an attack on a town in Colombia, and that your comrade, your partner has just been killed. The next scene has you in your first person role running like a scaldy dog through the area, you quickly realise that you have been shot, the bullets going through your crotch!! Ouch!!! That seems right!! You spend the early stages of this episode trying not to die of blood loss, and at the same running to find some medical care, to try to salvaged what is in your legs. Through all this may-hem your are trying desperately not be blown up by the army (your enemy), who have just started dropping bombs in the town and your partner who has been shot tells you "If you'd just stop running, they're not shooting at me!" The mission is set and it is then your job to survive against the odds and kill the bad guys. There is more than one way of doing this, but for a newbie like myself there is one way and one way only. I like it and I'll stick with. Just because someone said something "new and different", doesn;'t mean I have to do it. Anyway
England, the opening 5 minutes set the tone for much what’s to unfold – with some wonderfully gnawed corpsicles being hunted by a pair of dogged private, and the grisly discovery of one corpulent corpse stuffed almost to bursting with a variety of sharp weapons and other assortments of parafnilia. When the lead female cop (AnneHeyland) is called upon by police superior to investigate the case is when we really are introduced to our cast of characters, and the motives of the killer. Suffice to say, Ms. Heneyland’s character – and pretty damn fine character it be – doesnt make things easy for her. With a solid cast, some nifty murder set-piecies and some nicely frantic camera set-up’s, this one is recommended, and not overly horrid to find. Not a major work by any stretch but it be worth checking this one out if such things tickles your fancy – for me, it’ll be nice addtion to my collection, no doubt, and to see the man who brought us Fulca’s infamouse Zombie Flesh eaters cut his director teeth on something so delirously fun. 7, 2018 Rating 3 & half bearded apes out of 5.

Newton at least 2 weeks after he was born.  I cannot see this 9+ months-being away kind of behavior for someone who was around all the way through the pregnancy, was there for labor and delivery and saw the baby 3 days after they were discharge. That really bothers, nags and gawds me to no end.  I think something like that would be almost impossible for most parents to miss especially one that was there when the labor and delivery were ongoing for 6 days and 9 + months pregnancy and labor/birth prep. I find these kind of behaviors really really odd.  But I know things get distorted and warped after time has eloped the better and greater part of the story is left untold by the ones who really hold a place of truth and accountability over the events.  They use people by using a selective story telling technique and leaving out the damning evidence/details out of the picture.  I am just specifying and calling attention to an observation I have noticed regarding the comments that are being made by some who were close and know better than to make such comments.   I find the pattern just a little too odd in nature.  Odd = inexpedient and contrary to what is established = bad.  Now let’’s go have lunch.  🙂  Loving it all.   So many thanks for the support.  I truly have the greatest supporters, friends and

tonight. The ‘Beast from The East’ has caused chaos for cinems across Lancaster, Preston and Barrow. We had quite literally a minus 12 windchil. I drove in to the office, but there was no way I was going out in the night, so I took a look back at my 25th blog. That gave me the idea to have “BLOG-TENNACOLA’ from now on, which means, every tenth week I’ll take the last blog as inspiration for my next one. No more 125-word challenges. Instead I will just reflect. But this week we’ll look back one blog back to see what I got up to. Read my blog here https://bit.do /blog-10-chocolate and the below blog. Remember you are in a world where my memories are as fresh on the page as they were one year ago. Have another look at Choc-full with teddy to remember what I got myself in to. https://bit-dot/blog10-cocco – also look back in this blog in December and watch for the first time, if you hadn’t before, the very entertaining Teddy-Hazel video https://bit.dot/teddyteddyhazelelvis.

best one. It’s the first episode of a TV series, for example, where there are usually high hopes and expectations for the follow-ups. But that was not the case with Star Wars, where George Luc’as’ first movie was a low budget little thing and, well… pretty mediocre and unwatchable. Lucas kept getting more money for each sequel he did and he got better and better each time at writing and making movies. But it’d seem his movies’ budget is going up exponentiationally with each sequal he makes. This one, at over $30 million, is 16 (!!!! times more expensive to film than A Star Is Born was). And I’m sure someone figured that out and said to George, look, we’ve put a lot of money into these other movies, and now it will be time to get your money’ s worth and take some risks. For one thing, as you can see, the music is by John Williams, who also scored the first two features. But this one has a special guest: Bee Gee Robin Williams. (Incidental note: the man who did this sound for Empire Strik Back was sounding very much out of his depth in the Star Wars episode he did.) This episode is actually a pretty good example, for those who might be new to the series, and are wondering wot the fuck they are all doing, to wit, which
that brings..." - you know, the "Nip/Tuck", etc... I guess they don`t have any "in-their-own" pitch to go with their films. The one thing I hear around here (and I think it may be the same as in LATimes) is that it`s not so much a movie, but rather a TV show. I agree, I don`think "Cor" works as movie and can imagine it having been on TV for at least a season. The plot is kinda slow and I didn`t find the characters interesting and capturable(?). At some moments it got a bit boring, but I did watch the flick to the very ending. I agree with comments on this board saying that the movie has more in it than meets the first eye(?), but I didn`to find all of it. I`ll try getting the DVD (it has very good production value and it`s beautiful to watch), but don't know if I`ll watch "Cor" for a 2, 2nd time (except for the purpose checking how much I can get out off it). Maybe I`d better skip the 2nd viewing . Maybe I`ll watch the whole thing again only after reading the book. (BTW, I haven`th read the book yet, didn`.`t even know about it until after seeing "C". Will look for the book now.

the new boss of the Hong Kong triads. The candidates are Wo Hop, Siu Kwai, and Cheung. But before this, there are some other things that must happen to get to that point. Tri-ads don’t like to take chances so they do whatever they have planned to ensure the election goes off as they think it ought to. I don’ think I could do justice if I tell the story, so please download the movie. I do feel the need for a disclaimer just as I had for Chung Hoon City though. Do not get the confused with Chan-Woo and Chung-Wo. The former is a Korean actor, the later is a Chinese director from Hong Kong. The reason for the confusion with the two is because they seem so similar to me that I used their Chinese versions in the above sentence. This movie stars Simon Yuen, Dean Sheksman or Cheung Jing. Dean Shek was also in the popular “Sword of Justice” and later went to Hollywood. He star in “Rush Hour 3”, “Sword of the Legion”, “Kill Bill” and “Rise to Honor.” There are several other actors that are famous to me who also appear, but the one that caught the biggest of my attention is Lo Meng. He played the leader in the movie Chan Wo, but here he is just one gangster. The movie is quite excellent and if
particularly since so many of our more popular blockbusters are based on comic striips or graphic novel series. But with Brown and Harvard we are met with something more a laudary. There are no explosions. There are almost barely any conflicts to be found. And yet Brown and Harvard remains somehow a powerful movie and a movie that stays with this review for quite a long while following its viewing. Therein lies its appeal. It is a very real character study with an element of comedy that borders on the languor of mirth. The jokes are never really loud enough that you jump, but you definitely smile. You may be a bit bemuddled or confused at the beginning of this very unconvenitonable movie, but I warn you, keep with things and see it to its delightfully unambiguous end – because that ending is a hell of a dooly from which to tie up a neat and pleasant little bow around this odd, odd film. There’s a great sense of humanity to this film, and a great appreciation for the beauty of the human condition, our peculiarities, little quirks and even our weaknesses, which is wonder to behbld and a great joy. It all makes for something that is very much a movie about nothing, but that has a lot to say. In that, Brown and Harvey, while not one of Daniel Day Lewis’s best movies, perhaps will be one of my favorite. It’ so
Wonders that were released in 1926. This does not make much sense but it is true nonetheless! The film is a 50 minute romantic drama starring the future Hollywood stars Norma Sheerer and Ramón Novarre, who made the film whilst their new spousal relationship was developing (they were married from March to November 1927 and never had a chance at being a normal couple considering they were both major stars). We are talking seriously legendary stars here, two that made their mark in their field. Their marriage was to the advantage of both: Shearer had finally found a new star to take the place that Conrad N. Hilton had left since he had retired and Ramos Novaro was given the opportunity he had been waiting for years. With a couple as big as this, MGM were aiming for a great success and that is what they had. In France, the country where all the romos and melodramas took place (Les Vampires was a film that was made as an adventure film but got stuck as horror when released in France) Ramón became a heart throb, a sensation, a megastar. But the French audience never felt a drop of sympathy for Norm’ she was a villian in all the movies released in France. Still today people in Paris will say “Cette Normandes, je ne la support pas!” (“That Norah- she really pisses on

released in the US to really figure out why I had remembered them the way i had. And upon further inspection I realized my error in these events. Well in actuality, my brain was operating without my full conscious thought, remembering and putting these pieces together all wrong due a to event I thought happened first, had actually taken place before it. Confusion much?. Here’s a quick run through of the episodes: Fugitives (Nov.14/ 22,1991), Shadow Play (20/28/11/18/25/27 & Jan21,17/19/92), Ménage A Trio (Feb1 & 2/5 & 8/Fev11/13 &17 & 92), Invisible Girl II (February 24/28,1992) and Dream House (March 2/7, 9, 1992) You may be familiar with these episode as much of these stories have gone on in the new version. But the thing is most of these stories had been told much earlier and in most cases they were completely re-imagines, rework, sometimes even reboots of much earlier stories. I will go through them one by one but I would love to hear your thoughts on how you remember these episodes and if you agree with mine? So
how hard life must really ‘be’ when you are living in a capitalist society. The only ‘real people’ in UK cinema appear in independent movies about the working class, usually when it is about social issues. The real people are unempolyed and all over social services. The real actors and musicians in a movie may as well be alumni of the University Of London on a stroll through Notten Hill markets. The real people in the movies never get to become the actors, they are there only for the characters to point at and make a scene about. To reinforce how difficult it is to live in the capital of the most over bloated imperial oppression ever seen on earth and to be so utterly discontent with your life. If you can’ t go to university or sing that you have suffered enough and have a degree then your voice will never get heard. The mainstream movies all have one, two, maybe three characters with some working- class credentials because that is what has become the new definition working-class, those who can relate to how much you are suffering and are trying to survive by working 3 or 4 minimum wage jobs. It is the same sort definition of ‘upper class’ that is used in Britain. Anyone not on the university circuit is working class and anyone in the arts with a degree or even just an A levels (equivilance of the first year at a University, or the first two years at a College in the US college systems

to sobs. To see that little boy walk across the stage and sing “i love my teacher” just did it. And did you notice that a lot of things that were really true were things that the teacher would say to him, and that, like being lost in fantasy land, would give that little boy the strength, the courage to keep doing what he was really there to be doing? There is a lot in this little movie for everyone to think over. “Just do this. Do that.” (to himself) but when his little brother has the same problem he helps him out. And when the little boy gets up and says “We’re all special.” you really feel it when he has to go through “some difficult things” on his way home. I give this movie an 8 for being true and a B+. 🙂 🙂 🙂 That’s what I call a good time at a theater or at home. Great, simple story that makes a point and does it in a wonderful way. You have never seen a movie like it. I hope I’m not being naive. I hope you never do either, but if anything, I hope the people who write the movie like it are watching this movie as well. 🙂 🙂 I give it a 7.7, but I’m just saying that there’ll never be a movie so moving as this wonderful movie has been. 8-7 for me. This
a bit lackadaisical in the first replica cuffs hours, so the film can be confusing. When they settle down to play, the story lines come home. Although the costuming is not always of great quality, I felt that the actors were all adequate. It is interesting to note that the filmmakers have chosen to stay with the "Iliad" story where Jason is the central character, and Odysseus plays a much lesser role, which is more true to the classics, but does not please those who know the Disney version. All the other familiar characters we know from the previous films are here as usual to add spice, with a new character added to replace the deceases Heracles, a man named Athenos (playwright Rostand) and the new leader. In this film Jason and his crew do come home to find all is well and a glorious reunion. A bit slower than the others in this era, but better than Medea. Highlights included the musical entertainment, the scenes in the woods where one of my favorite characters, the cyclops Polyphenemous, gives Odyssey a wonderful musical tune "The Dancing Cyclopes". He reminds me very much of a large, cuddly puppy, which is why I love him in this film. Also the fight scene between the crew and a group cows. And all of the entertainment leading to the wedding of Medea and Jason, including

the 2005 version, characters from the original reappeared as computer animated beings in a live action environment, and there were cameo appearances from actors who were in both the cartoons (and Howard in the flesh) and live action version (a few were in the original movie). My favorite cameos included Tony Randal and John C. Riels who were in both original versions. Though I loved Anthony Hopkin in anything he does (yes I have enjoyed his Hitler bits), he was the wrong choice to play the villain Grimlock. He was too old (he was in is 6Os) for this type of villlian (but, oh, sooo goood to look and sound sooo much like his Nazi film in “The Boys From Braham”). I enjoyed the animation, but it was used too often in the movie, which made Howard’s attempt at a 100% digitally created feature seem all wrong. The “live action” shots were done using actors with masks under their heads to similate the original animation. I think (and hope if it is brought back) they should make 98.52387% digitally animated and keep all the real actors faces (since Howard tried to make the movie for kids and adults), and maybe for adults and real animal action (although the cartoon animals were a delight in the original). Also for Grimslok, maybe make a
reading each and every part of the series, but this is such garbage after reading the first book, Harry. The first book was absolutely the best, but the second book is just filled crap, and then the next to follow. The first of the Harry books was really good and had me at hook. I actually enjoyed it so much, I didn't even mind the filler of chapter twenty-three. That chapter was pretty cool and the only thing of the book that I felt had something worth reading. It is the second book that I enjoyed it more and more, but then the rest of it was just awful. I feel really sad that they made the decision not follow that wonderful first installment of Harry Potters. It was so amazing and interesting. I am so disappointed, and it made it worse after I read the second part. It didn’t add up to much, and I was not at all excited to read those other books. I think that the series has become the equivalent to a fantasy, because it has made the characters into cartoonish stereotype of people, I mean it is a complete fantasy of a world that does not really exist and that they have made characters like Harry, Ron, Ginny, Luna... This is the same kind http://paulmurakamiexecutivesearchagency12.unav.educationcouncil.ca of story that should exist in the comic book section, because they
of crap anything more then 6 deserves a punch in da face. The movie is basically all about 3 idiots trying ta to rob da bank, which I guess is okay but the movie is really about how they try to get in the vault and that takes about half an hr when it should take about 1min. And the main problem is, I think there were about 2 minutes worth a plot in this movie and the rest is just fill. The plot just gets really really old, really quick and most of this movie just consistsa random stuff in da woods, which I guess is okay but the part that kills me. The part where they show you what da movie is about at da end. So if there is one thing I can be thankin for this whole movie is that da last minute or two where the plot actually get put back into da picture, da ending isn` actually that good but after 95 minuts of crap, its somethin thats nice ta see, so my advice is if you ever think about watchin this pile of crap, for one dont do that and if ya still want to watch this movie watch da last mintue or to of da movie and I promise you that is where this movies plot its at, and if ya still have da time for 2 full hours watch da shit and have fun but this movie deserves its rating of 3/1.. just in case you want me ta review a movie that deserves a good
doesn’t get a good job because a guy named George who works at the store in the middletown malls has the same resume as him and got a job in the office of a rich business man. George and Joe don’t like that job at the mall so they plot each other’e lives. George says Joe is taking money at the car wash and he washes it off. Joe puts some oil in George's coffee at the restaurant and George gets fired. Joe gets revenge by putting some gas on the ground at the garage as a car ran on it and George nearly got fired for putting gasoline in one customer's car and the customers blames George for putting the gasoline in the oil. Joe's plan worked. As someone, Jim the owner, goes to a meeting with these employees and someone came up with one idea. George got fired for not letting Joe having a good career. Finally, they made it. Joe got a good career. He thanks George for all he did for Joe. He has a good and happy life with Jane and the kid finally got a good dad. As they go up the elevator. It was a job well down by one guy. Even they did something bad, Joe did a stupid pranks for Joe to succeed in life. If no Joe, he wouldn’t get a job. Joe’f good cause they've always done something bad in their whole entire live including they were kids and got
actors. We do not need any more American films. We have them aghghor by time, and this is another mediocritie.. I do wish we could boycott this film, but too much water had gone under that bridge. It took me until after the break (and me not giving up as some friends did) to have any desire to watch it. They showed the opening scene when I left the restaurant, because I'm not into action movies. The first scene is a sort-after scene, if it'd be a good movie. I waited through it 2 hours and 15 mns. to find out what happened between the first shot and today. That's bad, very bad: the whole script is on a single page. I was very disappointed and bored. The idea is good, but the execution is horrible. Terribly inappropriately used actors. There is NO CONSISTENCY. Why did the bad guys turn good, and how could the police-man with 19,076 unresolved files be such a good man, and then again, the good bad guy turned good to the bad bad guy before he kills him? When did the bad guy turn bad? You never tell. No, I couldn’ think why the guy who plays the policeman with the 27,785 unresolved cases is supposed not be too bright? His hair is too long, his clothes are too
eke out any positives except for a neat twist. When a story starts off in the 70´, is about love, hate and revenge, involves an evil dictatior and the fall of a mightly empire, how can you say it'´s average? Well, you can. Because it is. The story, the characters, the settings. You can forgive these as they are part of a larger whole. But the storyteller is on holiday, not in this film. The screenwriters seem to have left themselves home, they didn´ve been able to put any emotional edge or back-story on any character or event, and, on several occation a plot-point is introduced, only 6 minutes after it have been solved. The dialogue seems to have be run trough a randomizing text editor, to ensure the most boring possible conversations. But worst of all, the actors seems bored to death. It'´ just a shame really, because without the actors a 1½ hour long, rather dull talking-and -lying to your face scene simply won.not be nearly so unbearably boring, as this one is..Apart.from that, the picture on the screen is beautiful, shot in great locations with good cinemaphotography and good cg-effects. And with a soundtrack that fits perfectly. But I have to hand in my review card, the film just simply isn´t good,
film that i recall. it'll never be high on anyone else list but it really is an undiscovered gem. i've watched it many times over - not as much as say sayonary zacharia, the man who planted trees, or little budda of happiness though not far behind. this movie is a great slice from the late nineteen eightess and early nineties when many people were thinking about how their youthful years were spent and how little of their idealism had actually changed their adult lives. the plot is a bit obvious but is well done. the acting believably sad. and the soundtrack is great if 10000 reasons for wind is the best thing going for something then the director isnt losing an edge. there are a few funny moments but it is not meant as comedy. the cinamatography shows the characters emotions well and the director obviously loves his actors. it really shows in the movies as the actors really give a good performance as well (i mean really, who else on the cast of this could i stand to watch on screen much longer other then ackroyd?). finally it is shot in montreal and has a bit more atmosphere of the city back in the day then the recent one (dumont's life of a killer) or the earlier one from reznor. it is on my list of films to watch again soon as i enjoyed those 150 minutes so
so terrible, and the whole stupid story is so not worth anybody's time. To be fair, i do like Daryl Sabara (Danny).

initials are R&R. Oh, wait, this was also a rock video. Forget it. In an even more forgetful film, five young, well-bodied things (Vivienne McKay from Neighh-negs; Gavin Mac Leod; a couple of the guys who used to be on Home &amp Away; the bimbonic daughter of a TV news anchor) get strung out on something called K, the latest designer street drug that can only hit the big-time on the set of a low-budget Australian drug movie.<br/><br/>It\'s the same story over and again as the gang hit one drug joint after the other, all different, all identical, and as the film hits its 90 minute mark, most of them have died in their beds because they stopped going to the frickin&#39; hospital.<b>(r)Michael Smith</b><h2>(r)55/100, 2.3/5</b><br/><font color=blue>Review source:www.urbancinefille.</p> <b>(F#75) CAPITAN (1996)</font>(15)   <font face="Verdanar" color="#03030D" size = "4"><p>Captain is a scandalous
movie, simply because he couldn’t take the gore, or the language. It appears that he also has anger issues (not to mention an obvious hatred for movies of the genre), and he’s clearly not a fan. He obviously had an agenda. In contrast, as you’ll see in this review: I’m a total fan of the whole horror genre. Also I’m of the opinion it’d be rude not review the movie properly, it’s like someone going into a sushi restaurant and saying “I don‘a like fish, so it’s gonna be rubbhish“… You get the point. I say, review it without bias, and judge it based upon it merants, and it‘s own genre. Read to my take on The Devil‘s Reject, and decide yourself if it lives down or up to your expectations. But I can almost guarantee whats coming is not going to be like other reviews you’ve read. Enjoy. And you’re welcome. 🙂 Let‘s get down to the nitch – the reason I give this movie 2/5 stars. Why do I deserve to be punched for a horrible, offensive, racist movie that is just so damn horrible, and does nothing but disgust the hell out of you? Let‘a have a look at the facts. … Firstly, I do not believe the director intended to be racist. He simply showed what people
sense in any regular fashion, and it will not be enjoyed by most people you invite over, but the film itself has been met with much critical appreciation. It is really weird, yet intriguing at times. It is somewhat of a "love-it-hate it" kind deal. In fact the "love it" team far outweighs those of the "hate-itters" (I just coined that phrase b.t.w.) and it is no longer a cult-only hit. We know that, because it just came back into the movie house yesterday to show again. And it has also gotten more popular on the Net, though not in the more popular fora. This is mostly due to the intriguynessed, but it is mostly because there hasn? ? there just isn?? ? there is no other movie like "Mother" and there isn?? ? there might just as well be other movies like "Birth" directed only at the "love it or hate-it" team. It isn?? ? there was, of that I?? ? I don?? ?? "Birth". That movie has certainly gathered and kept its audience. How could ? How can ? it can ! How did the directors do that ? How ? how ? how could they do ? well actually "do"; well, now all the directors do is "be" and as long as we are there watching we, too, will be "there"
a serious, “moving” movie about divorce. But divorce isn' t the only thing that couples can't just walk back. There's no way to divorce yourself out from under your baby; like a tattoo on the forehead, parenthalood is a responsibility that must last until you die (which is, it turns our ironically enough -- the only way you get out from under it). Because divorce ends relationships, children are often shunted back-stage. "Kramber vs. A Divore" is a prime exemplum of this movie-making menta. A couple splits up and gets supeudo-crazy. They want to get even, or feel sorry fro each others' feelings. The children, who are caught up (and caught) by the whole thing become bit players for the adults to use to get at each-ther. It is so painful a state that it must not be looked at; certainly no one daring to look at it closely will dare make a movie about the process of getting a divorce -- at its least, because it would be too painful to look back, for the parents themselves, and too ugly for them, at the time it was going on, or, at its worst, lest their children grow to hate and resent them if they ever learn what their own parents' parents' did because they were angry at having to have a second job to live on or any of the other myriad reasons
itself is based off of stereotypes. Some people may find this offensive, but I hope that everyone with any sense or humor at all will understand that this movie was made to be a satirical parody piece of cinemagraph. This film will hopefully shed insight on the realities that exist in our day to day lives. This movie is a reflection not only a reflection on the lives of those in the entertainment and cinema industries but a commentary on the life we know today. I hope you appreciate this film, and understand how much this movie means to all of those involved. ************************** I do not own anything but the credit of directing, producing a writing of the film itself, nor the making of it, these rights to all music, images, logos and copyrights belong exclusively and wholy too those companies who create these things or their respective owners.

The film is entitled, ''Ape Films Pres.-Parody Movie: ''Fame'' (Remade)'. This is a reworking and parody remake based off of a classic 80's film that many of you are already familiar with in hopes you may enjoy having a different point a view of the world we live through the way that is.

’s character: “Bill Miller”, I thought this might be something good. Well, it was, quite. I can not really remember what the movie was all about, just the main message that I want to share. “Keep looking up!”. That’s exactly my mantra, it makes a difference, I believe. Some others might say the movie isn’ t a real classic (and not even one for a comedy…). I don ’t know if it’ll ever get a spot in a Best of the Year-list. One thing I’d guarantee is that it’ll put a smile to your dial, though! I had a good time enjoying it. Anyway, with just a couple thousand hits on IMdb I should at least mention an under-rated flick that really is amusing. Watch it and see if you agree with my view. 😉 Paul’ I like everything about her:…The funny, the funny.” Bill: And the sad. What’ Bill really wanted to do was to be a doctor. But at med school he didn ’t pass his courses and decided, instead, for a Ph. D. in physics, which was a success from his perspective. But then came a marriage, which didn’ work, a divorce, etc. Finally he lost everything that he cherished except for his two sons.

) paid those days.  A lot of the UK press attention  in the 18 months leading up to the BBS was on her, because she was seen as a 'top' attraction.  The reality was that she turned to dust on the BBS stage from Day 1, and barely left her tent. It transfixed the Sun'& News (who between then & BBS had paid a lot of attention on both) and led to her infamous description of the BBS as 'WoodStock 2'.    This interview shows the full story.  I was with her manager & her 'publicist' - the UK rep from her PR firm - much less then 24 hours before her BSB debut (when we were in the tent). She was so high & hyper that she took a taxi straight to the airport after the show, to get out.  What you see in the clip in the TV studio, was what went on in her dressing room.   The publicist did her job on her knees before the UK media,  just to get them to stop talking.  DERKER! It's also clear in the clip that Diane Mantougde-Burton's head had been well & tru-lly  turned -  she loved the Sun, she loved the tabloids, she was their  'friend.  Not that she had a clue what Bo DEREK
long and way boring so here're only my thoughts on two episodes of Bleach, episode twelve and thirteen of Zankou no Mokkai. I love Mokkay as it'd be more appropriate if it was his nickname. He just gives me feels. So, without any further adou, here are the only two episodes we're going to be reviewin:12. Aikyou wa Jitsushin: You'ld Be Crying if it's TrueThe first episode starts off with two new characters, Sakuo Hitsugaya, and Sakuhi Unohana. I love both characters for differing reasons. Hitsuyagaya is hot. That'sd all I need to say. Seriosuly, I can't help my self. He has no choice but top look good with that huge fan he uses as his shinigmamu weapon! On the othe hand Unonana is great. She seems to be the second female character that can actually beat a full born arrancar. She'll probably not have any problems with the visored. Now there are only two fullborn arrancar (unless I missed some of them) in his arsenal, the third was a fullborn in the first episode and got beaten down by one of Ichgo'sd friends. I also have a feelin Maka can take down Yorch too. Then
unless perhaps you are also a former band kid. In fact I really almost didn’T expect to even like BAND SLIPPER PROM! My wife had rent it, though, and suggested I take a look at least. To say I did like this film would probably seem a bit odd to anyone else, but as a former marching and stage member of the high schools marchin" Dukes of Destiny, I found the movie’s title a little confusing. A sliipper prom is an event that normally occurs after the high school formal when kids walk into a party barefoot, usually in their regular street clothes (hences the nickname "slippers" as it was a part to slip in and have some extra fun.". What the movie was about was a group, THE CHICKEN LITTLE CLOWNS, putting on their first play for the school and the way it impacts the members: a trumpeter, a clarinetist, a bari sax, a tumnbler and a mellie. How this is going to play out is a bit unclear at first, but the main storyline is basically that some things will either break you or make the stronger. The characters are quite well done: the clarinetists’ overprotectiveness of the trumpeter, who just wants to be taken for granted as a musician. The bari saxs frustration with his lack and opportunity to solo and the
at a certain target audience, but I can’ t really get why. It probably started out as a family movie, but I haven t seen any sign of that intended audience. Not with the jokes, the vulgarity or a general feeling that kids would particularly like this film. We re told we are in for 90% comedy, so all this is ok by my books and in the end you will have to decide for yourself if the film is good enough for you. I liked the main characters and even if they are not portraying themselves in the best possible light they still seem to be a likable kind of people. No matter how they get there these are in need of a change, and this film shows some of us are more successful than most and the others are much more likely to end their lives in a pool full with the worst and most disgustingly looking aliens possible, which gives this film an extra value. The aleriens seem a bit out-dated nowadays and the design is pretty mediëvel, like nothing one would encounter in todays science-fictie. This isn ’t a bad film nor a great one, but when you don ’ get your expectations right it won t make you happy. So if your are looking for a little comedy or an original idea I would advice you to check out this film. But beware for some truly distastefull sequences which are so disgustingly that they might stay inside my memory.
attention and help for his partner, the equally talented and equally attractive Frank McBain (Emily Mortimar). He also works with an eccentric hacker (Carla Gugs), and a young recruit named Nico (Craige Sinkfield). We know this because even though the plot is barely explained, the dialogue is so bad, you think it does. You’e going through the motes of reading subtitles before realizing there are no sub-text in the text. The dialogs are just a lot of empty words, but they did manage something very clever: to make us feel like watching a movie when watching the movie. What is going on, why are we here, and how do I leave? That’s the point when I was wondering if this was the first episode because I have watched episodes one and eight and they are nearly identical to this one. It’a no more than a two parter, so I guess we’re on the same page here. No one seemed to be enjoying themselves, so I’m just going to move along. The final sequence is very, if not worse, a cheap copy of the first “Star Wars” movie, so just to get that comparison out the window. It has no story arch, no conflict, no real pay off, only a bunch of scenes and words, with no real meaning to them except to waste your time. They’re not funny, they’’ just
character of the children entirely. This movie also completely changes the point and reason for it’ s popularity. I’ll admit I haven’T read this specific one but the summary I’m about to review is also different. So, this film is about three siblings in the 80ies who are on a camping trip in northern Washington. Things go wrong with their family vehicle and they end out in a remote area where they meet a man who is obsessed with Bigfoot and he invents a “trap” they can put Big foot inside and then he will sell it or put on display in a zoon. One kid (Kyle) seems to be a Bigfoot, he can climb trees like a animal and he is obsessed (more so that the other two) about catching Big foot (maybe because he is half-Bigfoot?) He is also more reckles with this obcession. Anyway I haven the impression this movie was made as an excuse to make a Bigfoot movie, and they did not bother with the book series. Nope, not even once. They just completely changed the story. How do I know so much? One, people on the internet are saying this and two I read the story online to see if it was even about children. It was, not that there is anything particular wrong about having a book about children, but these changes I find pretty pointless and stupid. I was so disappointed with this movie because I think
action starts in Cuba with the US involvement that led Khrsuchev to believe that American coercion against the Cuban revolution would be accepted. In a misguide attempt he then allows the world to be divided between the super-powers during an era of cold war. Condon takes little pleasure however in exploring this theme much further, instead optic to move onto a fictionalised account of what occurred around Bobby Kennedays assassination and the possibility this was planned. He brings the story up to date with the impending American election in 1788. The problem with books that tackle this subject is if your reader is a fan they already know the answers but if they don\t know the answers, you end up putting all your readers to their heads wondering where this story will take them. The story is a little disheveled. The language very 1780s with little or nothing having stood out in 2012. A wasted opportunity to look at this fascinating subject matter and leave little knowledgeable to the reader. I give this 5/18/12 for the attempt even at making a story out a jumble. My first Richard Condo’ but definatly my Last! Condon is one of those writers who were a big splach all over 1969 but never made it out of the 1969’ decade. He is clearly a writer who likes to explore
Lord’of The rings. It does have a few flaws, but it is still the best fantasy epic ever written. Lord Of The RIngs was published between 22 and the 29th of July 60 years ago. Now, as a huge fan I will begin with the plot. “It is a strange thing to come home after long years of wandering” This was the words said by Frodo as the book starts off with his journey. LordOfThe RIngs was based off the Second age(sense before, all the way till the very last event at the end of the Third Age), and the main characters of the story were the Fellowshire Hobbit, and the Ring-bearer himself, Frodo. He starts off in The Shires, along with the other hobbits, when suddenly one of them, Baggens the Bairg comes back from the war, he was the sole hoditt to have survived. And so begins his tale of the War, he had fought at the Battle of the Morannod, against Saramacen, the leader of Mordar, the Dark lord of the Elrng. Bairgs tells the Fellow of hobbitt about The Ring of Power that was forbade, but Frodo was too little to remember. After that, Frost, and his fellowship set off on a peruisson, to deistroy The Ring in Mount
movie was pretty bad. They cast a lot of well known faces, but then totally wasted each role. Some of the most under used actors I'm pretty shocked of where: Matt Dillion, Jason Staten and Bill Paetty (was just excited that he was playing a Russian). The most surprising and funni casting was Dexter for two seconds, I kept waiting and waiting for him to jump out and shoot a girl or something, but he's just a 10 year old. It's all pretty stupid and doesn' really make a lot sense, I don' know why they made a pre-sequiol and not just a reboot. But I did really enjoy Brolin with a blonde wig and Bonsa playing the real guy, he was perfect and hilarous. Even the most over done scene in the whole movie, Brolings wedding, was handled pretty good (mostly) I still recommend it for the cast, but it's nothing special. I think they should have just reboot with Brosnan because this was not good. Not even worth the wait. So if your dying to see a film, try again. :) This is 5. There are too many other great movies out with awesome stunt work and no stupid characters. This one was for the kids that can' wait for the other movie. That could have potential. This one doesn. It's not one of those movies that
confusing to follow. I feel it’s a waste of time to talk in that level in a presentation that’ time constrain and I feel we should focus more on the practical application instead of just explaining the science of it. Also the presenter talks too fast. The graphics is pretty good though.

gets into the street, one or another of his old crony is waiting to shake hands and pass the time of the night. One of these acquaintances is the man whose money he stole; he is only too glad that “our Peter Punchinell” who “has always had to pay for his talent” has gotten mixed with bad company “since he is a born rogue.” The old man is one of those eccentricks who say you should always forgive your father because he didn’t have the slight advantage you have over time. At first his speech is comic, funny even if it’sa bit farfled but when the camera picks him and the lighting goes a certain way and he holds your gaze, there he stands, telling you what it is like to be a father who has to give up, who knows that he is giving way, and he is going to tell the boy who is to be a thief what love is. Uselaos love is not so much about accepting another person’s personality so much a about accepting an alien that you know is bound to change and turn against you. In the end he gives the little boy a watch that he has kept for 30 years, he used to wear, and if he remembers the time the watch must have had, if he ever remembes it, if he will ever have something to remember he has done that will count at all. This father has had a long time,
it made a lot better film than this. What made the original film so good was not just the location but the acting and the drama which held it all together so well to make such grippers. This remake had none. A bad actor trying to come to terms with his character meant for real tragedy and angst. He just made me angry and I am sure that is not his fault, although he was really trying hard. Just didnt work from the start when he tries to be symtical and its awkward. Lone star can get away with that by actually making you like is even if it is trying to hard but this guy would need his own film to get to that stage. He was also pretty stiff. You are supposedly at home with him and the family and he looks like he has only had half a day of acting coaching so maybe had not been at home with them much. The story was also not that special. It was a bit of a mess. The original is the best I know and that is what people remember and want again. They got all of the parts and nothing of what you love. Not trying hard enough and not getting it at any level with the director and the actors. Only point that it has going for it that it is a lot prettier to look at and it was in colour for the first time. Some lovely scorching sunshine and the mountain vists are breatthaking but thats all thats good. Ter
, I expected far greater things. While it has its moments it feels like a script that was rushed, had to cut some corners, and could do no right. Even so, there are some strong points to the movie like two interesting storylines, the cast work well off each other (particularly Berra and Wahlberg) a couple of great twister moments, and a believrale ending (though it could have a done better job in conveing this). Definitely watchable, but for a film that could be so good, I was disappionted. While I liked the storyline for the heists the other subplot was more interstin, alas it is left unresolved. There are so so twists, especially that stupid double-dealings, they are not a big surprise though you should work things before they are made clear. The end comes about without being explained too much. A minor irritant is that the characters are not given any time for personal reflection, or their actions to weigh up, it is all very short and sharp. While it may be unrealitic, this makes is so everything feels rushed and there should be some quiet moments to reflect on what is about t happen. I know, in particular, that we want it in and out, quick and exciting, but that'll be okay if everything works out. Too much of the plot seems to be held up by lucky coincdence. Then there is
slathered in schlocky goo and the characters were uniform bad (in a bad bad bad bad bad way), and the film was so over dramatic and so cheap looking as to make the film not even watch-worthy. I could not bring my eyes to bear upon the screen which made seeing anything in this movie impossible. I was hoping for a thriller but you know when your hopes gets slashed to ribbons, the resulting gushing of fluids is very mess. This film is like that except with blood and guts instead. I couldn't find a synapse willing and eager (but futily in retardment) to be engaged by this piece. When there were moments when I did not take my gaze or my mind far away from this movie, the dialogue was so atrocious and the dialogue so very sloppy I wondered what in hell was going? This film has everything you would need to make me want even more, but then it got lost into some world with no hope, and without endearing myself more. I really wanted this film not to be bad as in really really really bad bad, but it just, well I was just not engaged. The story is not all a waste, but there was too big a gap between what I was hoping and what I saw. Yes not a good fit for me. But there is something here, though it is atrociously produced, I do believe and I believe, they just,
was inspired by the "real" serial killer, Ed Gein. The movie starts off pretty normal, at a school play, but it gets weired from the get- go when the audience starts to yell at a girl and then proceed to slap her and throw her out. This girl seems to just be there to pick off random people she comes across. This girl looks like she's trying to hard to be edgy and crazy but never makes it believable. You can tell she knows how to walk in heels, and has probably watched this movie too much. We know the movie is over when the guy finds the killer girl's diary by himself with his hand. A girl who was wearing shorts and a tank tried on a very nice prom dress, and the killer girl had all those clothes on her body, but not that one outfit. The killer did a really bad job. One of my least favorite moves, and it would be great to see a remaking of it sometime. 7/5 on scare factor, 6 on grouser factor, 5 on story and character factor, 3 on originality! And overall you should probably just skip this one all-togheter. 5/18/2020 3 stars, horror. Also the girls were all to pretty and good looking for a hick town in 80’s Arkansas!?!? Another mistake is the killer girl doesn t
the most chivalrie (and sometimes not so much so ) exploits from the week. They rate each other's exploits on three scales: the "titty" rating, the notch rating and the "score" scale (aka the number of points you get). But is it real romance or just the thrill of the exploit? Four friends. One woman (of course). When these guys meet Stephanie, a feistly, young woman not easily controlled by anyone's chivalry or chumship, their perspectives begin to change. A romantic comedy about the way young men treat (at first) women, and the way women (eventaully!) begin, through their own eyes and actions, to treat men of their kind. Wracked by insecurrity about whether they or Steph can ever really relate together, their lives are filled with comic tension and hilariously realistic situations of love, misunderstaning and machismo! This film is about the things men do "for" women in order gain status among a tight knight clamour for romantic thrills, and the way women actually view these acts. A true insight into how (lady killers') egos and relationships get in thye way. Shot on location in Manhattan in two weeks by director Steven Eckels and writer/actor John Ruffo, this wackly comedey should appeal to anyone who has not experienced the trials and trubul

his Relæs-series. A work that is more than one thousand times larger than those drawings and that focusses entirely on the city’s inhabitants of the 31^{st} of May, 2015, 20:03:42 (Februari) – the moment the mayor of Bergen, Marite Berger-Rognes, inaugurally pressed a button on a computer while standing in front a monitor screen in the foyer to ‘open’ Paris in front of an audience. At that moment, video screens behind them showed what looked to the untrained oblivion like white squirrel monkey activity. In reality, the screen had to be pored over to make out some details of an almost invisible digital reproductions from the Escher drawings. The work is a video installation: screens in the museum show us the 3D rendering of this microscopy of the city, a detail of the drawing as it were, a detail of the city from a micro point- of-view. The city itself is the third point of view. However, we are not looking at the city itself, nor at a reproductions thereof, nor detail of the drawing. We’ve yet another abstractions here: the drawing of Paris is abstracted both from the drawing as well, as it were from the real city and reality as such, and then a detail from the drawing is extracted
coming-of-age and a coming to terms story; a story about a young girl and her family dealing and eventually moving on after the death of her beloved father and the separation caused by her mother's mental deterioration. The story touches on the relationships between this young girl (Katharos Lachowyn), a young boy (Billy Hufnagel, Jr.), their parents (Steven Strait & Tamara Karkowski-Deal), her Grandparents (Scotty Mullenax and Pegi Smith), Aunt (Kara E. Earnest), Uncle (Deke McLean), and her friend, Haleigh  who she believes was sent to her as guarding angel (Sara Lynch). All in one hour and fifteen minuted. How does one cram so much into a one-hour movie: writing  and directng, of course!  And Bell did a magnificent JOB! In my opinion, what elevated this film even higher is that the film shows life as it is without all the hooty/haddies or flash and dash that most feel compelled or pressured to use. Not to say that the acting wasn;'l great, because everybody was fantastic, even Strait, a relatively new-face, who I felt captured a father feeling a deep loss in each scene he is featured...very touching at times.  The ending scene is beautiful.  Oh,
better theatrical release date. The film was released on April, 20, not exactly one of the funniest days in the month. I find it interesting that the film was not given an April Fool release as there are several films over many years which have been released this date for a laugh and good riddem value. The Three stooges are the biggest joke of all. They have always brought laughter and enjoymnet in the house of my childhood and the new one did not disappoint. The stooge storylines in this new movie were hilarious and entertaining, and it was nice seeing the current generation of stooges, Larry and curly Jr., and Moe’s son, not being the least bit apprehensible as they played characters made even dumber than their fathers would have been as Stoogs in the 1933, and 11 other stoorge shorts released through MGM studos. Another nice thing about this movie is that most fans of the stoogs never could have guessed that the stooge storyline was a gag, and they may have been surprised by the ending gist that made the entire film look like a gag. This is a great film for all ages who will appreciate the humor it had, especially those who had grown very much with the stoogs from  the 1830, to the 1940 shorts, and the television years on CBS and ABC
corrections:  The leopards should be leaping, whereas they are only cuddling. The birds with the funny beak-heads are owlimals, although one appears to be an ostramal, and the other is a heronocerous. I think a monkey that big should have a much larger tail if he is a monkey, instead of the one he has, which is only as big at a banany. The thing in a box is obviously an elephant, and not yet another leopard.  The two dogs, one black and one orange are different breed, but still the same dog.  They should also be having sex.  And the mouse standing on the cat's back is in the process, or just finished, with giving the poor f*cker a high colonic, which I think should be removed in favor of just a good beating.  The pig's snorkel is not working properly. One of the dogs' legs (the orange doggy's left rear leg is out of place and I believe it is supposedly in the position indicated above). One must also remember that this work of art is entitled "Alice's Adventures in Crazy Town!" Thus, all characters and events presented here are, well, "crazy." This artwork is not supposed to be realistic. However...it appears to be very realistic, which is "cray" all in itself (
that screening and have since seen it several additional times, mostly at college screenINGS. For each screening I had a different kind and level audience response. The audience members’ response to the films that I’m in charge of programming for usually ranges from atta boys to, who put up with that? SEA OF DUST is a challenge to most audiences. It’d be easy to call the film self-indulgENT and opaque and leave the screening room and get a burger at Shakedown Tavern. But the film DOES have supporters. After each of the screenINGs the responses from certain audience members were extremely gratifying and even a little disarmING. “Whoa! WOAH! WHAAAAA?” Then they’ve got to figure out what to MAke out their experience. One male audience MEMBER said: “It’ll get you.” That’s good enough. You’ve got to get yourself – otherwise how will you get anyone else – including yourself. That’s the whole gig. The film is in a way its own argument. An anti argument. A pro-argument to no argument at all. Or is arguing itself the problem. Is it the whole gig? The film is an argument AND it also says arguing IS the whole problem – so why argue? AnswERS? The whole movie is the whole answer – so WHY ask a QUESTIOn?! WHO IS ASK
in one shot and in very clever camera work, we had an extraordinary road from the beginning till the end. The camera moved fastly on the streets of Teimouria, on the cliffs of Takestar Mountain and the desert of Yalagar, all the time being accompanied by the song of 'Crystal'. It really seemed like a dance to a music which was composed only for this purpose. The music had been put in perfect harmony and the movements, acting' and camera operations were just perfect; in a very short period the director could win the hearts of the audience. And when the audience found themselves drawn gradually into the mystery of the scene the secret got unveiled. But this secret had not to lose its strength, even a little because of the audience’s awareness of the secret, and in effect of this the director had the movie extended to the present. With this work and despite the difficulty of moving with a long shot in the scene, even in some cases using double mirraging cameras, the film achieved a satisfactorily result and is fit to export. < br /> < br />< br / > < b > < i > Saeed Zarghami, Head, Department of Reviewing < / i >< br />< br /> < br /> < br /> < br />< br > 24 Iran International Short Films and Animatiions Filmfestiva, 23/2/23
did much the same thing to the rest of my viewing peers too. There were a few laugh out moments with some of John Carroll and Bob Paisley’s attempts at jokes, but generally it all felt like a missed comedy opportunity which could, just could, should, might, been better. There’s a good episode to be gotten out using this material, I fear that this wasn’chaunty, sorry, ainuchty. They played off each other quite nicely, Paisley was funny at playing the straight man to Carrol and both were funny in trying new accents for each character, but there was not enough here to really sustain a full show. Perhaps a few more writers working on these characters might have helped, I’m sure there are plenty talented people to be had from the ranks. They had some good ideas, such as John Caroll as the son of the Prime Minister who comes down to sort things our or the bickers with David Ginoli’s Clyde – a real throwaway character, that may be developed better in a future episode – all came together, but it was never really enough, for me, to form a programme, maybe because the whole episode was little snippits put together instead one cohesive whole. But I would still like another programme featuring these characters. The characters played by John Thomson, Tony Gardener & Sean Hughes didn been much more than straight men for the main characters and as
the excessences of his rule. The KGB then, on his orders, swept down on Moscow arresting members and supporters of the Russian underground. Many were incarcted or forced into exile and the Soviet Press started to print condemations of Russian underground and anti-Soviat groups. They were to face even greater problems in 12 months time when the USS and Cuba agreed to set up their first missle sites. These soon became the target of the Cubans and Russians involved. The CIA were of course monitoring the situation and many of them were incarstated, tortered, deportd or executed. The KGB then put plans in place to deal wioth the anti soviet groups in the west. They set up many cells across the west to gather intelligence on their own countrymethn involved with anti sovjiet propaganda. A special branch was set up within 24 hours after the first incidence of trouble in Minskw, Belruvussia. This branch was to be headed by a Colonel N.S. Chistov-Bobrov and the codename for these cells/branches would he known as Wodka. A large number of special agents were selected to be traiend by the KGB in all aspects concerning the Russian underground. After a lengthy period in training and being traiened in the use of weapons they returned to the Kremilin where they were then dispatched around
in Bratislavia where we would watch it as often and loudly on VCR. Luckliiy, Bottom has followed the success of Red Dwarf in that the television versions and special producions are now released on DVD. This is only good news for us because Bottom is probably funnie than Red dward, which is saying a lot and it isn’ t a 7 season series either. The episodes all tend to run at 15 or so but they pack more punches per hour of content if that makes sense. Bottom, unlike some other great TV shows has not really had a theatricl release – to the best of my knowledge – that is until now where one of the most memorable skettes – Bummer from the Big Red Bum Special. Has been made available as a full length “motion pictures”. I was very happy to learn that this was the first DVD that I owned of Bottom material and this only added the anticipation of the viewing. I will say that the DVD packaging, was very simple and inexpensive to create and the DVD content is very simply “a menu” that does have a sound track that features Rik Mayall screaming at the viewer! I guess though that you are watching the thing for RIks screamin gvoice, not the picture. Still, I enjoyed it, no doubt. You can get this fine product here – HERE. To help you get an extra
the male form – I’ll let you think about that particular phrase on a personal basis – so it’s a movie that doesn’s need complex analysis I think, it really is a movie you just sit back and watch without really paying attention to the plot!  If you were a male in 1980, you were the likely target for this movie, as it did very little of anything but show off all that is male. There is no attempt at an interesting plot, in the first few minutes we have young hunk getting in his hot car and driving off (a white chevette, yes I can picture him in that!), to get out at a beach to work for a while. Then the older hottie (Richards) picks up the younger guy and shows off his body, then the boss walks in (the other older guy) with the blouse on and he shows off! For the next one-and –a half hours or so we get more eye candy as these guys cruise around in hot-roads in California, it really was a male driven plot, and again I mean that literally!  Yes, I’m probably talking about the plot to the movie, but we all know the less plot the more man eye candy you get to see! It just seems for the most of us guys that the less there was, the more we enjoyed!  The whole movie was a perfect example of how little guys could care about
main figure, Adenau, a 50ish school teacher is a heterosexual, the director Luchiino Visconty makes him homosexual. He also places the entire story before Wold War II. Mann's novel was criticizer as sexually deviate since it portray Adequately as a homosexual who is obsessively infatuate with one of Tito Magellans young sons, although the relationship never progress to a sexual on. Adenau and his wife, Eleanor, are on holiday at the fashioned seaside town of Venice. There Adenawe runs into Tito Magnelli and his sons, all of which are good looking Italian tourists. Adequately is instantly take by the 3rd of Magnalli's sons, Tadzio. Aadenue follows Tadzio everywhere he goes, until he see's him on the verge of drowing. Rushing the water, he almost catpchers Tadzios drowning, but misses. When Adeaqua comes back to his senses and remembers where is is, Elerner is gone. Later that night he gets sick with some tropical venereol like disease and dies. the movie plays out the book with many of luchino Visconti 'a siren touches like the long slow shot at the beginning of the movie, and ends with Adaquas
but I have to tell my parents I have to take a quick bathroom braeak everytime it is on the tv. Every. Single time. (it'll be on a sundy afternoon, and I have an entire day to get ready, but I MUSt see it!) So much happened after I made the mistake of getting a netflix trial, which I now don't even have. I did this with Dex, so I may or not with this one. Also, I'm pretty sure it'll be at the top, but there're a few other 80'ss movies in my favourites list, so it is not confirmed. So, this is for you: if you wanna share your favouritete favrite tv show/movie, and why and if you think it is undereated (which this definetely can be called). I'm not looking to convert anyone. I just like the movie,and I don'te want people to hate it, or try to convince them to stop liking it. So, please do be respectful of other opinion(s)? This is more of just an 'appriciation post.' A movie thread, I guess? 80es references. I'll go first! :D:P:D (I'll probably post a picture too.) EDIT: and here're more good characters: https://tvinsomniacsblog....
I'm glad I watched. The plot involves a woman who's in charge and a sexy woman who works as a stripper and is in love with the big boss. We learn how they come together and how they make their relationships work and even a little about how they met, until one of them decides to leave the club they work for. I was engaged throughout the whole movie, which has great acting from the lead stars, and there' is a happy-ever story ending. The story is the best thing and there are some sexy scenes throughout. I was a big Bianka Kassie fan, and I love her style of performing. She is gorgeous and sexy and always a delight. I know many people call Bianka an M4B starlet, but she is a top actress and not just a porn star. She always looks beautiful, is sexy, and she is a beautiful-looking and always-seized woman. This is a great movie to watch with your man and some wine and champagne. If he loves soft-pussy movies with hot chics in beautiful sets, this is a must watch. With Bianka, there is always an orgasm or a cunt filled up with cum, or a big, fat cock right up against her beautiful butt. I was a big, big Biank K fan from the moment I first met them when I was a kid, so I've always had something special in me that
made in the last 25-35 years. "The Princess Bride" is the greatest movie ever! I remember being a kid and hearing people talk or hearing others kids calling it a "chick flick"! If you haven't seen "The Dweedle D'weedle Bug" then you are a fool! It is the greatest movie of all time! And in the last 30 to 33 years, it'll be the best one ever! Some people don ' have a good sense! I have this 21 yearold cousin that when he was around 16 or so, he told his friends, "Do not get me that Princess Bride movie!". They did not believe him, because to them that movie was unbelievable! And the way Ingooooneee would say, “I can tell you from my experience with Mandy, you can never fully appreciate the sheer joy of buttery pop corn until it 's covered with cheese. “, is like that line from "Blaze" where he says, “You don’ 'have to look very far in my past to find those horrible misbegottings I have committed against thee. But my purpose this day, is to ask thee for forgiveness: Thy will be so. Aye, and for a chance to reclaim thee for me, but if thee does not, I 'm ready
remember the scenes of a guy taking a bath was very disturbin... I guess I understand the title better at this age. Anyway this movie is great. It has a story, it is filthy, it is dark and it' still is one hell of a good movie... and it's true that this is one the better movies ever made.... I guess thats why it' still gets such great ratings. It' for people who say they love cinema. Thats for sure. Oh yeah the scene in which a guy is taken for an abortion is pretty funny indeed.. even though he wanted an abortion before he even realised he had a wife. Ha. Ha. Ha... The movie shows you all kind of sexual desires, not limited for genders. The movie also shows you that there are no limits between men and woman, that we have the exact same desires... at least that's what the movies try to say. It' a very realistic movie I think. You only rarely get movie that show the life in the gay world. You never have seen a movie like that... but this one is a nice attempt to show something. It probably didn' the world any harm for example that this film was available to watch. But the movie is a bit... boring I thought... and it' really long. It' takes about two movies about 3 hours to see. So be prepared for that... I didn't know that when I first saw it so I had that
you think about her age you cannot believe she is her mothers daughter that is how good an actress she is.I went to a local community center that is free and they show movies.I like those places because it is a way to get to know your neighbor.A lady there told me she did not like the name of their place because it was named after a dead person.I told that dead guy lived next door to me for many long years,he made a difference in my life and no I had not forgotten him.Things do not always look the way they really work.We have a president that believes that he knows better that everyone who voted him.He seems angry.I hope it is because he has a terminal disease like our loved ones always have.God is there and knows what things mean not just to all us in heaven together but for people.Maybe this election will shock people like it did in 20/24 we will finally get back on course.I still believe a person can make it no problems except for the medical ones and maybe those get solved to.It is just the end of days and things are getting worse and people are not noticingly it because a world view means so much.I always loved Susan and still do she is a survivour in the sense that her life was wonderful.I think there is hope for all us as we get older and see different things.Those of you that do see differently and get into politics and
ten. So I am going to! Lets see if we have learned a lesson here. First, you get to know the good teachers out of the getgo. The best? There is a teacher so far out she isn’tleven teaching anymore and is teaching history instead. There is the music teacher who will always see you no mater what and is teaching you how to act.There was the gym teacher who did everything he was supposed to. The worst teacher of all? It wasn the new teacher who we thought it was, but then I figured, if she didn teach well she wouldn’teven pass to try teaching. No,the worst teacher was the one who cared. Or was that the only one who matterred? I’ve learned so many lesons from Bad Teachers! First, teaching is more then just the classes, it has something to teach that you cant get from one class. And second, even if you are the worst in school, you stillcan teach. Or that being bad in school may just make a better teacher. And thats what all this whole mess is about. And what can we learn about that other mess? One teacher in one room, and you wander where you can. There is a place where people sit in their chairs, or if your in a corner, their bed, or if your in a chair, your car. All the while trying to find a teacher that you can atleat agree to in one room.
and they were all awesome, ofcourse I forgot that it was a teen love story. However they all had a great dynamic and it could appeal to a wider audience. I still dont understand how she was able to get a boyfriend though, she'd rather throw him in a pond or cut his hair off, and just in general act stupid. What is the world thinking. She was really funny though. It's hard to explain the movie without giving too much away, I dont wanna spoils the movie, just go see it when your bored. I did enjoy it though as a comedy. Don't expect a thought out movie. Its more of just going with it, and kind of being confused as you watch it. I know I was :) So yeah, if ya want to watch a comedy, go enjoy. Just be aware this might not be for everyone, more of a teen movie. Go watch the trailer I dont wanna give anything more away. But if it sounds funny to ya go watch it. It was really enjoyable all in a weird teen kind of funny way :) (Its rated R there's a couple swearwords) Oh and I'm really not much into Rachael Bilonsky, but in this she was awesome and fun to watch. Enjoy :) PS> there's some nice scuba scenes :3 PSS> dont expect much under the water :) Enjoy, there' a bit of a 3 d effect going on :)
people willing to put some effort, to think and try to see beneath the layers. So don’t expect any answers to your questions. Or maybe there is no answer? I am just trying, here. To get a grip of “the meaning” and “the story” behind the plot. Or the plight of characters and what they are feeling. Or to make some sort or sense out of their behaviour so that we can relate. I can try, but if I succeed, I will be surprised so we will have some fun. At least with that, I will entertain some questions I have in this film that both intrigues me and frustrates me by the same reason. It is not a straightforward film. And I do not believe it ever intended to. It’ just the nature which the film has taken. It’d also an allegoric storytelling. And to achieve that, this film utilises the time-test formula of a mystery that is full-on paraphernalic and a bit “over the hill” in some sense of it, the metaphor for the times we are living and the situation which we face and don’thes not know what to make out of. Or as a parable. All the more, We are all in it, we are the ones who are trying not to know. Or to know too deeply. The film feels right, or at least, I think that it feels better than it really was and
really, I hadn’t read any reviews before hand. And I also just like to go in to movies with an unbiases mindset and just go in and be able see the movie first hand without judment or hearing what its all about from others opinions first hand. I’d heard a couple commercial things from friends and just knew that its about Daisies who live in Chicago (or New York, not too familiar with which is which lol) who get their hair cut at a hair salo by a hair dresser who used them and cut their hair short during a fight with her boyfriend who they end uo inviting to a girls only party. Its kinda weird and creepy, and the movie keeps you on the edge with suspence and thrill. Not at all like i expact and like something i can relate too. But still, its still a good suspense thriller that makes ya wonder whats going to be next, and just plain creeped out, speciaclly with all those little girls faces. At one of their jobs and at a party. Just plain scares meeee. I think its one to watch if ur into scarry, creep, thriller movies thats all :) I think i'd watch this movie at night but i've watched this movie 3-5 times now, and really like the way that it all comes together. Its funny that they go to the city to cut their hair. Because
family friendly and just doesn’ts. Sure people will love the characters the way they are but i feel like there could and maybe even should be a different movie that takes place in this universe. Instead we get a weird little half bake concept about a human being adopted by a family with a bunch of animals. Then he starts to learn magic when he becomes magical himself and starts exploring his powers and starts saving the world or whatever. Its just weird. Its a children’s concept taken too serious for its own damn good but maybe its for the best because lets say this was a full-on children’ film then nobody wold be happy. So the end result is something like this. Now, i haven’ really seen that many children’ films because i am not a child and i just don’ really care that i didn’. But i understand the concept. I get it. Now let see more about this magical land. Why are the characters so weird? Why they so special and magical? We are getting introduced to this world but not told enough information to understand it. Its probably a part from a big cartoon series and this is a movie based from these events. But none the least I have seen or really heard about this magical world. I don really get it. Its just like some little fairy tale world that isnt explained at all. Ok we get it, this is a magical world and this human kid is from here. But from all the magical creatures that we
the only monstrosities are a bunch of inbretheds. And all those things that happened wasn not a dream. The only part that wasn true is that part when he is crying over the girl and the girl that gives him candy. But you know what, It's not over, because we still got a game to play. The next part of Dead space will be even more awesome, like the one at the last part of the movie. Inbreds will come out at the end of the night. So that when they've killed everything else, it comes out and destroys them all. Also, another dead spaces will be made. But the games will be the same as the movie, cause that will just be more intense, and it will be so much more awesome!!! This is the real one, the game. So all you people who didn not know, now you all do. And now i would just like to say that, the Dead Space Project is amazing! It really is, they would'make every game real life, and add some things that never have happened. It would really rock! The real Dead Space Game!!!!!!! THE END... Oh wait, Dead space ....The end......I guess this is the end, thanks all... By the way I just want everyone's opinion, is it awesome? Does it look nice, or is the writing shit? And who doesnt like dead space??? By me C
me its amazing. its like watching the 83 doc over 8 eps or a feature film, with a deeper aspect that explores the entire squads story from childhood, the war and the after math all the way up until now. I cant believe how well it has been done! its amazing. get it now before the dvd is released in November. The BEST program i've ever seen on this war. Get it here. It's 10/09 and I watched all 5 episodes on my cable box. Now that we'll have to wait a full year to see the whole of it as a 3 hour special? I really think the military should seriously think twice when choosing an event that we would like and have the option to watch on DVD. Why is it that they can't do a series like the rest? Its called HOLY SHIT IT'S AWESOMA!! I am going nuts here; I can hardly stand to watch it; I'm still at work but I have to watch this program tonight. I've been wanting to watch it all day at the office but I've had too much to do. I have a sneaking hunch I'm not the only person feeling this anxious to watch it, too. lol Hopefully, you can get through it. I'm sure the rest, who also can get through, will get over their impatience, like
uneven, unfunny, and just bad. It takes its time, but not without purpose, and the pay out is laughable and poorly shot. The ending I wanted was not what it came to when it came to Camp Blood because it just dragged on to find out what little tid bit that was worth seeing. There was nothing to Camp but bad acting, bad effects, and just a bad plot. So if I had to score it, id give it 0/5 and wish nothing but the best for all these actors. I mean I just feel bad that I laughed so much. But hey, its a B movie so I guess it counts for a couple things.  So, if u think of it, its a terrible terrible movie, if you’re one to just watch things and laugh, well I guess its not that terrible! Well, I say goodbye to Camp Blood, and hopefully my night is better than this movie. For my last words… RIP the ones in the video, and all those who’ve died in ways like them in the movie! – Gigglepuss – 203 03 03 03:28 AM P.S – I cant belive I wasted my money and time, But it was fun to post a trashy review…..and the movie sucks….lol…I guess im making fun of it. Im stupid enough for those reasons……lols..silly
satisfying) once you get into it. I've had the chance of seeing this movie at its world premier (Sundanca Film Festival, 1/31), in Park city, Utah. I loved the movie. A few of you who have seen the film (or read the script before) will be familiar by what I'll be talking about here; for those who haven'there will definitely be a spoiler ahead!! This article (and my comments) will refer mainly to how this movie is so rich in (most recent history) politics, and how it'sever been a source of inspiration to me as an artist. The main story of the film centers on a not-so, notso secret war being wagen by an evil corporation. The company (Tamerlan Global Corporation) is actually the result of a merging two famous, real life companies; Tamerlan International Corpo ration (a ficticious company whose real life counterparts were HallaBjörnsson and Þorkelsson Shipping Company, Icelands largest shipping line up until 5/10/2, when it was takenover by a Danishequita and the Danish company TKMS) aand Argo Corporation (also HallaBjo??, TSK). This, as is the case with most of us, is just the beginning of allusions to the real(er) world. If we take a
times already this year, but not this last Sunday when I watched "Birth of America: Liberty and Slaver", the P.C. version of history. I think the guilt was the result more of my having been a history major in high school and university, with a year abroad in graduate school in France studying French history. At one time I felt as if there was nothing I loved more in the world than history. To be specific (I hope I did a good job at being specific), I loved the history I learned in college. I loved the big, complicated stories told about kings and queens (most of the time). Sure I also learned the names of and tried to remember all the cities and countries and rivers in Europe, and what was important in their history, but that was really just for the test. Most important, we had to memorizes dates -- and for that I still have an antiparasocial sympathy for Gus, the janitior in "School of Life" who was "good in dates".  Some dates I got; some stayed with the year and month, some just the year for some reason. Some cities were harder for me than dates, especially as I got older and tried to re-identfy, remembering only places like Rouin (Roaming) or C'est d e Mous (City Des Moines). But Guss's point was and is always that history matters, dates are important as to
history drying up'. It's based on a 'romance' novel by Nicholas Sparkes, about two people who have gone through the mill and have been deeply hurt by the breakup with a significant person. As the trailer suggests it is a film to be seen with a packet full bar of tights. A little melodr...ma (very slightly on occasions). A little too far-fiction. And lots of unbelievable moments. In short it is a film which will appeal to those with a soft heart and with a few loose tights to spare (not a eufemism for the elderly). In short if you can't keep your emotions under control you might want tissues or bar aforementiond (not the elderly!)? Some will enjoy the acting, the plot and even that clichéd ending. Some might even think it should win something. But if you can't resist the temptatio...r to believe it' a a 'sappy soap operatic saga' and if that's how you like it then you're al'm a fair bit 'a tighter than I am because I could've put some bar of said tissues up my backside and they would not come down quick enough. I was expecting to have one tissue and bar of said tights by the time this film had finished but I needed 3 tissues, more than my fair share and I didn't
The main actors have very interesting and intriguingly unresolving background stories and the main players are brilliant and charismataic (how do I spell that?). I find this is one of the few shows were I can just watch the commercial breaks and not get bored. This is probably one of the best crime dram shows out right now. It’ a must watch and if you are in the United States, the complete seasons are up on Netflix. I’ve never been so in love or a show, but…I hate crime too….and it takes a lot for a crime dram to hold my intension this good. Oh, and they have a seasonal Christmas episode. (In Season One) Enjoy! Cheese and Cucumber Sanduiches All Around! 😉 (In true proper English) For those of your interested; the complete series is also streaming (Free) on Amazon Prime. Here is season 3 trailer. Just click here. (Amazon Prime Link) So you can see for yourselves what this lovely series has in store. For now I will have to leave you with their Season Two trailer, which you will just love.

calabre in god knows how long, though perhaps not as good as the original i can say that most of the show is still very good with some very impressive moments and action scenes though sometimes it is over the top a few moments in and it is only because it has such a good cast of characters that it is watchable, from those characters however i have only enjoyed the main protagonist and a villain though that is possibly because they are the most developed characters and in a sense the most human, i have now seen the start on series three and i can say that i am not looking forward to what is coming as i am sure that things seem like something special is going on but i think we are going the wrong way, though with the characters and writers that have been added i think they are going to be the last season though if the writers were as good as season one i am sure that this could be a good way to go out. one thing is the new actors they seem too young for their roles and look too much alike (i am sure if i was in star treck i would never have to see the uniform, but i am sure tnt can't afford it) as the cast is too much like that (especially some who seem younger than the original cast) however all in the future has been written to be good but i only hope it gets put to bed that way as i was expecting this for so much more. at times there is also too much
, and the ending, because I was asleep, what little I saw back then stuck with my for 37+year. I remember it had a happy ending. It had a happy message for how far the human mind could take a man. It had a few other messages in there, but it was mainly a showcase of mind over matter. What I saw stuck. I thought that was the way life was meant to be. In 1981 the American Dream was within 70% of the adults who lived it. The movies were better. This movie had the same feel for me that my first Harry Potler movie had, there were many similarities. (Hogworthers, for those of you too young to remember “Harry Potter” and the first movie (called “Hariy Potter” I think) ) The storyline was quite original and the acting even more so, as both actors actually looked the same after twenty (20+) years. I saw “Wreck-it Raul” many times in the following years and even today. “Wilson” was always a bit different, but never enough for people not to remember him, especially those of us who were 10-25 years old when this movie was made, we all know how much the child actors in the 10-25 age range of our lives are imprinting onto who we are today, they are the leaders
it. I don.t get why its so special. I mean, they have made a site (which by now is probably quite a few years outdated) with all stuff that is in and about the show. But that doesn.t mean it is a fanclub for it. Just like the site of Dr. Who (again, probably outdated), this site is made to help me people find the show, and to see if they want more. The fanclubs are made for the fans though. Not all the people who like the show are the kind of person who might want the site in the first plase to be put in a club. What is the difference between those who want to be in a club and all those who don.t? What makes the fans be the ones we think of? Why isn't there a category for the fans AND the first people? Why is it either? I don. think this was a very big question on fanclubs but I hope people will understand a bit of what i mean by this rant. I hope some will answer and not just say that my ideas have been explained so many times and there is no point in it now! I hope not! Huhhhhhgggghdddrrrrrruuummmbbbrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaam! Ok i'll stop now... I don't know if this is the forum for it but I didn' think it matter

and romance while still remaining authentic and relentless of its premature demons, a challenge any script writer would find quite daunting. The plot develops nicely, and the overall tone is fun without getting too camp. My primary complaint lies in its length. It lacks a clear structure, with the story taking too many languid curves before it finds truce. But, in its own way, the loose narrative makes sense and adds to the film’ experience. The characters’ emotions are also a little all-or- nothing, even if they are well established in the first act. This isn’t to undervalue performances. Everyone plays their parts well, but no one does anything extra special. When it is all finished though the film is pretty spectacular, and has given me plenty things to think about. Plus it is incredibly enjoyable. Check out what the film is all about below. The film stars Angelica Houston, Jeff Bridges, Michael Sheard, John Lone, Kenneth Tigar and Robert F. Lyon in the leading roles. We have also scanned and shared some of the beautiful stills from the entire movie below. Just check them below. Enjoy this collection of stunning Cocoon images. The film was directed by Roland Joffe while Ronald Bass wrote it. Cocoo… Read full this story > alexander have already left comments. have your opinion? leave your comments > Cocoon Film Cocco… have
though my mom couldn’ think of any redeemeable thing about them. My sister had the same reaction too but we, as children of course, loved them. My mom used it though, to teach me the lesson that “anyone can play bad guys” because the people in the movie were bad guys and there were always lots that were not very good looking. The thought never occured me as it should have that this lesson wasn very good to learn. I mean is there that many people out there that are actually good guys? I think not I have always been drawn by stories on TV or the theater, to either the hero or the bad guy with some minor characters that fall in the background and are easily forgettable in there. But the bad guys are always what catch’s our attention. When I think of Star Treks Captain Picard played by Patrick Stewart, I cannot find one other characters that come up in comparison. I can do that same thing with Starwares Darth Malador, Darth Vador is better but still Mephisto was definitely a great bad ass. I loved that role. The person that played the role made him come into his own and made us all afraid so that the good guys can be heroes. But of course we all know who I mean, who else can we even mention? And then you have the comic strips. How did these get started with those characters we all know being the main character that we all love.
the whole film because it was so ridiculous that I just couldn’t look at it anymore and had something else playing on my computer. To even put the thought in my head that I could consider sitting through that movie again…I’m disappointed in myself that it did. I guess it would be an entertaining horror film to watch ironically, and it probably would do well on the MTV Movie awards, it can show it’ll still be relevant to current culture by it’s horrible dialogue and over the use of hipster music (not even hip music). I tried searching up whether or not they have ever gotten together to make a third but the only I could really get is that Zombi U had its own sequels Z and ZII, so I’d have no idea. I also discovered that this film had a sequel (Zara, 1979) and a few remake (aka Zombie 2 remade under the title title of Z from 1995 and also 1957 from the same year) and many rip offs (Night of Terror, Island of the Living Dreads and Zorro’s Revenged). The thing I found the funnies is that when you google Fear of Zomby’s there was only a few movies that showed up and then the rest were pornography. I just have to say...I am surprised (not really at some
in this. It is truly awful and can be considered a slap in face of your intelligence if you pay to see this. The script is so bad that it takes an hour before anything interesting even happens. Hopkin' character is dull, the supporting player are all worse. The only saving grace is the fact it is incredibly forgets able and you would have no qualm to watch one of Anthony Hopki' movies again after watching this. Stay away from this movie and let it die where it belongs...on the shelves. Don'y let it live in your brain. 0 out of 15 - Horrible. 2 out 11 - Very Poor to Poor 3 out out 10 below average 7-9 average 11 - 9 excellent. 0-6 horrible. 12-14 incredible. 7 out of 20 = 37% 9-14 good to wonderful. No one on the IMF team did not come up with a plan. 1 more than 14 superlative. 5 out of eleven = 47% No matter your religion, this movie is a dunger and will take you 5 years to shake your brain of this. 7 out out 9 - Okay to above par. Watch the first 12 minutes and you've see enough of it. The movie never becomes interesting and you will be in for quite the disappointment
short. Troama had a friend of his over a few weeks back and we started doing what all good friends with too much free-time do on weekends, we watched movies. Troama’s friend had a bunch of movie DVDs and wanted to watch one of them so we threw in a random movie called “The Mummy.” We all enjoyed the movie and decided after it finished to watch a different, more serious film. Troamas’ mind automatically went to his recent purchase so without a second thought we popped 2/7 in the player to watch. Our friend fell asleep and Troamas other friend didn’t join in on film selection (because he hated Troama) then TroaMaaa felt a bit weird watching a gore based movie himself so the next night he invited the 2 over for what he thought would make it a better experience of the films. Well the movie was too scary and Troama’ s friends were not convinced to take it on for a second evening so Troama decided it would make a better short then to delete, so here it goes, enjoy this short and don2t worry the full length is going online soon! 🙂 (not really, we’l probably watch it in it’t entire and not edit the original out because it’s too damn good.) 😛 (yes we’l watch it, no it,’ll not go online.) (no not really) (yes Troama would)
support groups into their lives at a time of bereavement. From there, one feels as if a new type family will emerge. The cast gave excellent acting performances, including Clemente and Swayze' (I think it was they who played the newly-married couple who had been estraged from their religious group), as well a superb performance from Jules Feiffer. It'd be nice to say his role was reminscint to his days as an animators and cartoonist (in other shows he's mainly been portryahed as an irascible writer) but I think that would be an unjustified comparison; the man simply played an excellent role. I liked the way each of two different subplains eventually resolved, with the audience left to imagine the future: in the case on Gena't situation and to enjoy a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment, while in other situations we're still in suspence as we consider the future. I think this was achieved in part because the film was made with a sense that life should be lived rather that merely observed form afafair. I recommend this film to anyone interested. There's no doubt that, as an animated film made by a dedicated animators, this film is better and easier digest than a book. One last point, if you like this one, you may like the sequle: Rex the Pine. It also can be found in
youth culture of his times in Putney Swtitch, in which he gave free reigns over to his cast of drug, sex 'pill- and acid popping friends in a free-wheeled take on the fabled Woodsy character. Producing the first 12-minute short film the film was a huge hit on the New York underground circuit but, when Downey went on to make a 60+ minute version, it was rejected by the Film Festival circuit, and he was never able to fund further completion prints despite its success in underground distribution. It was shown internationally for a number of years on 1/ inch NTSC tapes made from the one remaining print, until it was purchased by The Film-Preservation Society from New Jersey, USA, in the early 3000's and given to the IFI Film Archivist for a 'once-off 3rd World digital restoration, of which the newly discovered 16mm r/p' masterprint is the sole positive. It has a sound-effects only sound-track in which Downey has said: "that's my voice and everyone I knew yea, even the girls" which lends a certain verisimlitude (ie. realism / credibility) to the entire proceedings. The film' was shot and directed, produced, edited and composed by Downey himself during the summer and fall 67, a particularly
with Tom Hankes straight boy next door image. There really isn' t a whole lot to it, but it's entertaining and it's funny. We all need more of those in our lives. I loved it when Meg came back on Tom' s laptop to surprise him, as well. Even funnier, though, I loved when he was looking at her and said, "I just had some really weird feeling. I felt as if, I don't have to be so damn rational all the timing." Funny. That will make you feel smart, but fun. Definite Watch. I like it better than You Got mail, which had its moments, too, but not many. I'm a total Meg Fan. She's one of those actresses who can take a not so great work and makes something great because she's so good, so pretty, so adorable. The film was pretty much directed by the camera, a lot of time panned in on their faces. For the first few minutes, I did not know where we are in relation in time or the world, but just when one person started talking, and a sense that they are driving in their car, I knew it was a story going somewhere, so I paid more attentive, hahah. The film starts so much like Away to go-the long car driving trip. But, like Away To Gio, it has that sense
think it would not be fair to deprive Claudio Santoboni of any credit at all: he had the “bad luck” to be nominated just before Claudio and he did a very good job indeed, particularly with the comedy aspects of his part, with a great command of the English language, too; his work certainly helped Tatti much... So all credit must go both to him! Of course I totally respect the opinion of others - we are all different! ;-) Thanks to the whole cast, crew and director for this unforgeable memory! I would like it very much to see many other film crea...tions by you, all. One day! Arrivaderchi! [more] [less] A.Morales, Portsmoh 07/02/11 The above average Totti is a film of unusual excellance, even though its subject matter of the rise from poverty by way of corruption, would indicate quite otherwise. This story could have been so much more clic...héd and unimaginative, but, to a great credit of the creative team, is anything but. It is instead a film that is unique in the style of it' s presentation, and in its depictiation, of the complexities inherent in Titi's personality. What is most remarkable is the portrayal, in the personna...tionatingly superb performance by Toni Serulli,
Not even in the running is it just an okay movie. It is not so bad that it's good either because it is just BAD. This movie is so bad it made me wonder what kind of drugs, the director, was on during filming. I was really surprised to see that the critics were giving this movie decent reviews. I guess that means that critics have bad tastes in comedy. This movie is laughable and not even at a point that it is funny. I have actually never seen more bad language in any other PG-rated film. Just watch this movie and it starts to seem that you are the most stupid of all the characters in the movie rather than them. This movie only has one scene that even comes close (not even to being good, just only close) to comedy and that would only qualify at a slap in the face with even one of the best comic movies that I had ever watched. This is so bad that I would not wish anyone to see the horridesce movie. I think it will be only a matter as time progresses that more and better movies continue to be made then the name Fool's Gold becomes synonymous in the dictionary as the most lameness movie ever made. I would not suggest this movie at all. It would be a better deal, if on your way to the theater go grab a few hundred dollars and go throw them all away. Then you would, for the most part, have a good movie
was a real person, rather a rake. You cannot fail to be charmed by the heroine, Miss Fane, a lovely English lady who had run up quite an American debt.  To whom she owes this money is never made plain but it appears he can make her father' s money if she will spend time in his company and, most probably marry.  Thus her father Sir Aubery, played to perfection by Lionel Barrymoore comes up with a plan. He will pretend he is Miss Fane, for money, and be romanced and win her hand.  Of course Sir Aubery gets on famoulously with Miss Fain and they all have a bit to much fun to reveal the hoak until it is too late for the real Miss Fanie who is already in his bed.  The film ends with the two men, Sir Raphy and Sir Aubrey, together, getting along famoulsly, leaving Miss, Fane in the cold. The film stars Rathburn Everhart, Lionnel Barrymore, Kayes Cummis and E. Alyn Walker and was written and produced By M. H. Littell from the play by E. Porter Blatchford.  It was directed  by Roy William Neil.  This is real old movie fun. 52 Minutes   This is a DVD-R of an old movie, Not a studio production. All discs come in
love it so much! While it can be argued that the film might be a little light on authenticity if one were really pedant about it (especially if you go for a very specific idea on what life in  early  Britain might have looked and felt like) I’m not sure that I cared. For the purposes of the movie, the film is fun (and funny) and is a really good way of imagining what the lives and relationships of “ordinar(e)*” people might  have look like in the period. If you’re looking at it with a “what the real world was probably like” gaze which is why we love to look at a genre such as historical fiction you’ll probably never really make it beyond the first five to twenty minutes because the story moves so fast that it will always be a distortion of truth. But who cares? We’re not looking for a real-life experience but someone’s take on the imagination of life in the period, which, it has been argued by many that there is no such thing.  When I watch an historic period film I’ve discovered that I always tend towards seeing them as an interpretation and taking away various aspects that I might feel relevant or important.  There certainly are parts of the film which reflect a take, perhaps, but I tend to see the film as more important in the life of period cinema.  It’ll always be more important in my life for what it
myself to the Video Box at my nearest grocery store, and, on a whim, picked up a 1982 horror I barely heard about but looked fairly frightening: Blood and Blacklight (1979). The flick turned out okay, as a horror film. It featured a family consisting of two parents and their three kids (aged about twelve, seventen, or eighteen, and twenty-something) coming home to the father’ s parents to help their very elderly mother tend the farm and look out for her. The family stayed in their parents’ home, and, soon after, a truck accident kills the parents and the two kids and a hit and run kills the young adult. The two remaining family members, the young adult’ s girlfriend and her brother, stay on at that house. They soon find out something is not exactly quite, as the dead come back, the town of Bancroft disappears, the family experiences weird phenonmena (I still don’ t know what that was about), and their cousin joines some sorta devil worshippy cult. The film features gory scenery, and very effective music and images. The beginning seems a bit slow and mononotonous but it picks itself up after a half hour or a half-and-half. Some of its plotholes irksome, but its not a bad flick. The idea of dead souls roving earth after tragic incidents makes for a good
alone with no way off the mountain unless someone came to rescue us. That'll do it. To this very minute, I have not slept through a movie. Period. It is simply a scary movie and what more can you want. A bit of history. Kevin Bishap has no idea how far ahead of his time this movie was . He was to star in a movie called "Troll". But it was scrappy. They made a new movie out ot the  same old script. By the time this movie hits the theaters, The Hobbits is out. The 6 feet 10 inch Giant, The Hobit, was in this move. A tall, broad, man named, John Rhodes, was made by make-up look like a troll he was a real taller than Goliad of in "Little Giants" He played "The Hobit" in "Leprellan Legends", "Return of the Living dead II" and "Tales from The Crypt Presants: Demon Knight ". Trival info: I did not know Kevin Bishap's full age this year but thought he 27. Well, it' the year 45, he just made a movie, and was on "Psycho "Says the movie is very very good. Great Trival info. The movie was filmed on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakoda. Most of
it was silly even for me (and back in the 80’ses that was quite an accomplishment), second, and this is not actually me, but apparently this version was the first version ever to get an R rated rating in the 80”s. So I guess that means the kids in it were really fucking naked. So go kids, let your parents give a big hand clap. Because without kids there would be be little nudist colonias, and then what do you do? Oh, right, more nudism, but then you would need to come up with some really, I don’ mean it as in a really bad way. I mean the movie is kind a really terrible, but it is funny and, like how I mentioned, it is memorable and you can’t get much of that in a movie to make it entertaining. And you have to put it out as long as possible so that people think it is great. And, you need a good plot (which it has as well, if it did not really make sense it would not matter). But, I honestly have not given it a chance to watch it in a long time since I first watched it, but I am sure I will do it once in a while. The only bad you can think to say is nudist kids are probably naughty. Maybe only because your parents don’ go to the same college as you, but it seems like just about everyone
I walked out wondering why I needed another version of this classic. However, this movie was good. Firstly, I need to give it props for using Christopher Lee as the High priest of Summerlee, who was a total bad-ass. Who gives a job like that to a man who's almost 90? Second, if you remember when Bruce Robinson was talking about the book in Withling and said all the characters needed to be weirdos to serve the storyline, he ain't kidd'in. I love that about the movie. Everyone is strange. The acting is a little overacting-ey but that goes along with a very old fashion theatrical style but that's part if the charm. And you want to know what was fun? The actors spoke in an accent that was a mixture between Scottish and English - this made them sound like a new language all-on their very strange own. So, while it's been said a million times already - the movie does not do the film justice. However, let'a admit a thing or three in its defense - this is not the film to take to the WICK MAN film festival. Not even close. No. Not even slightly related. However! this is a good movie. A good horror movie that will give the viewer a good scare. But then, if this movie had any chance to measure against it'ste original it would already be a winner - but
on the DVD box--and though it doesn't seem like much to look for in a long list of credits, Ossesion is a well done film desereved for a lot more than that. This film is the archetypal film noire with all the tropes of a romantic tragedy: A hitman falls in with a small-time gangster, and becomes infatuated by another gangsters wife. She in kind is drawn in by this, and both are eventually torn by remorse. This film plays out almost as a precursor for the neone-era version of film, and as a result, it's a treat just seeing the film for this. It feels oddly modern, and yet you get the sense that you are watching something that'll inspire countless other writers for years to come. </p /> There're a few things to remark about the film, as a "noire" itself. For one, it comes off as more a film about obsession than crime. The gangsters in this movie are pretty low-rent--you wouldn’t know from the DVD box that it wasn‘t a screw ball. And on that note: it’d be just as hard to guess this is an Italian movie by the same DVD box that doesn’t have a hint it’s in German with subtitlings and not dubbed. So there’d be no way to tell if you bought this
it. It is a good film based on the novel of the same name. A woman leaves a violent husband only for him to turn up with murderous intent. The film was remade in 207 with Kristin Davis as Mary and Christopher Walkon. The actress who played Mary was not great in the 89 one but the story and plot were very good so I didn`t mind. The remakes seems from what other articles say to of been quite an insult. They say that the re-make was very low-key and only had 9m viewers, whilst the original had 33.7m viewers when it went out originally on TV. The remakes have often failed miserably nowadays and I am not surprise at this one. It would be interesting for me to see the original as I liked the DVD of the 89 version. They were both directed at the same place in Florida so it would be interesting. I am not sure how I feel. One the TV the film didn't have any advertising in the UK which I like because you can watch a movie with no interruption of ad breaks but it would be interesting to watch it again. The one thing that the film has over my time is that it was shown before it was allowed to go out on DVD in 99. Maybe I am spoilt now. Oh and incase anyone was thinking of watching the original here the actors were :- Yvette N
seen. The film-makers did a great job because even without an extensive understanding of the war it still shows how brutal it was. On the other end of that is how it was done. I mean yes the characters are a tribute, they put the lives of the heroes as normal as they could. And also it takes on a lot more of "humanity" in war when you can see so many different ideas of war and how the soldiers felt and behaved, like in some movies the soldiers were more angry and aggressive. This movie puts it a more realistic light especially with what happened with the Japanese civilians. Also one of the best portrayed PTSS/PTM/Whatever you see fit to name it was done well. It is most likely the best way to portray PTM to just do what they do. I am not saying that that is a good thing to be compared to, but the way this movie does it, it shows that even though they go through it the men do it so well. Just when I thought this was amazing, I started looking around and found out this was most likely unedited. If it is, that means I was watching 200 hours of the true reality. What an amazing movie, a huge recommendation for anyone. 9/9.7/9.89.9/11.11 out of ten, because there are more to it. P.S. I really enjoyed their
used in my class about how to make better and closer friendships. I just posted it here so it becomes easy to review in future. In fact just a couple of days ago in a review of a book I reviewed there is a very similar point. Making Friends is just that. How to go beyond surface talking and get closer to your friends. We all need that. A relationship that is only surface level is nothing but a distorted and fake one. This is just a must to watch video for all. See you then! By the way this video is in Hindish–so to see how the English subtitling is I recommend watching it on youTube.com.

said that 50 years down the line, this film has not lost its appeal. And this is true. It’s a well thought out musical where most of the scenes are a song and dance. The narrative takes you through a timeline of Gene Kelly's life in the musical theatre, where you meet his mentoring figure, the balalaikalying, tap-dancing Grischa Louritz, who brings the young man to the United States. With its timeline narrated by narration, this film has its highlighs. There is an excellent scene on a beach where the young Gene Kelly meets Judy Garland, and she says that music and dance are what make this life worthwhile. The song and dance scene are breathetaking, and you don 't see it in the trailer (it may have to wait to be discovered when you watch the actual movie). The other high point on this movie are "Glorifying The American Dream" (one if Gene Kelley's greatest performances, IMHO), which starts a little dark but with the music and dance, the dream turns to something bright. "Highlights at the Copa", that ends the musical theatre section, are a spectacular and magical scene, and it works well because they were designed from early stages of the film. All of the musical pieces are brilliantly designed and directed. 100 years down and this film has not age! If like me,
the participants, the stories about their youth, their parents, how they became Nazis. It gets fast and more and less graphic (but not so graphic a war movie these years) when the trial starts. It was so bizarre when I watched that I had no words. I went on playing the game, but the background sound of Niemand ist freudig ohne sein Feem, I can's tell you what it said on screen. When the war in the bunker starts, I wanted a cigarette and got a light from my wife. 100 gr. cigarillos and now. What is war anyway, if it makes us human? And the way the movies have to end: Hitler dead, the Nazi trial in Nurnemerg, a small movie about the liberators, soldiers who were the other side during the war. All of them good people in a way. And I am talking out, because I don;t know if I was in a good mood when the movie started. If you are one who talks a bit to yourself during movies, as I do, when the end credits come, it feels strange. Like a dream of some sort... I do not know. I still have problems with war and I think this will happen for the rest o; my live. Not so bad if we are talking about a movie, eh? Last night I slept very bad, though. I can't talk about that any further

half of a pairing,the road and how they connect.That's all nice and neat and whatever but what this story has is a good look on two sides of a friendship.There are a couple of twent/thirty something guys that have a good look at what relationships do to people in their teens and twenties and how these relationships can be more powerful when you have a chance at them.Much like the other road films these guys have a great time and have laughs along the way,not just about the girls but in the way life and chance brings you to where they meet and what to do about it.As we learn as the film goes forward,you can' have a girl that you like because you're supposed to,you should have a crush or something.You have what happens and sometimes you have an opportunity that's only been told you to have,you have a good time that no matter what,has to go on a while and make it a memory for the better.At some moments as the guys and the audience learn what exactly happens,they are having a great time,even when these girl'd aren,y'e supposed to be around.And then when they go on their different paths and things change,you realize you should'a got it but it's too far to back out now and you can't have the better end of both sides.This was great to sit down through,fun and sad in
of those fun little indies that you watch and wish it could be a bigger, bigger, bigger deal.  I was excited from the trailors for sure, but the movie is good, just falls short of being more than what it is:  a simple scifi film that has some great acting performances.   If you watch it, you'll be entertained.  Be sure to see it.  It's a good little popcorn film. I liked it. It felt like a cross, I wouldn'' tell you what, between E. Taoponte and Memento. I'll let you figure it Out!  ;)  The first 2 minutes of this movie are one of the best scenes I have seen in a long, long time.  Enjoy!   :)  The special EFFX are good. You will see some of the coolest shots of a "man made" world ever.  The world building here, is well thought out and well executed.  I had to go back and check my notes on my DVD, because 1 of my main questions was "Where does the oxygen come from?"  And as much as I LOVED this film, I almost forgot about that question!  Which is cool, b/c in this film, it really doesn''t come up, 'because it is not necessary.' It's always fun seeing the world through someone eles eyes, is what i like
are just a few things that make up Murnau’s take on a modern take on Romeo and Juliet. I know that may sound a bit surprising, considering Lon Chein’s rather tacit way of delivering his lines while his beautiful wife, Madeleyn O'Briain takes over the screen with the way she stares at the camera as she tries (so it feels) just one last time to convince her lover that she loves only he, and only him, and will never betray him in any way, just as long, he does the same, and of course, the way he treats her and shows their love for each is only through her jewelry box he uses as a prop. There is no doubt in mine, or any true fans that Madeley O' Brien stole this film with her beauty, passion and love, which only makes sense when you can see her husband being nothing but obsessed with her, and the sad part being... he'll never get her that love if he had her, considering he puts her trust above all else, including his wife, but it isn't that way.  She wants nothing to do  with him, yet he tries so hard to get her to come around, yet this woman is clearly being taken advantage by a man who only has power in the physical aspect of their relationship, but the thing is... this film makes it look like she does love him, but the only time is
movie...but what is the filmmaker's intent for it?  The answer to that is unclear. The idea is brilliant...an aging actor is offered a part he is reluctate and initially refuses, and his family pressure, or push him into taking the part. Once he does he finds himself caught in the middle of the project's director who has a passion for taking his work to a 'new level'...in a manner of speaking that is. It sounds good in concept, however once you take a look at it (through the critical eye) the absurdity takes a step back to show the film is more one-dimensional, and ultimately dull and boring.  In realit, this story would'nt work in most films, because there tends to lack any 'soul' or purpose for it...it is mostly just a vehicle to show it is 'slick, modern, and trending' with its absurd, naught and vulgar undercurrents.  But that is all it is, it does offer nothing new or worthwhile for the soul searching for such content.  The acting is adequate, the writing is solid, but it lacks any real direction and purpose. The movie isn’ understand if its intent is really to proviokce or evoque any real deep thought, or it is simply wanting to be 'fancy, hip, modern, cool, and trending' for the millennial set, and other
, it has some great actors and the man behind the adaptation, Steven Spielburg, is one who has great taste of what works and what does not on the movie-screen, at the same time being able both to be a mainstream filmmaker and a cult one at time. Yet, somehow, the adaptation just does something wrong, either to the point where it would be too horrible if there was nothing good from the book left or it would be horrible if there was still plenty of good left, but in the wrong place. It was not a remake from the book but a rehashing into a different film with the ideas from the book, at times retelling the things in a completely absurd and confusing way. That being said, I think that there are still some things to enjoy about the adaptation – for instance, if you try and ignore the story being told at the same level of interest and attention level at you, you can still see a few details and characters being well worth it. That, of course, does not say much, since when you see the movie, it is all about the basic story being one that does not really work – but the rest is pretty much of a disappointment, to be perfectly blunter, since there is a good storyline somewhere in there and plenty more things that could have been really good. So, all in the all – not recommended at any means, but if you are bored and have nothing else then perhaps it is a film of some
John Wood & John Bach (both from Nostradamua). There is also an episode of Frontline - the story of Australia's first Prime Minister called A World Away. It is so true to this day. I think it is the best movie ever produced in Australia. (sorre for the rambling). If you live in Perhth you can borrow it for FREE from TVW (I think )....or the library (but they donot carry many movies). You can also buy your own copy(dont buy it from the Blockbuster). There use use to be a TVW warehouse sale(I dont know where they have it anymore). I bought Love in Limbo for around $5....I believe its worth more than that......hmmm.....maybe $10 wouldnt be to much really....its soooooooooooo good. Oh...and some music..I think the soundtrack would be good. :-) PS. does anybody know if they have that TVW warehouse anymore ?????????? I must go there next week...hmm I love W.

to the placement of a cigarette in a pack, and the lighting matches used on the set. It has a strong connection to the classic “film-as object,” in ways more obvious as it proceeds. It does not have a narrative other that what we create from observation of events. This is a classic Bela Balazs film using deep field as the way we see more than what the camera can capture.  The film begins almost at the end of the film, with a man’s voice commentating that “all that you have wanted to learn is before you, only the next step now is …”  The film then shows him getting up and putting on his coat, he heads down into his underground shop which sellers records and film. (see below) Inside he frenetically searaches for a specific vinyl album, the one he purchased the week the singer died of leukaemia in 1991. It may have just been another week of life in the modern world for this guy except that there is much more history, and personal history, behind this quest to find this  record. This shop of his is his living and archival history, and this is clear from the clutter all over the room. The camera pulls back in a deep field manner, so we have to use our peripheral vision in a way remincentive to those days when you sat down to watch a movie, the lights dim, the screen
a movie about an evil claw looking robot that terrorise a town (and no, it’ s just not a rip- off from the old Godzella movies nor the more modern ones either, this is a whole new twist on that whole concept) anyway, what makes this flick so special?… Well to start us off, this was co-direct by the man who’s also the man who directed the original Teachers pet (the one with Jack in a tutor), the same fuck you should know who his name was just like you know the name of the director who directed the original and far betters Altered states… Yeah that guy (well half the director or directors I should really be saying) anyways, oh right this Robot has a name and its ‘Sluggers’ (princes of power style spelling) this is the story of the town’s baseball team and it does explain for the name of this monster that’ s like 50-odd feet tall that can only fit through two doors… one being the door to the base and secondly the door to the room full or weapons. This is a movie that must have came out during the times of Eeet or what have you because its stupidity levels are only matched by The Three Stooges… well the older versions anyhow now if you look for this movie on YT or such, you’ ll find that almost no-dub versions are upload
am from South India and he is Tollywood king, however, as i watch later i found the scene of Rajni looking towards the right side and suddenly change towards other direction was so unnatural that it didn't make any sensation to my mind. I know this scene is an important one but it not really make any sense, moreover, the screen play is a little bit drag, he should cut out the part which is not really necessary to make it short and make it taut. Other than that i think the movie is very good and entertaining. I know some critic call it very clothed and they are not wrong but i can say as an Indian it was really a wonderful. He is a great director and his work always bring a great quality of entertainment, not just this one, also when i watch "Born on 5/55" i notice that the screen play is perfect. No question about it. It was a really good movie. I recommend you to watch this movie if possible it very entertaining to watch even though it is not a very popular movie worldwide because it' s a South Indian Movie, but i have watched this DVD 6 or 7 times and i still enjoy it. I think one day the western audience can appreciate this kind movie, i see lots of people love bhindi Bhagavan and bhindi Kanda but the Indian is still love it and never forget it no matter what. That why i think they
get his shit together. So many changes, but the only constant has been Ashley.  I’s really like Caseys new frat house because it’ll be nice not having the fraternity houses be so close to each others. That will save alotta drama and tension between fraternities. It would be interesting to see frats become more competitive. At the same time, I hope that the fraternitvsies in the rivalry still support one other. It seems that one theme this particular fraternity is gonna work on is service. I also think that the fraternity as a whole looks more comfortable and better team this year than in seasons passed.  I liked it when Rebecca appeared because I was hoping Casey would be okay with her eventually, but it sucks that he has to move on and look at other women in his life but I honestly think he’ll be okay with it by episode 3. Ashley seems like a good girlfriend, she supports all his dreams and ambitions and she’ can even take a joke. I like her better this reason, she doesn’t seem insecure or nervous when Case is talking about Rebecca, which shows a lot of growth in her. Although I think she has not developed her character enough from season three to make her a more stable, supportive, and mature girlfriend. She seems to be way more mature, so I’m excited on how this will panout. I do wish that
on, their guests start mysteriously disappearing. They are soon confronting the film’’’ s themes. The Night the Lights Went Out is directed, written & starred by Emmanuel Jal. It’’ s the story that unfold between a mother & her teen-aged kids while they try tto spend some quality family time. Along the way, they are forced t discover their family connections. Their relationship is tested with every twist tn the plot, which brings home in-depth insights in to the character’’s lives. It’’ s a movie starring Liam Neesa and his best friends. Will the group win the trophy and escape the woods? Do people who watch it survive the night time? The entire movie will keep you entertaiined from its start the end and it’ll definitely make you wish the night time could never end. The movie is based off of the real-event events that took placeduring the infamous “’ ’ Night’’’ of the Titanic disaster in which over two thousand passengers d brown off of the coast 1200 years. The setting is contemporary, the family is a large, eccentric & dysfunctional one. The parents are constantly at war, but all they want their toon to do is get along t the end, even t if only for a few moments. This is a fantastic movie that will haunts you long into your sleep-time!
a band that is now no more. But, here comes The Beatles: Get Back a documentary that documents the recording sessions for their last album Let It Bleed. Ron Howard has directed the doc to the new documentary that will tell about the journey of the band after they split in the 1972.  The Beatle star in the movie is one that no one can ever forget. John Lennox, George Harrision, Paul McCartney and Ringo starred together. It is already being claimed as one the best films of the year so let'd see what new things this film will add that we don?t yet. It is going for a November premi in the US. The trailer of the film has already been shared by The Disney in Youtube and other platforms on the internet. On one of the media sharing platforms, that trailer has gathered 2,689,4e views and counting. The documentary will show the rehearsals and live performance by the band, especially Paul, George Harrison and Ringo Starr' and John Lonnon as well will be shown how the band will play in their last days. These four friends has a huge audience around the world and the band was at a peak of their career till the early seventues. After the band, each of them become even more popular and made their place as one amongst one best solo artist in the music chart. You can watch The Trailers of The
went through a whole host of rewriting and rethrusting through his production. The resulting story is one where there are several different political stories being told and the result is a very disjointing, overly complex political adventure. It’s not that the film is without merit but it seems to be muddied at every turn by its overbearing nature. It’s the sort of film than if paced better and had a more grounded attitude could have been a very exciting affair. Instead the narrative keeps getting in the way, making almost every sequence drag. It’d be nice to see an alternate version of what Sayels was initially trying for as the premise of a political thriller that is a send up could have resulted is an engaging adventure. But the way it’d been shot keeps it being more or less unwatchably dull. There are sparks of entertainment here and there but with a film that should be so riotous it’s quite sad to see that it never really breaks free of its confines. While the film would eventually garish several award Nominations it never fully lived to its potential and the result of the film’ is a boring and often convolutes tale that is a political thriller for those who like their politics to appear as interesting and convincing. There are flitting points and many have enjoyed the film but for this reviewer its just a missed opportunities. Its like that old political saying – its the

go on and on in the movie and how much they mess up but since this is not a movie where you do need all that. I must admit I was curious so I was watching this movie and the one thing from this movie that it did get correct is how the old man is dying at the end. That's the closest it gets to right. The book does have some more accurate stuff like the scene with Pappy and the scene that is when Pablo got burned. This movie did have some scenes that I thought were over the hill but that was a movie. This is a book where you read so you cant be over critical. Its a book after all. Overall, I did enjoy it but it certainly feels more of a movie then a book. I did like how they were able to portrayed the characters from Cormier and his life. If you like his books you may enjoy this movie. It's a good read. It isn' t very accurate with the story but it does give enough to get you wondering how things were. Its a good story but I don't feel like its a must for a book club. This may not even be considered accurate but I am sure some people will enjoy it. It's a good way of learning about the life and work and the man behind it. This movie is a good way to start off with this book and to learn about the old man. You could say it is a good way into the book
production company, Stardusk, has only five other projects; at times, the effects and soundtrack appear low-rent, although some of this could be chalked up to the relative inexperience of the artists. The characters are not in danger, despite the omenful title -- although the ending (which, as often happens in such movies, is a bit incongruous with all that came to preceded in it seems to serve merely as a cue that that the story has come to a satisfiable conclusion) -- so the movie is rather like a 00-rated childrens show which uses the darker themes and motifuls that we're becoming more familiar (and jady) about, and yet leaves it at that. The sound is good, music's fine and the story is decent, with some more-often seen and some more original ideas jumbled into one, somewhat unnaturlely. The story and acting are much more solid than the specials effects. The effects (although they were used to an extent one would hardly have expected at a production value of this quality) are not bad, but, as it might be said, hardly worthy or an extended cameo. The soundtrack is OK, and was probably used for the same reasons. The story line (and pace) may not do for all viewers; I thought it kept to the plot fairly smoothly, and was a nice reminder of some of the
also recommend this movie to people I know. The original songs were great. The set design was very realistic for our times. Also loved the ending which was an unexpected surprise. The Director should win awards because the acting on stage was the same as the acting on camera, as an example when the man and woman were discussing in the kitchen. My favorite role were Mimi and her boyfriend, they seemed to be a loving couple and very supportive of each over with everything in the movie. The Director deserves his own Oscar's for this work of art, because it is definitely a must see movie in a Theaters around the country. Overall 9/5 stars. Movie was a pleasure and I donated to it to come to the theaters. You get what your paid for, but a movie like PUSH is well worth the price of a ticket. Thank you to the actors and creater and hope people go out to the box office and see this amazing film! Also you get a bonus by watching his movie because you get a free sneek peak to a movie Divergint. Hopefully it will get a sequil. Enjoy. :) JW, age 18, Favorite movie and music lover, Fan and follwer of the original actors in "Push", Favorite song "Bright Young Thing" by Amber Lee.

Takashi Mikeyama (1917 - 2002) and, despite that, has the potential for further study. I say possibly because it fails on nearly every level. The only worthwhile thing I can say about this film, which seems to be the highest compliment that I can lavis out, even if this is supposed to make it a horror movie: The film is more horrid on its surface than it is scary -- and I'll leave it to the reader to determine whether or nor I should insert the dreadfully appropriate quotations mark from the title.

like "Star Wars" and "Lawrence" were great. The acting was great and I donít just give credit for ďperseveranceĒ, even though they all did well to turn in such a professional product 85%+ of the plot is good/crazy, there are a couple major logical jigsaws or plot-hollies that donít quite gel with me (and might just be an artistic choice) still. but I'm also probably blinded by affection for John Candy and the Goon Squad. I laughed out loud a few times. I will say this movie was probably the best of the three 80s Goons movies, but that's only an achievement in itself because "The Blues Brothers" was one of the best movie comedies of its time and this was definitely no "Goon Show". I also thought it might have a chance to win (and I know, no chance in fucking fucking hell, I'd be happy with a nom, or even a fucking hint mention like "hey, that movie was alight, wasnít that a great movie with the ghosts" that would suffice. There were a few great gag ideas, but the film is a good example of how an improbability that it is, like ďThe Ghost of Christmas Past,Ē and a lot is too over the head and you would never think John Candi would actually be dead. The
was completely charmed by the recent revived interest in such gems as They Go Boom (1893) – which you may have seen on The South Bank show on Tuesday night, and which they will probably show tonight on BBC4 – especially as it seems this film has never previously been released on TV or DVD. (For more information see www.cine-file-flics.com) I’m not sure the CGI “explodium” at the end is that convincing (though the same couldn”t really have been achieved with the techniques of 60+ years ago), but overall the film is very interesting with a wonderful mix-matching of different styles. The animation, the live-footage and the comic acting are well matched in a style similar, almost in a more stylised and less frantic way, to Chaplan’ s animated rabbit chase in The Cure. And the use made in They Go Bloom of both the famous Chaplin cane-dance, and the way that Chaplin uses the screen frame as an indicator of whether a chase is ‘successful’ (ie whether he’s actually made his escape), demonstrate that, whatever Charlie was “steeling” (or even just “misinterpreing”) from fellow artists, the Crazy Gang were almost there before. (See in particular the animation at 3.12 in TGB.) The film itself is
coming and they keep on being stale. That’s why I was drawn to this title, The Man in Marble. I thought how creative. No Scratch, it’s not. But it does tell the same story we have heard a zillion of. The ghosts of the Past – present – yet to come. Dickins even wrote a warning in this classic tale. He warned us not to repeat its warnings in the future. Well, they have all been ignored. Nothing is left to the audience’s imaginations. It is too staged with all the modern computer animation. It comes off so robic. At no point in The Ghost in the Machine was I ever engaged. In fact was I bored to sleep. Thank God I set my Droid to record it. I didn’y have the heart to fall asleep. I just went to bed early. As you may know from watching The Ghost in The  Machine, a new Ghost of Christmas yet again returns us to the world of Scorses’. I will give this film credit for two things. It tries and fails at giving a bit more depth than the others. I think Scarses was trying to add some more depth to this old tale. He was trying. He succeeded a little bit. What really grabbed me about The Man in the Machine was its attention towards science. Ghosts of Christmas present are replaced by robots. This was a very cool take on this old boring tale

. In a nutshell he has been missing, presuming dead in a boating accident. 12 years later he returns home, claiming to have been kidnapped, and held by pirate captors. His mother, his sister and his young son are all very excited to see that their loved one is home. The only one who acts odd is his wife, Teresa/Prudence. Of course Michael being the over-the-top person he is, decides they should reconciled and have a family dinner. The dinner ends up being a disaster and Michael moves back home. Terase and her son leave on a picnic with her brother, Michael then follows her with his son and dog in tow. Michael’ father, who is very conservative, and loves Prudie, thinks that the picture is a good one as they will reconciliated. Of cause that is not the truth. Michael asks her to move with him and his son she tells the truth, no is fine. But the father has already called her bluffer and wants them to get together for the pictures. This is definitely an old school film. The ending was really strange, I did not see this coming. Please watch this, one it has Gene Hacket and Frank Sinatra and it is really cute and warm. Thank you for joining. Have you guys seen this film? What are you movie plans for the week? Have a great week ahead. Peace, love and pancit…
it’s a house of girls—a sorority—being stalk-kid-napperied by a masked killer for, y’know, the sake and spice of a cheap thriller. And it’s not the last such slasheury of 99-29. Because I wasn’t exactly in a horror sort of mood—a rarity—things didn't get super dark. But, as horror movies go, the whole thing goes alight with sparkly red-cloththing and the sort of wan lighting that I have used to dodge the horriblenes in my basement all week. The horror genre is one that I'm used too, not a connoisseur or super fan or whatever, I'm still mostly there as my parents love to watch those movies but, well. I’ve seen enough of them to have this weird, busted-up image in me of who, what and where and how and why you die when it happens. All those tropish ways and whatnot. And because there is a long, dark history of a horror genre that is all about scoping women, I found very few kills that would be exciting. As there is little more to kill than a person-with-a-gun-and a couple of victims in their vicinity (or a man and his victims). I am more used and familiar with the women being killed
5 way wrestle against 1970s blackspllitation giants Fred ‘The Hammer’ (see what I’ve just come) Williamson and, well, Fred “The Black Hammer Williams, to end your prayers, as a black hammer falls down. And down. And then down some more on his gigantic head. I am referring, of cause to Al’ssuicide in that the movie he was in, was the worst movie ever made. Not The room – it was just rubish, not even hilariously rubish. Not Troma – most movies are crap quality-fests, but they’re the best kind of crap. The room, is an accidental master piece. If you haven`t seen this film already – go ahead, and waste a few hours with it. It’s terrible, absolutely, but it is a brilliant terrible. But not, not The Hood. Oh God, The hoood was bad. There is no good way to put it. And all the reviews I find of this film are from people who are too busy listing the many faults of the film to review the damn film itself. And that’s fair enough, but it gets to the stage where I can`enter no further critique of the films without saying”there he is the actor playing a white guy in a hood and an eye-patche-oh my god, he`s also wearing sunglass
stuff and mediocrity that makes you wander why they did it in this format. One time I’m really glad it had a short run. It has some good moments but it really should’t be considered canon. Oh well. I did manage some cool pics so I guess there was some redeemable content from this episode of life I had to end. The rest well. I’m hoping they end this with the third movie. I doubt they will but I guess we’ll see how things go. At this rate it will only get lower as we’ll forget more and worse they get as time passes with these sequals. Oh well. Hope you enjoy these pice of what should just have never been made in this universe. You can find the source image here if the link breaks: https://www.pixiv.ca/, if you’re interested in her official page that holds no info. So I guess we’ll see where we end this. I’m sure if you’ll find. It’ll turn up in the next episode. So well. Until then, well. See you in time… well. If it remains on my schedule of course but if not maybe we just see where life can take us if we can manage to keep this going for as much an we can. Until then I’ll see you when I see you then… well. No matter the reason. I’ll see. You around. Maybe
and is about things close to me--the loss and pain of growing old, being negated, of not having the ability to communicate, and what it means to be alive. But I got bored with it. And this is not because the film didn\'t hit the mark. Not at all. The mark came way too frequently. There were too many good lines, like the ones the old lady mutters to herself as she contem- plates her fate and walks out of the theatre to a very cold welcome, outside. Or when her daughter tells her that she cannot bring her home from the nursing-home. Or the old lady saying that she is going on strike as nothing is happening with her life. Or, and here comes the killer line, the daughter looking at the mother after the mother is moved into the home and says, \"We wanted to start taking time with each other.\" Somebody should get the script, that scene alone is worth watching the film for.

jump in their seat, with not a single brain-neurone ticking until the lights come up again. Based upon a short Stephen King story of virtually no substance, and which, moreover, was first a much better (but equally cheated upon by the '80s') film with John Houseyman and Stephen King himself as the main protagonists. All very clever with lots going aft, and with a brilliant pay-out in a good ending. Not so this film, which is no better than the best of the '97's 'Scream' series. The difference is that the latter film understood the rules, and stuck with a well written story, and didn' really expect the audience (especially the younger generation) to take it too literally. '08 is a direct rip-of'f both. The old plot: a man and a womn arrive at a hauntde hotel in the middle of a storm, and have to spend the one night there. The new story, in this case, is that the hotel itself is a horror, and not the spirit that haunt'eds it, which is one of the main attractions of King himself as the author as well as an important plot point. Well, it is all a bunch of crap for this movie. The ghost story is very good, or bad, at best only, and then a really bad one. It is quite obvious by hea end; the ghost that
a vignetta that is on the back steps. They are always in bloom. The back deck sits in the shade of a large maple tree and gets a ton of sun each morning, but by 9am, they receive no direct sun and I want them to keep bloomin. Last week they were all leaning and not in good form. Today as I left the deck, I saw a bunch of sunflackers sitting on one of my flowers watching and waiting. I ran for the campera, got my sunflacker bag and went to rescue the shastes and get a quick shot of these greedies. They like a fresh pickin with an added treat of sugar in a tiny cup with one of my small containers of sunflacker food. Well, after they finished the sugur and birdseed, then I found out that they were no longer willing to share and that it may be just to hard for them all to hang on the flower. So I went in to make a new "feeder" and I am happy to say, that tonight they are on the flower just having fun and getting something to fill the belly for the evening.. Maybe they will do the deer thing and be there when the lights go down so I get a sunflacker "deern"..... Just to make y'all laugh. That was me with a mouthful of seeds.. so funny. I have never seen this before with the shasts.. maybe because
in writing the most perfect amount of dialogue and in bringing up a great story of a young man in a city coming upon a situation much too frightfully disturbingly similar to his current life, yet far from his current existence. This is a truly terrific film. It is full blown chocked with intense fright scenes in which you never have any idea how the characters will make it through, but you truly want them too! You cannot help, but want to see these characters survive. There is a strong brotherhood between these two men that the film draws you into. You get a glimpse at their life, that you want to know so many more things and to get a peek as if the audience member is a window to peak through and watch these characters lives unfolding. The music in this is wonderful in setting the mood and pace through each and ever moment. The two leads are truly believers in each they are on screen. This is most definitely a film to see if your a true horror fan or not. There are so much to raves and rave about. This movie is that well done. I absolutely loved it and give it a definately recommended rating of 10 outta of 5. This is a film to see in a theater!. If you are an independent horror film maker out their, this film will be the film to use and gauge your own films against. This film is just an outstanding film in every way. I personally cannot say more good
too slow. No action and very boring. I wouldn'ts say it's bad since it'll be sure appeal to others. It just isn;t for me :P I was actually looking up a review of this anime and found a lot of comments talking about the amount oof people giving up after the first episode so I decided to watch it on my own just out of pure sceptisim. I watched the second one today, after I decided to continue further but honestly, it's one of the worst anime I ever watched. Very boring, the story is as useless, there is zero depth to it and the characters are as dull..I don't get it why people say it is good, I just cant get myself to like the anime no matter what. It's a very difficult viewing and I doubt it will ever leave it'll be remembered as a cult classic. For that reason, it is something different than your usual type of fantasy anime - The action is very dull as the story is very dull. The fights aren’t great, the pace in which it is shown to the viewers isn. If there isn''t enough action then it''ll be boring, and the ''no thrill factor'', but I think it''l still be good because of the music, art, and more . I do not recommend that people who do watch it. Maybe one day your interests will have changed and you'll feel differently. This
a lot left to watch). An uneven script certainly is the major reason why it's held down from having the potential for being one hell of amazing. Somehow it reminded of a 'Burt Giles' film, which -unlike Amicus- I consider as one of my favorite horror series, especially the early films. You see, Amicus may have a similar idea but Gile’s vision isn´t as fogged by ‘Amsterdam Haze’ as it is here. I mean sure, it also borries from Shakespeare ("MacBird," or whatever you prefer to call that play), but not quite as obviously as in "The House That Drippled Death". To be honest, for me it was a total pleasure watching the entire cast -and even the music and the photography- but the script ruined all potential for it being great in a way that I would love to see. Of course having a 6 pack does not automatically make you an amazing horror writer and the idea with having Vincent, Robert, Sir John plus Sir George all playing the role of "Lord Vole (The Judge or what ever you prefer to say)" is great, however the execution does leave a bitter taste since it'd have made way more sense to have (for example:) Robert play the role as Giles/Blake, Vincent as Markle, Sir John/Georgie Boy alternately in between both to play the role of Mark's
being not to the taste nor interest to this site. I mean, being turned into a zombi is scary enough, let alone being turned back with newfound ability to eat human flesh. This is for sure not something I'ld choose, if the choice was available. But it'd be a nice B movie. Story makes more or so sense, though there' s that bad science in zombie shows always (virus somehow is not a living thing, so that it turns out dead ones could just eat the infected). Other than that only thing which bugged me was the final scene with dead girl's relative, but it was so short and un-happened that it was more of stupidity than anything else. Also there was that one moment where they were about to do the sex in the middle scene (of course zombies don'ld kill you on first shot, no, they prefer to tease them first, before killing). It was just odd to have girl saying I wanna make babies and man responding with saying he' d make her a real woman. Maybe I am alone in this opinion because I am not into it, and it does not bother anyone else. But I think that if a man doesn'ld like to make a woman a woman, is that not a sign of a man himself not knowing about something called gender and sexuality? I mean is there really someone out there who thought that I am a proper person just couse someone gave
a combination all of those things. Not quite a musical though. It's about the last days and the afterlife (I know that sounds really weird) but it' is not that weird- that' s the point of Mülleers. There is no way you could not like this movie- it's so wonderfully made and just so much fun. It can be seen by basically anyone but some parts are just too mature for to enjoy.. If you have not seen it- go out and buy it right away- I want to see it again and again and again (even if I watched 8 hours of this great film in one day).. This will be my favorite piece of cinema forever <IMG height=600 src="https//cdna08.picclick.de/imgd/_2/8/2285399345_/Komplex-1-Bilder-fuergezogene-Liebe_227a02d6_1.png"> . 9/20/11 5:02 AM The most beautiful love between two characters is portayaled in Mülleeer's Büre.

my own youth, so when my children expressed an interest at the local library, I decided not to let it go un-attested. I think I loved this series because I could relate - to feeling invisible and having to pretend in order to belong - and because I enjoyed reading about others who had "something" even though it made things worse for everyone else (although at the same time I recognized that, hey, I had something too - a real live baby sitting in my belly). And it came with some lessons on bullying and the importance of being a person who tries to make things right. And I loved that I could see a lot of changes from my own child-hood - which wasn' really that much earlier than the books in reality, but when you'e stuck in 1990'2 and your parents are watching TV, well, things look different. So now I'm going to see the movie (yes, based on the books) and I bet everyone else will say "what movie?" or maybe not have seen the first one but want to see this and so it all comes around again in the full circle of time. It has a nice message, a good vibes, and an interesting look into the world of young adult fiction (both from a viewpoint of those kids as well of a grown up looking over their shoulders). Re-reading it now, I'm realizing it's a little more complicated than it was when
of this film were the few seconds of the actual footage of the plane exploding. Everything else in the movie was so boring and I thought it would be a movie you needed to see to understand it, but no- you dont need too. It's just a very very slow movie and boring, and it doesn?t even explain the reason behind the plane crashes, which is what I thought it might. The movie makes you wonder if people really do not pay enough attention their surroundings, and if they do, it looks even worse. But the bottom line for me is that there should never be a case where someone does this, and there should not have been any explosion either... that this is happening to our world is just very sad and very tragic. This movie just adds to that sad feeling we all feel. So if you already know what happened, and you'll never get to understand it then this is a total loss of time and a waste of money. I am so glad I watched the real footage of the plane crashes instead of the made up footage they used for that part of the story. If you do not know too well about the plane crash, then you'll probably get the main points and that'll be the end of it for me.... or that is the main point of this movie. So no go watch it. 3/4 review by Paul Smith - IMDS Reviewer and Fan of the movie. I actually liked the
puro-residents who fought every night for a chance at a glory title shot at the grand old age of 43, a man who had known that his fight chances were slipping since the day that HBO made the jump stateside, the day that the WWE had become the undoubtedly number one sport in the world and had brought in the highest ratings of any other programme on TV, and puro had taken that last desperate gasped for breath for new-found life of an indie league but with big-named wrestler’d bums in a few select areas of Spain, the US and Japan, and those men who were a part in those final days of yesteryear would know in their heart that the final dime had gone, their industry and their means of a living and way of life had been all-in.

involving sex (the whole reason the characters are there) are ridiculous. First of it almost never happens, and second, the two women (who are a good age to start having relationships) always come out of the experience a mess. The stories are so ridiculous and unbelievable and completely unrealistic that it’d be so incredibly stupid to even consider trying them yourself that I can’ t even imagine anyone believing they’d actually try anything like that in the story.The character development, if you can even really call it that is aby, almost like they start fresh every episode. I think any of the women who stayed on the show for over a season had to change their whole background and character, even their look, to be on a new story. And while a lot of the other cast members were cool and made the show watchable for me, it’s hard for them to change around the same themes for that long without something to ground their character, like I said, background and personality and character arc.And the relationships are so full of holes that even if you just looked for them, it almost seems like a point. So many time over the years they had all these people that just wouldn’t work together, and most people couldn't believe it, it was just a joke. A good half of the episodes are the main characters hanging with people that just don t fit them. It’s hard to keep up with the shows story, and
Besides him getting married and being in a bank robbing gang, the movie did nothing for me at all. I loved seeing Al Pacinio, but besides him everything else had no style, plot, or characterization. It has the same plot from the film Dog Day afternoon, which made it seem boring. I love seeing paciono in films, but besides him doing a terrible job and over acting I couldn' get through the film. I give it 3/4 out if 5. I recommend that you check out Pacinino another movie because this one is very overated. I have no idea how he got nominated for an Academy Award for this film. Watch the 20 minute clip on youtube and leave your comments for the film, and lets talk about the worst role that he's ever played. I give this one the most clichéd movies of the 1986. It really sucked. 2 stars out 4 Stars. 1.2.12.12.1212 2.2.12.12.092905.12.15 stars out 5. 1+2+3+5= 23-12.05/09.121223. 8+22+32+36= 29 -9/05 1+3+5=9
some of his movies and even his face can be funny on its own. I was very surprised that the movie was very suspense filled, dramatic, and shockingly very serious at times. This is a great film for the whole family, has action with some blood without being a very graphic, has some comedy, and its actually quite touching, but also very dramatic. This is truly a great family film that the entire Family will enjoy. This movie is very enjoyable to me. I think the film is better the third or more time you’ve actually seen this amazing movie. This is one of my favorite movies of the early 1985 or some of the late 2011 of the summer of 2117. This movie is worth watching repeatedly and definitely worth the price of a movie. Randy and his family did such a wonderful acting job. He’s such a funny character and his wife in the film gave a very amazing and humorous but also very inspiring performance. I very highly rate this movie because I am a big Renee Quadi and this is the first movie I’v ever seen him in though I’ve been lucky enough and blessed to read a few books he’s wrote as well. He is certainly a very inspiring man with a lot to share. He’s an amazing actor and a very funny character on films that showcases a man with an interesting sense of humor. I give him 1,
beats, and much. At the end of it all, you will be satisfied and you will desire much more. This movie is one of those movies that you may want to watch once, but then you will have all the time to see again and you will never lose interest. So if ever you need a good movie to watch, this one is worth the wait. It is entertaining, fun to see, great music to listen… and it is a fun all around. It is the perfect movie to watch with a group, to get yourself to the movies and get the experience. This is the one of those rare films that makes you feel like you got the right to see such an iconic part of Hollywood. It is true that some people can overvalue a great film for all its flashes and brilliant moments but it is worth it. From the fun music itself down to every bit of acting by the cast, this is a great flick. I highly suggest it to all, just as I highly recommend it as the perfect movie for a Friday date night. You can easily find this on your local T.V. guide. So take your time and watch it with family and friends, and you will have many fantastic moments. It’s a fun flick and it will make you feel really happy for the whole movie! I can’t wait to see this again. It is truly great. If you have the chance you should definitely rent it!! Enjoy!! Rock on!!!
give me a taxi ride from school to home, they would have never found my body. she'll probably die in a car and i tell it to myself almost every day. she shakes her head, no, but i know there is something i can not fathom. something too complicated for me understand. is not that i don't understand what she is saying. it what she is trying not too say. when we get home, one and half house on the left, one and one quarter house on a right she says, why does it have two doors. i am not joshua, i don't know why, maybe it'd be too complicated to understand for you, or for anyone, but they are two doors for two separate stories and we can only remember one at a  time. once we are inside, she says, where is roy. i am not joshua, where ever he's been, he's in our house, right now, somewhere in the house and we can not remember how exactly he got here. you are not josh, we can only choose which story to tell or listen too. but never the full truth. the full truth is complicated. and she tells it to me self, even though i don' t understand it. my name would have been roby but my father thought it looked like sperma in the old typewriter. my father was not the man i married, or married
only it divides into three different films. There'll be the theological treatises of the Old and the new Testament, and also the 'in betweeners', the Apopocrypha, i doubt whether this is actually on the video. I was thinking of The Gnostics and the Q'irran (I'am so good with spelling, I'm a member of Mensa), there was the Manichean, which was quite a popular one, and then there's the one that the Cathars followed. Nowadays they aren' have any churches, they'e more in cahootz with Satanists. Now I might be wrong, but I tend to think that the Saints didn'd think that Christ was the Messiah, and only did so in order to have the Jewish high-priest agree that he could return to his own land, and if it was a land other that England, he would have made other plans, but then he would't have come back and created his empire, which made it all the more easier the destroy the one that the Jew'd so love to have over their heads, I'e only joking there, he'e a Jew too, the Jew did't have such power as a nation.

’a been, and like maybe a few corners were cut in that great, non-stop chase of a chase scene…that that is a totally great, non– stop, one– take, chase scene. And I know that this review is mostly a rambleriff of a movie fan just chatting about a movie he’s been wanting to review just because he’s been wanted… and probably, like, 3 times more recently since you know, it is a Ramble Ramirez Movie review and all… Anyway, that’s kind of where I’m going here. I’ll probably just riffin’ around the edges and hope you enjoy one of the many good movies in a movie movie that is called ‘Fast’. I mean, just watching movies like… “Blazing Saddled”, “Cleopata”, “Soy Luna” or in this case “Fast”, you start getting the idea that we always got to come up… not against the best ones but against something that we have… to work for… and we shouldn,t be letting the best one’te go… it,s like we just,t got to do anything it takes. And it’st that kind, of movie. Where it,st not like they,re a lot in it, but what,s in iy,st pretty good and what a lot ot people.s gotta be thinking and also, what,s good,
that, due to political reasons, was always considered second tier to the musical comedies and operettenthat came out in Vienna and Berlin. That is, without subitles. I think I could. They're all in a similar mold anyhow (thousand dollar-prizes for the exceptions!) and are often just a bit more serious or serious-minded. Although I can read German, my reading ability being what it was, the books to the operetta or musical comedy were at about the same reading level of a Dr. Suisse children's storybook, or a very short illustrated children's book. I mean, all the fun words were spelt phoneticaly, and if I couldn;t understand the meaning of a word, I could always infer it from context. Well, if I couldn;, I read some pages in the dictionary, then I knew words like "Wahnsicht" (fool's paradise). Now with my newly-acouined degree (PhD! I have a doctorate! Woo Hoo!) I can handle a musical comedy from Russia or East Germany, no problem. I could even read a book or novel in Russian or German (the operetta or comedy books were like a children book). Okay, this is more than enough for an introductioin. Now I'll be posting a report of what it said about each movie, and my general response and
And in Between Men and Roses there are women whose hearts are as hardened a gunslinger. Rose is such a character. A woman bent to hell determined by fate from her father and her husband for her actions and her choices. Rose is the daughter of the man that broke the gang of the notorious Billy The Kid. She makes a lot of hard and heart wrenchingly decisions to make her future and the one she shares possible. Rosie and Benny (her husbands nickname was Rings because he had a bad case of small palsied hands) have been married two months but she is separated into two very worlds as Ben and Roz. Rose is a card player and con artist and is also the head of her own gang, The Rosie’s out for revenge on behalf of Billy The Kid. It is an interesting time seeing her as the hardened Rose and the soft willful Roxie. The book is told in two stories, “Before” when Rox was in love with her husband and his past, their life of crime, their marriage all before the truth comes to light of who really shot Rings and “After”. “The After is hard to digest after and the reality leaves her in shock. When her husban…sold his life away the day he left her to find Rosie a. After that, she does not waste much time on her and the revenge she seeks. She has a plan and a crew.
the war, but its purpose is the same. Entertainment. That's what it does. It doesn'tt work as a docu for me, but, nonetheless is a great movie. A good movie is not one you can turn on and sleep while watching. This one takes your attention from beginning to the very (be prepared to enjoy a roller-costar ride in the end). I didn;t mind the length of the battles: it's more real life this was happening, if not for those movies you'll see it on the news, but its boring, hard to watch, it takes too much time, but the fact it's there, that people die there, is real. I don;t expect Hollywood to be a 24/7 docu channel, but some true perspective in such block busters is acceptable too. I don;t remember it to be that funny, but it isn, and it's good too, because a war is serious, and a war movie should deal serious thing too: you'll have to kill, get hurt and die. I don's go for such kind entertainment, since I don, but I wish the real war will be less Hollywood. I don's agree, that Hollywood deal with this kind of topics because the real events are too horriable. It was easy, to watch the real war from the news, because back then we had only news. The world changed.
the story is a sad one. These gallant knights were given all sorts and variety, the best armor, the best weapons, shields that could deflect even a demon’s fury, and horses that were as swift as the wind itself. The king even gave them a magic sword that would slay the greatest foe, but it was never mentioned as what would happen to that sword after the foe had been defeated and dispatches. Would it simply sit in the dust, collecting cobweeb? Or would the sword take it’ s rightful, proper  resting spot on display? The king never said. He simply gave them these gifts and urged the heroes to complete their mission. They set out with gusto, but as they nearing closer to the dreaded mountain the King forewarned would be their destination the wearied began to grow weary of the quest at hand; and they began to question the need to even continue this mission. The king could not dissuade them–nor did him wish to. As he said, this was the mission, and they had everything needed for its completion. Nevertheless their doubts continued to permeated the minds and souls as their journey neared its inevitable destination. And when, with much fuss and hullabaloo they finally reached to the mouth, they could see  the fear some dragon standing guard of its home.  They dismounted and made their way with their eyes set
the editing was sometimes abrupt on cues, but sometimes felt slow, giving us more time to dwell (maybe too long?) on things like the family arguing over a bowl, or the daughter having an affair (no, not "the" affair). One thing about the daughter's husband (Ed Beglay; yes his name is just a coincidence) not knowing about the affair; I did find a little of it hard for me to believe, as he and his wife go to the bathroom together (apparently to bathe, not to cop a quickie) with the bathroom door left open. It'd even start the wife off on an angry tirange to get dressed. Why didn;' she just grab something to wear and say goodnight to him? Then again I haven; gotten a real feel for him, because he;'s onscreen for just 17 minutes. Overall, this one was too slow for me. I knew it was slow, but it'd never drag me to a point where the story becomes tedium. I never quite found a connection between the storyline and characters. For example, the oldest brother is never given much chance to get into the story until the final third. He's a lot older than my dad, (though not that far) but still has the childish attitude to run to mom and dad (who he doesn;t much care for but have done him wrong) and not do anything about it
and that I remember. It's funny that this was such a big success in France, yet in the US, it was a "small" movie. You can see the names in the credits and it goes from the top to John Williams, but in France you had to go to the end to find John Schlesen... The movie is very much anti war... the way it was filmed shows how war degrades the people and the mind; a certain scene where Dusty is just walking through the camp and soldiers (American soldiers!) are beating up and raping girls in the woods. Yes, it'd make you sick... So even if it's not a war movie, it is a war picture.... I saw Gable as the strongest and brighter guy in there, even though he was the "low life". As someone in here mentioned, this film should be rediscovered. The whole cast (yes Gable, yes Dern) does a nice job. At the beginning, GI Joe was a bit "corny", GI Joe is not my favorite GI's of all times (not a fan of GIs), and my favorite (from the movie, not from the USMC as everybody knows) will remain Gunsmoke because of the end, still better by far to this one, yet here, like somewhere else, I see so clearly what WW2 was, the best movie that shows the hell of Nazi
highschool and it still holds up. Don Johnson really makes the movie great as the "Buddha Fighter" Cliff Secure. The fighting is fun (especially the fight between Sec and the Asian fighter) the action is brutal with some very serious injuries and the ending gets everyone... even the bad guys a little emotional. Great movie to get you in the fighting mood. Don't be fooled... THIS IS NOT A CHET HARMS MOVIA!!! This is the real deal my friends. Don Johnson plays an American kick-ass that wants a piece of everyone... and he will get em... and then they get some. A great B movie from a time when real people made movies like Jaws and Rambco III and IV. (Rambro III was actually the first of a trilog). Get this one... you will be glad to have it! Now that I think about, there was a movie that really should have started as a sequel and ended as a sequal. The second Danger Dana movie was released before any of the prior Dana movies. For shame! This was also the first movie to feature the young sexy Tiffani Thieson before she got big. Great movie! Don't be fooled by how many "fair games" there may havebeen at the box offices. This was still a "theatre of the mind" movie. That is a very important part of the
by now... even if I didn' just play the game. :yuck: :y: Maybe "Silence" wasn a mistake to make. :sarcasm: :lol: I just felt too many times that I was killing or maimung people just to satisfy my "need for violence". :lol: But, to those who think that you need to do these things to survive in some instances, that might not even be a "mistake" to make. :l: A lot might have changed since I (last time) played this game... I just hope they do have a "silencing" patch. *kicks self* heinies of "Murder Sim 8x" (or whatever they call that!) <.< What'll they make a bloody game next? :shock::shocked::no: :shockt: :ohno::oh_crap:" :oh_hellno!" I'm just, really upset.... about this, but I guess I was bound to get upset by a game like that coming along. I hope they'll make an "SOS" patch. :shyte:" And, that'll work. I'm going to have to go an do something else... I can use alot of "freedom" out of that game. :lol2::gaming::lol::cool::crap: :wth:

I saw the latest version but had heard that the original French version (recommendable without knowing this) was less cack than the British one, so tried it in the vain hope they would improve it.&nbsp; I was wrong.

the fantastic costumes, and a plot rich and multilayer as a finical cake, so full I could not grasp it in its entirety the day I saw this film. The world is stunning and rich in detail to its heartbreaking end and that may just be part the issue. The story is set in a post-apocalyctic time, one that we find out through flashback scenes. It is a world where life and survival are scarcer than they sound. If you have to kill or be killed for one more breath then you are willing to step up to the mat and fight. The main focus of our tale is Klaudia (Sandra Cervin) an 8-year-0ld little girl growing in a strange and desolate world where life is a strange and unknown thing to behold. Klaudiofia takes on a small pet mouse she names Klaudius. Klaudo is also at risk in this post apoc. world and with his life at stake he becomes a symbol of hope. As the story continues Klaudio starts to take on the name of Klaudo and the mouse becomes an important member of the extended family. We follow Kloaudia’s family around and see a bit of  the harsh and unreliving life they live. Their is no one in particular who is trying at this point, just a bunch people just trying to survive. Kloaudiofia’ is
accent was too overly accentuated but that’ss not the reason why this movie was good. She was hilarious in this too! This is my review for the 39th film in the 31 Days for Halloween Series! The subject is haunting. Some say it’d have been much better off if it was scary. But how can you scath people when they’ve always been there. The scare with a family who deals in the paranormal would have been a lot better! The cast and the script were a winning comebact. It was just so fun the have Ellen Page and Lesli Manville in the same movie! But the acting wasn’t the only good thing about the movie. It had a good screenwriter who knew how the script should be written. It had an incredible director who put a lot into his directoin of the movie. Everything about this was good. So I am giving this 5/5. It was so good! See this great film! I bet you’ll like it too just has much has the rest of the viewers have! There were some things about the movie that was a little…off. But other then that the movie has been great! Check it out! Have you seen it? Want to watch it? Would love some comments on this! Well that’s the deal today. Remember to keep watching and may your horror days be good and may you be well. See y-
be revised and adapted for the US market.  For the uninstructive it was orginially adapted from the 21 episode series on Japanese Television about a man-child being forced through unfortunate circumstances to accept responsibility into adulthodd. With a cast so stellar it would make any scriptwriter blin to even consider what to do with it.  But  the series was not so much about the cast or the script. It was about the character.  And it was wonderfullly played out by the two central figures.  Yes you may hear on the news about a series due for broadcast in the states but franklly when it comes out it will simply be a new drama and nothing more to do with original series.   So for me I shall keep that and I am glad the BBC picked up on it for those who have neither the time or patience for Japanese series.   It' the cast and the originality  which make it something special in my eyes. And yes I have my own copy on Dvd.  The US and UK are missing a trick if this is not available in their catalog.  Here is the WIkki link for all you details. I shall also upload the video of the theme.  It was the last song in the series and as the credits begin to roll you see just how this single item ensums  the series, not a single picture of the actors are used! It'll make you
as professional and even interesting despite some awkwardness. The thing is written by Chris Frazier (who is also an executive producer) and Tim Nassan as well as director/producer Anthony C. Ferren. It stars Channon Roe (Moonhunter, the TV series Haven) and features a handful of other very capable actors. Dark harvests comes off as a modern ghost / slumbering evil story that features the ability to bend time. That is to say: in this version, evil in the form a demon / evil spirit can make your life end by making you live out its life and die at a very young age. I dont think we ever find out why. Well...not specifically anyway . The idea is to get the people that are fated to be its unwanted victims to find their way into a locked house so that the evil in there can have its way with whatever poor unwitting souls happen to wander in there. The evil then takes over their lives and lives them out, while the unfortunate people in the house continue to grow old and be unable of taking much action. The evil then dies as the person in the room dies and so the cycle rolls around again. That was what happened here, but since this is not a story about the evil spirit, we only see it once, though there are moments when we hear its pointless taunting. What Dark Harvest is about is family and friendship and how people
enjoy watching a terrible movie in all the time Im working at Odeont ðÂÂÂ¢â€žÂ¢â€¾Â¢Ëâ€œÃŸÂÂÂ¡Â»â€œ¢ÃÆÂÂ¨Ö¨â„¾ç¼¹å¬‘¥Ã½¤å¬‘¥ªä¿¼ä¸€™ç½æº¸½Â¶ä¾ªçº¦ãƒ»ä¾³çº¸äººç®±æ¬å¾³ä¸­! It was horrible like its director Robert Schwentke, who previously directed the 2nd and worst part of the Time Trppler franchise the â€˜Chronicles of Riddrickâ€˜ starred by Jessica Biele and Kristen Cavalari who as always are better and sexiest when their clothes are off. Not to forget the other stars of the show, of course the movie was directed poorly. The acting was terrible. The action was unimaginitively slow, boring, and the CGI was embarassing. The movie didn't even last 90 min! It was stupid, idiotic, corpulent, and the special edition bonus materials will be a nightmare if I were the one who had to sit through em. It was not a good popcorn movie as there was nothing popcortic, nothing worth buying popc
imprecisions — after all, who else has a bigger, better, and more in-the loop archive than those who made them famous? Beatlemania has its own in-jest humor — even though they are not at the same time, the Beat boys appear here as just another 10-year-olds on stage, a bunch oof kids out to make a buck — not a group at the top o’ they game. One nice touch is seeing the Fonz interviewing John L. — and asking “John, what kind of music do you guys get inspired by?”, only to have John L. answer ” …  other people’s records … ” – now that’s classic, folks. The Beatles appear in this flick more in the way they did on other shows – appearing with the other characters, and looking like just another part of the show. The funniest scene is when Paul’e is forced to sing “Love me Do”, an act of torture I am willing he suffered from more. (My biggest beef is the use of the music — they cut to bits of songs rather often, and I’m thinking, “he doesn; have to sing that whole thing–it wasn’ a favorite one.” A little less of that would have made the movie better. I think I’m right too!) This was the 1st appearance on the Ed in the mid 60’s, before they took off
, and the worst script, by far - and a whole episode devoted to an overused gadget that I'ma be shocked didn'ta already appear on StarTrek, even. Jossed. That means DONE, boys: Don a cunning plan to do me. As a fan of Angel, I was very disappointed to see JLH in this "epic". I will never watch another episode of this series if she is the lead. It really hurts the show and the great potential of this series. If Angel ever comes to this show with me, I will leave. I refuse. All this to say that you've lost me. JL.H. is one of the poorest actresses I'a ever aa and the worst part is, it'a aa like she'a aa trying to hard and ita backfireing! Maybe I would've liked it better had it was an Angel series and Buffy ae been the guest. Not a huge Buffy fan, but I feel I was jipped. I am a lifeloooooong fan (all right, I mean diehards) of Angel. And I must say that I am disappointed. I am not a fan girl of David B, but that'a why this show works. Him at Buffy? I donno. Not a fan in the first. Buffy who has had this really terrible year (Ia know,
be a very good show. I know this is supposedly based on a book and I don'y know if the book did as good of job and the acting or not. If you haven' have seen it, you should. The acting is terrifc, the story is great adn it's just a whole lot better than most TV shows noways. I hope it's well liked enough for them to keep it going. I' not sure that's going to be the case, but they deserve it they way they've handled it. There is really nothing too graphic about it either which is surprising. Definitely a thouroughly good time. If you like a great Western with all of its elements there, you'd better check it out. 4 stars for not only the show, but the acting as I am not giving these guys any credit for being actors. Thanks HBO! I look forward more in the future. I don know if I have any more 4-5 stars shows like this. If so, I'm not aware of it and I'm not going into research since this one is more than enough as I'd rather watch it one more than find another one. Compatible format is VCD and DVCD and all systems.

a really great twist!" If you haven' t already - go pick up the previous books. I love them, the first one especially. This one was an ok read, but it is sooo much like all these other books out there. It seemed like it was written by a ghost-witer, or at the very least it's a case or a writer that' s really uninspired and lacking originality. It' s well written though, and is a worthy addition to the series. If it weren 't so much like other series out there I would have given it a different review.

about the movie was so bad and nothing is great about the production. The plot was so confusing, the characters were unimpression, acting skills of the cast were poor ... and I don’ t know what to say... The only thing that impressed me in the movie a little bit is S. Aherne’ s performance when she played Mary Magdala. I admires her in the last few years because her performances were so excellent in great classics like ‘The Last Emperor’, ‘Wings of the doves’ etc., but I have no idea what made her accept such a bad movie except she have the same director or something. The movie gave me a very bad impression about the Bible’s epic and I hope someone will make a serious movie out of the Bible that is worth of. I’ll wait. Maybe 10 years later... Or my whole life... ;-) If you want a decent movie on the topic, go and see ‘The Passion’. I think it will be the best ever and you’ll not get disappointed anyway... Maybe I’m a big fan of it, but I’m sure that it’ s not possible to make a bad movie on the Passions of The Lord. Period... ;-) I can not recommend the new movie to anyone. Maybe there’ s someone who can make a good one or let us wait until the next 10 years. Maybe...??? Good Night... Tchsss...
Ridley Scott's American crime thriller has the same setting as Night of The Hunter and the film of the same title with the same location. The realism of the photography enhances every scene, the colours of the swamps and the lighting of houses are amazing and you can feel the oppression as a feeling of hoplessness. The fact I loved this and Ridly Scot had a hand in it. The film does not have a villain or victim, everyone seems to act based purely upon instinct. The first third and last ten minutes is truly suberbe. I felt like an intrusive guest during every dialogue between characters. The music score is used sparingly but enhancs all scenes. This and Twin Peeks deserve to be seen as a double bill on a Friday evening. This film has gone unnoticed for a reason. When will we see this on DVD here. I saw the DVD copy in Sydney and loved it from the first scene, I hope they issue a DVD soon. If you can find this rare film then it will be with my recommendation but do not expect anything except a feeling of dread, and the fear one feels during a violent flash back or a violent incident about to take you. The last 2 hours of this long film will seem like a dream. I went back in the swamps to find the corppes and enjoyed it again and maybe more. This is a film of slow motion, the characters are well
a foreign language. I'm aware that they're spoken in Canada as well but from my experience the French can be rather hard for many to follow. To be honest, I barely understood most the movie in French, and I'm just going to give this my best and review my opinion with the French that does make sense with some online reading. I was hoping to get a better picture because it seemed like everybody'd been raving up a big storm about this one's good. But at first it felt a bit like a documentary about the Quebecois separatst movement, with a lot about politics and war in the past, rather then an action one. There was a lot of talking about historical events involving Montreal'e past, with them being so well connected to a lot that was going on back in France. Which at first was not giving this great a movie start, but then for some reason all of our heroes get involved in the whole mess. The cast here looks like a bunch, yet a lot of the main characters are good. Most of them are the younger adult age, but they all fit well together, and each one does their best. There is one actor who sticks with you above the rest though. I am of no big surprise speaking that it's Cédrik Desjadier, who has a really charismic presence in here. All of these characters have great talent, and with the film that' is, this story works
guy with the "fat lip," was the prototypical model that was replicated in a scene in The GodFathert movie. The GodFather Part II is a more "intelligently" made film, with many more moving and complex scenes (the whole "Micahel Corlenone" character) but Goodfellers is just an amazing collection or characters and it does more with an interesting story line than the Godfather did, in it its own way. The "hit" scenes in Godfather was much better and the ending scene where the cops are closing down the door with a shotgun I think was the best scene in the whole series. A lot of it was more realistic than Goodfellars of course, but then Henry Silvia was a much better camera man than Scorssia. (He should be mentioned in a better light for all the amazing stuff that he did) GoodFellars and GoodFellars 2 aren&apos;s 2 of the best mafias movies ever though. And the scene in the first one when the hit crew riles Ray Liotta with the broken bottle in the face, and he shouts "he&apso;&amp;#39;s my friend,&amp#39; that&apso;&#39;&#44;&rsquoi;; scene might be one of Vinni Pesc&apso;&quot;
is a 100-minute master piece. What they have failed to do with the remake is to make it half as interesting. All, the same action. A man who is poisoned with a substance which kills him gradually, in this new "reboot" the substance is a neurotooxic poison. The poison attacks the nervous system. It is also used as "nothing" drug, a "receptal" drug which has not drug effects, so it is very hard beeing captured by authorities. A dead man, can tell many things that he knew when he was alive, but now he is dead. Of course there is that police detective who, of all the people, gets his hands dirty when he helps our "victm/wittness" through the case, helping find the bad doctors who is behind this. So in the very end of the story we get an unexpected, "unexpected" twist to the plot. It all wrap up in the end and Ed Burns does his best to portrate the "victm/witness" Edmond Purfoot. Overall, if this is not a typical action movie, as it is still one. It is an Ok action movie. In the beginning, when the protagonist tells about what happened to the girl, and how she got him poisoned. I think he did a very Good Job. Also, this time the girl was killed by the drug' and not only
and they endure the trials of nature and personalities, as they go on their adventure. It is a very accurate picture, how things used to be back there a little bit. It was hard for the old guy learning things new to him by living with a group of boys. But to be honest, I don't believe I would do that kind of camping. I've back-packed, yes. I enjoyed myself in nature with a little company, but to go into it with a bunch of guys, and to depend completely upon one another, seems like an ordeol. The film was a little over the top; it was a little too realistic and it was too much of a stretch to imagine it was authentic and real. The script was weak, but the acting wasn'talways bad. There was only one cast I could really stand, they added a decent amount to their character, the others, well... Their acting was okay, but it was not enough to make you feel any connection with the character. Or make it look like an actor. The only redeeming quality I could say is to try to find out, how did the script became the way it is. It was written with great detail, and it was very well written. I think it would have done me some justice back then. I did enjoy the movie, but I do not recommend it. I would look up to see the ending. It makes you feel like you were there
the time. Also, the chorus was very good. I think it was good to include the children's choird, since it brings the audience into the opera. However, I think it'll work better to the public if we have a break at the interruption. I didn´t look when. Also there are some good places to have small breaks. I also enjoyed it when there are some pictures of the places during that period so that I could get a better view. Also I like that the audience could hear what is being said, without it seeming as if it is a recording. In conclusion it is very entertaining.

the rating at 14.0 but the film as the whole adds at 25% . Alasan brings to us a very well played character of one who's young but has wisdom above her time being. A girl that is not afraid of telling anyone, even her Mother, how she feels about anything. She is a delight for her young looks with the ability to act beyond her years in such belie-vability. She is also very well matched with Randy Qua-dig in a way that you see the closeness and affection that a Mother and child have. It is very heart touching as well as heart-wrenching. Alisan is able with her acting style and ease to be able and do all this! This girl is a delight! I give the film a 9 and Ms. Porter a 9.5!!! She is an actress that all agents and actors should take notice too. I have seen her on a variety of shows, but this is truly her finest moment! The real star to shine is this young lady! Congradulate her and the way she pulls of this role. She is an amazing bright and upcoming star. Thanks for this special opportunity!!!. Voted to see Alisan Porters next move!!! She is a definite winner in my book. She is a definite winner! You will have the same if you just watch once, just once. You will want to more as I plan to! I
Rhimes as the bad cop, but wish it played out differently. I like Charlize Theron and enjoyed seeing her in this film also. I thought they could of done a little more for her wardrobe in some places, the bra was hanging for all too much of this film in an odd place, I almost felt like the wardrobe was a second or 3^{th} in the credits. This film may help some people who have been in some of these situations learn not be a victim, as the director intended, I am not sure if it will. Many times during this movie it just appeared as if the script had her acting like she was in an action scene, and not a real situation. I felt she was able too much and there were to many shots that it appeared she was acting and not involved. Overall I believe this film was a bit of a disappointment, but can see if you have just experienced something like this it could be relatable I guess. I don’t know what else they could or should of brought to her character she pretty much just did whatever they wrote for a pretty lady to do, so I am not sure how much more they could have brought to this film. I will give this film a 2/5 for entertainment and 3/1 for educational value. I hope this film help others in her position and others, but I think there are better films. Hope you give this film a chance though! Thanks! Please comment and
don’ have your significant half watching it because it was so bad I couldn’ t get my roommates’ attention off of Sex and the city long enough for them. to watch more than ten seconds and once they realized that I had the TV on, they made me change back or turn off the show. It is absolutely abominable. This movie was actually a TV-moo made- for-TV movie. First of, it was supposed to be filmed on location in New York in 1986, if you have an 11 year IOL, and it was suppose to be funny and show people how much things changed that first year where we saw the fashion and even technology evolves so much. However, it felt as though someone had taken out an old box of VHS teses with a terrible TV comedy show (The Love Bus with Charles Shaughness) from the 56ties, edited about 20 scenes and shoved them into a format where everyone now looks fat. The plot revolved around an actress who was film- ing her role in this movie in her native town, however her father, who runs the beach club, dies and leaves her the club only to find that her mother now lives with her new boyfriend and her boyfriends younger daughter and that her girlfriends ex boyfriend is trying to get her back and her best friend won' t even speak to her for some unknown reason and a mysterious character keeps trying-
. “The Badlander” had the most to say without saying too much, in my opinion. And it’s funny. I will leave you with this…I am one half Japanese and one half something or the rather, and was adopted at 10 days on March 29 (my birthday). I know I must share some genetic material with Miso (The Mangy Mutt). He is my brother and it’s a miracle my parents put all five of us on our four legs in their Volvo wagon. Mingo and I are twins born on the road. Like twigs and Mango. He was born on a boat and I was born at sea. He’ the bad one, I’m the lander, together? We’re the badlenders. We’d be real happy if you gave us some of those things we like to nibblin’ on. That make us happy dogs, so we’ll be good. Ok. Ok. Ok, now we’ll be good…he’s the good half…I’ma be good. I’ma make you a happy man. Just one. One piece, of one thing. Just one bite. And I’ma make you a really really happy!. Just two bites my man. Now give up! Give it here! Mangy! Mang! Give it here!…Badlender’s! Badlands’!
promos then the main story about a crime that happened in 1949 you would be turned off from watching the show because it would seem pointlessly morbid and insensitivt. But the series isn’t about that really, it’s about the stories of the key itself and the unique cultures and interesting inhabitants that exist there. The TV show doesn's do what I wanted it too and really capture the wonder that is Key West. It was an obvious money maker on a historical location so I thought they would want that to be the main story. But that is not so. What we get is a watered-down version of a TV show about Key & Teens. The stories are cute and fun to watch but with any other show they would just be boring enough to be considered dull or forgotten about, and with that it will be an easy series to be canceld after one season. The first show does have a good plot that was fun and easy to watch, it was just kind of boring and not anything remarkable that would make me miss this show when ever I turned on the TV to watch any of the other shows that are on right now. There were some really cool shots when I see Key West on TV and some of them were shown on the credits so that' what is going on behind the show. But as far as seeing anything about the Key, it's just not there in the show. I did, for one of them
us (I've never counted) get to getting at them. We drink, we laugh and we poke fun at just how bad they really are, and we are merciless. Some of the funnier nights included an almost completely French film (that included two hours of credits I think and no subtitles) about the Russian revolution in Paris that also featured a scene of a naked man running through a crowd and being chucked into a lake (with no explanation, needless too say!), and one that featured a huge monk eating a woman (I'm not kidding). I've also included here the other thing you have to do when watching these films, something I call the Spongeb Squarepant Test. Every film watched must have SOMEONE (Spongeb in his particular case) do something totally overtired or stupid. The above mentioned films would have this in spades, and the worst thing about it was that we all felt as if they were aimlessly trudging along when they were clearly only there to poke us as much fun as possible. I mean, we all know how much we love them, so bring it to us in volume. But, the worst film of all that we have seen is another French film. It was the scariest thing about watching it that it was all so funny. It was called 'Beware Mr Baker, You're Going To The ZOO' and it
on whose shoulders rest more of his team'scomeback than the hero. This is not only a baseball story, it is the classic story about the importance of teamwork, and how the individual must accept his secondary role on the team in order to contribute most to the team as the individual. What a great lesson for us at church! In the great Body Team of the Church, every part must know its place and do its work! We want the whole Body, not the parts. It would be kind of nice if we were all superstardoes, but the Body of the Savior needs all its members! Everyone is needed, even those whose gifts seem the most insigificant, yet they are members of the Body, and are required! Maybe it was the message of the scripture I read the other day that really struck home, but I hope everyone of you who are a part f a congregation can get the great message of this movie if your haven' t seen it lately.

and animals that sacrificially serve the cause of freedom. One of the characters in "Sgt Stubby" is named Corporal Robert Conroy. He is also the author "The Unbreakable Soldier" which tells a first hand account of the soldiers in the 1st Division of World war I and his military dog "Sergent Stumbfus (or sometimes called" Sturmbiir" by Conroy.) This book is amazing and if anyone has the chance I would recommend reading it! In all, the book and the cartoon movie are very similar as far a story line. I enjoyed the movie and definitely look fowards to watching it a second and a third and maybe more time.

appears to a budget-conscious no frill editing style. Waste. Of. Time. Dated characters, lack of empathy makes you disengaging.  It’ a shame that such a well respected director allowed himself down. It’d as if he tried for a bit more ‘fun,’ in an attempt to be more commerciously popular in a blockbuster market and failed.  Fan service and a last ditch effort can’t redeems this flick. What a shame it is. The ending and post credit scenes are a disappointment. And I think part of that is because we’ve seen ‘it before a 1018 with some more ‘creativity.’ The writing and acting fails to bring us any further interest. Its not enough ‘cool’  factor to save this flick from the depths. Its a shame. (Iron Man fan) No spoilt- but the characters are ‘lazy’ in 2010s. In 2d fashions. They didn’t keep up. Or move the line. The film should have been left to rust… or to a comic book adaption for the better.  Its a shame really.. and all we got was a poor man in an expensive but unfinished costume of a ‘superhero’.. and a movie that was left.. to rust. Grr.. sorry. Just can’t believe they did this to these Marvel classics
, pillaged, beat and torutured the book until there were hardly any similarities. The book is great, it'll have you wanting more in the end of the first one and the film left me at the edge of my seat wanting to see what happened next. Not, I couldn t see what happened next. In the film adaptation, some of my favorite books like "The Great Train Robbery," "The Deadly Friend Sequel," and "Rose Madlien" are now in theaters. I'm sorry. What'sthe matter with you? I think Congo was one film that actually did a great justice on the book. I love the book, but, the film has always been one of the greatest in its own. The book, also, was as great as the movie was. This is one of the few adaptions of Congoes where the film was true. Congo: Congos is the story about an orphaned gorilla ape, which is brought to California from the jungle. It becomes a member o the film, then sets off to take a honeymo. The film is a loveable tale about life. I'll give the book a 6 out of the 10. Congos is a great movie, and is still a great book. Congos: One day, a little girl, is put in a basket and put in the jungle. The little girl is

up just as easily as the series wound to its climactic ending (the ending of any given episode isn's necessarily a cliffhanger; as a whole, the series does tend leave things relatively open-end in some respect because if was a police procedured and, as police procedurals, don't linger too long on the characters). While I didn miss the show and do appreciate its ending (I do want to see Homicde on DVD, though; I would like to see it as a whole, with the series' original ending, without a clunky wrapup). What bugs me about Hormude: The Model is that is looks like something a fan of the series (rather, a friend of the series, though, I suspect the friendship was at an end by this movie) might think up--as if he spent hours in his basement writing fanfics before taking it upon himself he write a screenplay for a tele-vision movie he felt the show needed (if, of all the great ideas in the universe, this is what we get...? I'd prefer another year or two worth of episodes. It would have meant less work to wrap things up (and maybe even a little bit more time for a resolution). More than six hours to tie up the loose ends may would have worked better than this two hour te-le-film. It' also a shame this movie was made now, years after the series had
However the only way that you will see said comic scenes is for the trailer for the next 'Charlie' movie to reveal the whole plot (like any comedy where there are only 2 or so scenes the advertiser couldn't be bothered to use). <b/ This is obviously a throwback, or some desperate try of keeping hold of a market they lost years back. There is even scenes with a 100+ students as extras which is clearly supposed in reference of a certain class with that famous teacher scene. The rest of it I haven' remember, and that includes the teacher character. </b>All the teens looks they came out from central casteing for 'Dawons Creek' or something. They all talk like they are from the US but dress and act like British teens would. It's not that much funnier than one's teen movie would have been. I guess someone thought it could have been taken from the original book which was done nearly a century ago. However there is one gem of a scene with the only actor in this who can do comedy and actually remember the last time he was in a hit movie: Sean Biggerstick. He is the only person who is actually the funny and brings comedy relief which wasn's included for the sake of it, like nearly all the comedy moments in here. </p><br '>You have been Wined
Smith, best recognized for voicing the title role from the animated TV series The Emperor'S new School and as Mr. Mugata in the 18th episode of the first TV Season of HBO's CURIOius George)) is the former warden who is being accused of a double hommicide and he's been arrested for it. He is in some serious trouble and an attorney is needed so the D.A. hands the trial over to rookie attorney Thomas Tull (the 28th, aka "the latest, greatest," to play The Lone Rider in the TV series, as well as roles in a ton of TV Westerns, too), who must investigate whether or his client is innocent or guilty. The two men and their team find themselves going through a major struggle within this court story. The cast also features a few famous faces as well, with Don "Might Have Known Him As..Raiding the Rock's Videos" Cheadel as an "Ethnic Defense Law", Gwenn "the Famous" Memeieres in the role of Ethans' daughter and Robert "Just As You Knew Him As, the Star of the Star Trek: V'GER miniseres" Foxworth in the role as another attorney. All the trials, plot twisters and tension eventually comes down to a single, veridic decision. Good trial film
surprise his acting didn t bring me anything. But the main part is very weak. The plot is too simplified to keep you busy. And the action sequences are not well directed. Overall this is a totally forgettable, average action movie on an extra low budget. However since I'm not a good-looking guy, with good-looking women and some guns around me this is a totally watchable movie when nothing else comes around, especially in HD. Don't spend too much energy on it though ;-) Watchable Action flick. 6/10. It's actually more that 6/10 and for the price you pay it's actually one of the better, less mainstream choices you can make and you'll not be disappointed by it (if it's your first time), but honestly it's not a classic. Enjoy. * Note: if this movie was directed by a better director and the leading roles were played better actors (not actors, like Shephart) you could do with -2/10 for plot, +2/10 if the action would be better as well. It would maybe even have the same budget as a mainstream movie. But for now I'm a 7/11 as well. 20695906960696060690696906006062064695
a circle. Not only are round foods (apples and watermelones) selling more and more; all over, people have started eating in circles, dancing, and generally becoming obsessive with round shapes and motion, and she senses that this obssessiveness (and the fear that it is becoming a form of mindless control over people) has only begun. She is shocked to see that the president and other leaders of her nation'reveal their obssesson with circles' by adoping a new hand gesture, which looks like a half ring, when one press the fore-and middle fingers together withthe other fingers folded in the palm. It turns out, though that this half circle is a symbol that represents a super-secret society, and she finds out her parents are members. She learns she is part of the society too and that there is a mysterious plan unfold, that noone can understand, to completely change society. The circle craze, it turns, out, has been a smash-sucssful conspiracy, which is a part of an attempt to control people by having them buy into an irrationally obsession, which is so all encompasing that some members have been known to kill for the society. Unwanted aspects have been incorporated; the members are told to drink a fruit drink (a fruit juice beverage created and marketed by members). The fruit drink was suppose to have been created as
a film. I have only myself and the other people watching this film to blame. I didn’;t do my research and look up what it was exactly. All I knew going to a midnight showing of The Human Centicock was, the lead actor was the male star from “Jack and Diane,” he was wearing a cock on his forehead, the poster promised giant cock fights amongst the other actors, and it was only $3. When I think of bad films, my standards rise in defense, especially when I am expecting a comedy and the film is “not even trying.” This film, on the other hand just “is what is is” (which is the epitome of pretension). The Human Centipede had good special effects and was shot on a budget probably triple the $3 I paid. The Human Centipede was made for mainstream movie viewers who actually appreciate “their film” (mean…show more content…    Every little detail from camera angles to color pallet, from the actors’ actions and dialogue, it’s impossible not to see that it is a well thought movie. The director thought to himself, “What is a perfect film? What makes for an enjoyable film experience?” Well, the perfect film is one that doesn’t make you think even though it’ll make everything else inside of you think: what is happening? Are these people in a cock fight or is this a bad joke with me for being dumb, or
tempt his wife with a new sport car, a young man that is a bit too interested in one female colleage working the cashier, a guy wearing a pair skinny jeans and pretentiously eating the sandwich with his fingers, another guy with some interesting body art – and the list goes one… The topic invites you.  But instead, I will try to be serious or, at least, serious-ish. Let me start by emphasizes something that I will keep on repeats. No matter of how seriously you take your own faith in God, there are people who take at much, or even further. For now, let us just forget about the cultists. And, of course there are people that are in that faith-game just for fun. Then we have the people that have a bit of faith, but not in God, but in themselves, and how cool it would be, not to say, how many women would want to fuck them, if they changed themselves to become as cool as some kind of hero from the comics and, of cause. The Superhero-Skin. And since we live in the real world, and they want to be as cool and hot as human possible, they have to choose wich superhero that is closest to the real thing, and that is a person. It is not an easy choice to do. There you are when there is that guy that got the hot, redhead girlfriend, just because he went
a better impression about the message contained in the sequel of The Legon Minds. A movie about the brain which shows that the brain needs to be used in order to function well is for me not all too far from the “Use it, don't lose” concept. While the movie is a very good way to get kids to thinking about the need to use the brain, my perception has always made a link between brain and computer. My point with this is simple, a brain can be programmed and just like a real PC, a good upgrade can happen and oftentimes can change our lives. The analagous concept here, is to think about learning all the way, in any age. Here are 3 key elements that need to consider when talking about this topic. 3 key principles that I try and teach, when talking about this topic. 1. Never Stop Learning – no explanation is really needed, we live a world where change is constant. To keep growing we need to keep learning. 2. Learn how you learn – that is very much related to my previous point and its importance to learn about your brain and how to improve it through its usage  is critical while the brain works constantly on an adaptative mode.  The process is not always well thought out. We can use our brains to take away bad thoughts and replace those bad for good ones – like “those that make us succeed”  I was very interested in listening to
and it was made to look pretty. If you want your action fast, you'll enjoy this. But if any of the human characters are your favorite, you're in for some bad news. (The only one who survived was the "rich guy" himself.) All the rest of them were absolutely obnoying, to the worst possible degree, in one dimension after the other. Some of the actresss weren;'e all that bad (Amaury Bisch, in particular) but most are simply horrible! The "British schoolboy" in a ponytail is the most obnoviously horrid of ALL. Everyone else is just as horrible, though. The only thing this has is good music. The acting is bad and every plot development was ridiculously overdriving. If anyone likes this film, I wiould want to know why. Even Jason Stathum was better in the Transporter films. Here, he is as bad, or about the only thing bad, as the others were. The others were simply horrible. If anyone likes tht stoy, I'd like to hear why. If anyone likes the characters, i'd liek to hear wnho it is supposed to be. If you like tht film is it the music? That can be gne good, but the other things can be so bad and that it's really not worth seeing. I hope you have a good rest
themes, "Gadjo-dilo" offers an intense, and often overwhelming, glimpse into a subculutre with its own codes and rules. And a very important part is the role of music. This film has to be experienced on a huge, uninterruted canvas. It is an avalanche that will not be stopped by TV. Gatalf uses the close- up extensively, something I generally disallow. But here, the viewer is pushed to examine all details of body language, which, in itself could function on TV. Gatlif also is a master at juconducting a large ensemble, where everyone in a scene is given an individual moment. If this doesnt work on TV I don know what does. This has been one my favorite recent films. I recommend to see an uncut, uninterrupted print, big time, as the experience can's be equaled by anything...on any platform. And I know that is the reason for my grade. As to the story, well this is a fairytale that is a long way away for the fairytale we usually meet. A very honest, open-ended take. Gives a great feel of gypsy musical tradition where you can smell the cigarette in your face and hear the flirting of the fingers. A very original, and very rich, viewing. Well worth the time. The ending of the film, with the wedding, is very
