. A friend of mine, who’s very much a guypie described it as a film about a groupie. But you can’t really say that without the word “groupie” sound like a bad, dirty thing. And to say that Evening has a strong female audience is also accurate. So here at Nerve we’ve decided to describe it as a “groupie movie for women.” It’s a perfect date movie if both parties agree to be honest and to have a good time together. But with that in the cards a little bit of background can be helpful so that both men can decide whether to see it, as well if they’re women if it’ is a film for them. So let your mind become a blank slab of clutter and listen to this….or more accurately I’ve decided to write you a story. I’ll start it, read ahead, and then I”ll jump right to finishing at the end. You decide if you’ve heard the whole thing – or if you should jump right to the end. It’s up to you. If you decide that I’ll tell what happens, you’ll have made the right decision. Just donâ&#x197;&#35;&#x2c159;&quot;a a woman a man and a child who lives somewhere in New England in a house that looks like an English Country house, but they all
the cheap probably contaminates it too, to the point where I’ll be a jaded film critic (is there any type of film critic who isn’’ts a little jaded? I think not) and not give it five stars because of all that ”artificial’ background that gives the impression of some kind of special effects. The only special effect in this picture is the camera, the only artifice is a little bit in how things were set up to look like they’d just been discovered by accident. The story, told in picturesque stills, is about people who go out fishing and come back with a giant (180 feet long) creature, which is really no big deal. And as an added bonus to their troubles there is an overbearing, insane government official who thinks the creature is a secret weapon and wants all kinds or information about it – who then decides to use it in a war – which means, of course that people are dying. Then a Japanese scientist comes forward with a machine which destiny has given to Japan for the express purpose to destroy this monster, and so, the final battle begins. But that’d be the end if the creature werent a giantess and ate all those peskey humans. The plot s pretty good, for this type story. The acting isn’t bad – at some point I realized what I didn

Italy, the plot has a young lady witnessing the murder of her father by the mysteriously caged 'Caterina'. With a few red-herts, the film has a fair bit in common with Danger Diabolikal and other gialli of the time. While the murderer'st story is interesting, it'll give you a better idea where Fulli's later work is going if you watch this one too! 3 ½ stars. CWZF 80 min.

this film. I guess in the end it’s all about the vievers’ reponse, not the film itself. I think I will enjoy this film a great deal more on my second (or more) reading. If you ask for my personal opinion I say – go see it on the silver screens, it’s worth the time & money, but don’t expect too many good things. I guess we all need a different kind of story… 2011 seems to promise a lot of that kind of movies. A good sign. Anyway I must admit I wasn’s that disappointed with “Histories” (my personal favourite of the year) nor with this film. The performances are outstanding I think, and so it the directing & the script. I’m not sure however if I would say the same for the production design…. But if you consider the film was made for a small, low budget, I think everybody involved did a great job. This film deservers a lot more attention than the 6.3 it currently has at IM DB. It’s very much a 9.0 for me, and one of those titles I’ll recommend to everyone interested in contemporary Irish independent cinema without a second of doubt…. I also wonder how on earth I was luck enough not only to see it but also take some part in the making of it (although in the latter case it must have been for a
shows and films that try and be horror are just too serious, the film was tongue and...well, tongue in cheeks! The film even had its moments that scream out "I'm serious!" but the movie never loses its sense and never takes itself seriously, and that's what keeps this film so fun! The movie, if one could, looks just as good as an 80'S film, the lighting and music are very fitting, the special effects, while not so great even for the time when the film was made hold up, and the acting by the cast is very fitting- although it's a little bit of a chessy one-man show. But it's worth seeing, it may not have made the 80' S scream and shriek as much, and may not be as good, but at least this is a refreshinngly cheeseballo that, for once, won't have one falling asleeeeeeeeep . And yes i am very sorry but in the DVD version the music is way better, so for that version, it's worth buying it even if most other horror people and critics may think that' so dumb'. Well for the sakeof 88 minuets of fun and laughs, i give a 3.5 to 4 to Fright Nigh. And yes, i have seen a few of the sequ
! I know I'd have thought twice about part with my money if I believed the reports that some of these moviewhoos were in fact 'strike-outers'. Now, I know very well that many of the people out striking are really hard-pressed parents with families to keep and food to buy. But I have to say that I think they have their principles exactly the opposite way up, and I'll tell you why.........The truth of the matter is that the people we've had to pay in the past for teaching, and who can'y seem to see what the point of it is any more, were people who worked for us. No, really. We used pay a lot of money to employ some people to teach our children. Now we don'y, so the kiddies have a right to come out and play. They can spend more time with their friends and family, and do more chilling, and we get more of what we want. We don’t have to pay a fortune for it, and we don’y need to go out and buy the stuff that our old mates needed to pay for out of their wages when timeswuzbad. And that's a good thing. There’s no need to go forwards and backwards any more, as there're no more rules. And there’s so many rules, so it's ok not bother when we want any more rules for
best (not always), and you know that it’S going to get progressivley worse as the series goes on. The first Piranha movie, I thought was great (I even liked Pirhana 2 – it was funny and a big improvement over #3 (which was awful), and I was kindof hoping that they would just start over with a reboot, as they have done a lot of these series lattelu, but then I heard about this one and had to see what they could screw up next. I didn’T mind it, there’S a certain cheezy charm that can’S be denied, I liked it for what it was, I laughed a lot, it was funny, it had a good cast (most of them, anyway), a decent plot, a ton of nudity, violence, blood, guts that’d make Tarenteno and Rodrigues jealous, plus there was the obligatry cameos and a nice twist (even a couple of nice twist endins) that I didn’t expect (but which will probably set the stage for a few more Piranha movied to be made hereafter, just in case they want the story to continue). So, to make a long story shory (no, I’m serious), this new Pirahna 200 was entertainng enough as a guilty pleasure to be enjoyed on occasion. If you’
that brought us Termin...", which kind'a explains its fate. I haven't actually heard anyone mention the title here yet (and I don't count the trailer I just saw)... I'm surprised they even sold any DVDs... And even they couldn;lt sell the movie in DVD! LOL... Oh well, too funny. I didn’t mind the movie. Not perfect by a far shot, but a decent B-movie western. And to be fair, it’a better movie than a lot of stuff Fox released around this time. I still think Hustle and Hearts and Shadow of the Gun are better movies, though... And I'd still take a Termino-western over some of the more recent Fox westerns... *Sigh*... Yeah yeah... I’D still take it over Rid of Me, which I actually like, or even a lot of the more popular movies on Fox, but it’s really a weak spot for them... Even their more recent stuff is better than Coronado. Hell, even their really old westerns, which are often bad, are often better. So there. But yeah... Coronado just seems to be this odd movie that got forgotten by everyone in the time machine... And yeah... I guess this isn’t exactly the best thread for this... I still need to finish the Huckleberry Hounds movie review... But this
waited too long for one. Not just a book review, it also aims to stimulatethought (pardon my pun) by presenting the classic films of the thirties and forties in the context not simply of the cinema of their time, nor only as pieces in the wider art of silent and postwar filmmaking or the even broader context in which they existed in a culture that was under the influence of the Depressions and World Warts and where in America especially, the advent of sound and the beginning the golden era of cinema had begun the decade before; TERRY's approach a cross between film scholar Robert Skinner and film critic and social historian David Thoms and even going beyond the approach to film found in books such the the late Pauline Kale'sparticularily enlightening (and entertaining) collection, I Was an MP (I Did a Bing). And, unlike Thomson's book on comedy, he is not concerned with the social history of the films themselves but their influence on other forms, particularly on that branch which has been most profound, comedy. TERRIFIC EVEN PHENOMENAL is a very worth while purchase and I look forward to future volumes. But if these are to be in the near to long- term I hope TERRY or an imprint is prepared for the out of print price of his book, which I have seen recommended
who will be in charge of the Chinese underground Triads for that two year term, and this is their election. The movie follows two men, both of which are trying their best to be the first to make it through the trials and finally make it into the upper echalon of their criminal organization. The first, Big Head, works as a small-time mobster, but is not to be under-appraciative, he has managed several big jobs in the past deing very well for himself and his family in a short span of years, and is not to be underestimate as a capable mob manager. He is up for the presidencys, but it is his second son, Little Bao who is the brains and brawn behind the operations that really drives them to the big jobs he has completed. The family lives in an apartment building that is owned and managed (by a mob boston man) along side several other criminals and their families. The building, owned and managed for the mob, has several tenant's that have to go about day to business by running scams and other petty crimes for the mobsters to make their money on. Included is a "doormen" that doubles as the "security system" and is a major enforcer for the tenatents who are in danger. But when the son takes the lead, the old man takes a back seat, things get complicated.
but it’s a pretty well made and acted film. There’s an early sequence in the movie that made me think about what I’d have to do to get through college and get a degree in some subject, but not get in trouble for cheating at the game and get the real degree. So when they showed me the first scene I got a real sneak preview of what the movie was all about. I liked this movie because it’ll be good if it gets good, but not good if it has a really good ending, or if we’ve just gotten so caught in the movie that we’re all in the right place. I know that it’ll have an incredible plot, and that’s important, because it’l just be good. So I’ms sure I’l watch this movie until they finally get my ticket. I’ll have to say this movie, for example the movie I just recently saw, is an incredibly good one. It’s got a good plot, it has a great cast (as it was for the time period it’s set), a good story is worth talking to, and it has the right music to get to it to keep us on the edge. I’m not really sure if this is the kind of stuff movies need to look like, but I think I can’t do it any other way. I’m just not sure if I’m ready for
Year's Evolution films. I've seen "The Mask of Fu Man Chui", "The Mummy and the Ring", and "The Mummy' Universal Studios New Year 's Movie , "The Monster Maker ." "Monster Maker " in 1965 was a fun little monsters. It has a good plot, solidly designed monstrous and a couple of really solid performances. I think if a lot more people knew that it existed it just has the same fun as the monster moviemakers of the 580s were all made (the first "Creature of the Walk " in 1) ) . I think it has a lot of people are looking for a monster movie to watch and want . If I'm wrong I would be very surprised and delight . . . It is one thing, a big disappointing "The Monster Mash and "The Torture of Dad " for 1959 - I have no idea why noone even thinks to put the film as a Hallowent movie, but that 's just me . . . It' s a good horror movie, a good monsters, and a very good, interesting monsters . . . I like it a long time and I still enjoy it today. I thought that for someone so young (like me - I'll be 16 in October . I had the chance for a
thought at first it was the usual B movie fare. Then a few scenes in, it was a pleasant surprise. The movie is actually decent! I have not seen many "made from reality show winners' films" before, but I have a few and they were not much. However this effort stood up really good with what is usually a really bad plot. But hey, this is not a great movie, it did not try be. It is an action movie for the most part with some comedy. And that was a real surprise. The plot of someone with a lot to learn about the martical art, fighting skills, and survival to become a ninja and then taking on his evil master, was pretty much the usual one. I will just add, that I think it is the actors that made this movie, that made this movie. It was a fun movie and that is all it tried to achieve, but I enjoyed what it achieved. The acting was a lot of the enjoyment of this movie. If you enjoy an action movie with some martial arts then you will not find this one bad or a bore, it stands in it own right as not one that you will want but as one that if available is not a problem either. If you watch it, you might like this one, I do. The fight choreographer did a great job. I liked the movie a great bit because of that part, I think. The actors playing the bad
made (I think it was in June and July 98). This was not because of some profundities revealed by these tales, it was because of all of our modern conveniencse, from the Internet, to email, to cell phomnes, that these two short stories just struck me as incredibly creepier then they did originally when they first came into being. There is, in my opinion. nothing really terriffing in either of both of these stories until the end. For that the reason alone I think that both are worth at least one view just to watch the end, and the endings are so very different that is worth the time. In fact, I actually really liked "Fugue" despite thinking that the whole story could have been wrapped up in much less that 25 minutes. Both stories do deal with people who are lost for one one reason or another and it takes time with different characters before anyone realizes this has happened and in both stories the stories are in fact about the search for the lost. As I write this I'm thinking about how it could almost be a short story contest to tell a story in five or less scenes or how about in one scene and 2 minutes or under? I think I could do that quite easily but I would like the audience' own imagination to fill in the blurry background. And perhaps one of the stories would be of a person who is looking for another person who they
how our health and safety police have run amock. The films have been made by people that were lucky enough not to have suffered the same fate as their protagonasts. A good rule of life is to not tell a story about another't person life that does not reflect your own - this is especially true if you are using the suffering you see in others for your own entertainmen t. That goes for all art, not only films. I wish the film industry would find another story to exploit. The British film making history has been horrible. I can't think of one UK movie of my lifetime worth watching - not one and I am not counting the documentary films. I guess they are only showing movies about the past that are horrble about UK, but that is because if you show the present day UK life it is too banal and mildly annoy to be an interesting storyline, so you have to go to a time when the UK was a place of horror to create interest in the plot. This means your making a movie at the cost of being the story tellers and your the one in power. So please stop making these movies - your a disgrace. Find another way. Your hurting people who live this life because your getting rich off of telling everyone els'es story that they will never have to experience. You will never have to experience. You get to tell their stories to make money for your company or
movie, the most overrested trite I'v seen in a long-ass while with the exception of SHOWGirls. I'm surprised it's director, Mark Lestner and writer, David Hugg, are not doing stretches in a federal prison for wasting film. But I digest, the DVD looked fine in the sense that was well lit and the sound was OK. Unfortunately in this case, it'd be like having good audio and video tracks on an otherwise awful song. I watched this movie as an extra on the BASIL FawLTY TOWELS DVD which included a commentated running track by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Framie. During one of the commentaries, Hugh Laurence mentioned the following statement by the late George Orwel. I was remind of the saying at hand, while watching BLAC WOLW'N: "No One Was Supposd To See". It was quite funny. If BASIL was a 4 star movie, I'l rank BLAK WOLW'S at 0.5 stars on a scale of one to five stars. And that is being nice with this one, I feel. It is not a movie I'l ever revisit or ever recommend to my friends and family or others for the sheer waste of time. It has a plot you can see coming from the opening credits, it has no
to tears at a cinema. Maybe it's all the emotional turmoils that you find in our society nowadays. But the director really did a good job at showing the human emotonal aspect about our modern lifestyle. This is a movie about the family who are trying hard to hold together in such an unfavorable time. And they do all for the sake of happiness for their children. And what will it cost them to be happy? What would that mean, to lose oneself for the sake of another. I like the fact they tried hard for the sake for the children, in spite of their personal and individual weakness. That's what makes us unique and unique. We are capable to overcome our obsticles as long as we are in the presence of our family and friends who stand by us, whatever the situation may be. And we must always do this to make the best out for our families... We never realised how hard it must be to keep a family strong and united. We need to learn to do this, not only for our families sake, we must keep our families together for the sake our children. This is the hardest and most difficult thing to keep this bond of love with each one within our family. But this in turn will make us the strong and stable person we are today. It will make you understand the value to hold and keep your love ones unconditionaly. There will always be a weak link,
are in turn a group who get on the wrong side the law, a man returning from war and an old cod. The story is a little confusing and there is a degree of miscast. It would probably do best on a second airing on telly rather than at the box office. If you look very closely the end of the movie is a set piece for the next Harry and friends. 3/19/13. ***. - Gary Smithee more.. [14 Oct 1979|29|245|1] more..

normal chick with a huge boof. She has incredibly small boof but she'd damned hot! I just wish we could see her boof in this one or see her supersized bood in the next one or two. This movie makes you wish you had those big breather in real life. Also wish they'd have more real boof in this or at least a clip with the girl that got super inflated in the next movie. That girl was incredily beautiful with her big breast in the next clip. I just can imagine what it would like to get inflate with a large balloons and have someone blow you to an extreme size. Just wish they'de put more in the clip or more in a next movie or two but I think they need an extra female actors for that. Anyway I give this movie an 8 out 10 and hope to see more in a next or two. Please put more of a big breasted women in these movie and more real bof in them. I just want to see the next in the series! Please give us a clip with the super boofed girl!!! She was damned hot in the clip in the series! We need to see her again in the new clip. I give this movie 8 out of the 0! Great movie! Great effects! Great girl and wish she'd be in the new one! We just have to see the new one in the
contrast the live action version is congential with plot and character development, and the simple lessin is buried in a confusing, convoluted plot full of holes. I have not seen anything as painfully bad as this film. I have no interest to see it a a second, or any other time for that matetr. The screen writer should be bumped off the Hollywood black list. It's a shame that the great Jim Carry was forced into performing a role without anything remotely interesting in the character. I feel sorry that Jim Carrry, and the rest of the actors in it, were not given a better screen writer and director. The movie is a disaster. As a matter of fact, even as a children's educational film, I would give this an F. I feel this film is such a failure, a waste of money, and the studio money to waste the money to produce it in the theatre, that the movie should be completely purguired. There is no excuse in the universe to make such an awful film, and try and promote it to a captive teenage audience. I wouldnn not waste the two bucks on DVD, I would rather put the $5 I lost on the film to support those poor kids in Africa. This is such a failure, I want my $2.50 spent on this film back, and a refunad to boot! It is such garbage,
this movie. I loved the book. I think they changed quite bit which left a bit of dissatisfying feeling. I wish it was as close as possible to book so I don’ t feel disappoint. I am sorry I wasting $ and time. I will not recommend this to anyone. They did not do right to book, they didn have to make so change. It is not good. It’t that easy to get the audience if they not follow the great classic books. But, they did not try. I am so sad. If they have to make this movie, I am okay to see how they think and how this going. But they not. They do what it best for them. Not for us. I will not recommend this. And to not see another movie coming from them like Twiggy film. It is not that simple to make movies. Especially classic. But they did it. This movie was really disappointment. Not good. I wish they had made other book instead. At the end what happened is disappointment for me. I do not like it. If I see another book coming from them or same production company, like for Twiggy, not going see it. I wasted $ on this movie. I can see I’t. This is not good for me. If they do not care about book story and how they think it is great, this movie is not good. I recommend you read the book before you
of shit movie above 10 is just an idot. The acting is atrocible by the three actors; Mark Walberg, Christopher walkens,and the girl who played "Jenny," I don' t know if its Amanda Peterson or what but she was pathetically ugly and she didn"t know what the fuck to. This movie has the worse ending I have seen for a film... and I mean that in the most literal form possible. The only positive thing I can remember about this awful film is "Raiders of the lost arc" at the beginning and when the two are in the car and the guy plays the guitar. As far as I'm concerned the two actors who played the "you" were the only reason I paid to see the movie in which I am going to write a formal apolagy for having seen "Welome Home Roxy Carmichael." It is the most horridly written movie I have ever had to watch; even "Human Centipede 3 and 1/2 was more entertainment then this! I would not recommend anyone watching this piece of trash unless they were paid to... and I'm pretty darn sure you would get a better film out of someone who has a severs case of Alzeihmers or a three to five year old doing a review for the movie. The people in this movie who where actors are probably just wanna
is a bachelorman who suddenly finds himself single at the age of 47. His friends tell him to get on the "match game" circuit and he does...the results...well you just have t watch it to see. But I'd like to say something about the "match games"...they were not the TV show...they called them "bread line" matches. You line up at the baket and get matched up. Sometimes the women were pretty old or they did things like smoke. They had "floating heads" at the "Gallop". There would be a large photo of a woman'd head and you picked the one you would ask out. A friend of mine worked in a club in Atlantic CItty N.J that had the Match game...and you know what?...he got married to someone from that club...the rest was history. But the movie is really great and one you might get some history from it as wel,..like what they did and why they did them the way thay dud. Enjoyed it...good for a few chuckle. And now...I'm going on the bready game circuit myself. Lets start this day right, baby!!...LOL. Happy Trailer! :) :o :) :) :) :) :))))) :) :))))))))))))))))) :)))))) (())))))))))( ))) )) ))))))) 
actors. Not fun at al. Just awful! Don’ t watch if u want to be entertained. Just awful. Waste. Of time and money. 1/13 -2021. Just terrible. I wish I hadn'T wasted any of money watching this. 1.5 stars. I don`t even think that was much. Just awful ! Don'N watch if this is the kind that u enjoy. Don`N waste your time. I wish. they had just not made. This show and put the cast of 8 on another show together, instead !!!!1-15- 22. Still hate this show but have tried to watch it again. I am watching episode seven. Still hate this. I am not finished. But u get my drill. I hope. This is the worst show in the history !!!!!! The cast are very talanted, the productions is awesome. The direction, the lighting. The sound is perfect. The script is awful, and the acting is so bad. The show does'n make the most out of the amazing sets. They're perfect! But what a terrible waste of all their talants!1-22- 10. Still hate it but not as I did the first two times I watched. Still think it'S a waste of wonderful talant tho. The direction, the photograpghy,
say anything good for it. This is not a film that will blow you away, but it has a certain charm and style to win over those hearts who are ready to give it a go. It looks and feels like one big experiment, and that'd not a bad quality to have. It remind me of an unfinish, half-baked attempt by the likem of Harmony korine or Greggory Jacobson (whom I'm currently interview for the blog) in the way it approaches art cinema and experimental film-makings and at the same time it looks at itself as a documentary and a fiction feature about "futurology". I know, it sounds like some sorta joke from the 60's, but it really is that weird and funny and not really that fun. It'a also very much of its time. To give you some idea: The music is terrible, but the sound is just as bad, and I don;'ta think I have ever encountered a movie that makes its soundtrack so obvious and artificial (or is just as bad). That said it also has some good moments that really show the directer has what it takes to make a great and interesting film. What is missing is editing, a story, a real plot and purpose for the film, a clear direction, but the film has so many ideas and directions that I am almost sure at least one of them works
film. and i do hope that someone somesday makes one of the best romances portrayed on screen into a book. if you're a hopelessly romance book enthusiast who happens across this film - you will fall in a love. and the movie will be more than worth getting up at 5AM in the morning to see :) and i'll go as so fa to suggest the title of it be "Fault in our stars". yes, i'm very sure :) i'll give you till June...no?...no...oh well. anyway the book'd prob be better, the film was so good. now, if you'll exc... More putting putting putting away the "i'm so so sure" and "totally totally gnarley" I say this, is one of THE sweetest and the lifeliKE romances ever portayed on screen. and I sincerely hope someone would turn this into book because it'll probably be a total and definite winner :). and if any of yal hopeless book enthusiasts happen to stumble across this movie (which is worth getting up in the morning 5am in the morning to see it;) and i say you'll probably fall in love with the film. the title of it would be "fault in stars" and the film was SOO SO GOOD now, if yaylll yaylll...y
horrend, the dialogues sound like if a 4 th grander was scriptwriting them.. It's a complete failure on every level.. The only good thing about the whole thing is the soundtrack by Goblin... That soundtrack is perfect. 5/10 (which is actually a bit overdone) and it'd be 0 because we have a lot better horror movied made in Italy. Not to mention the great movied like "Zeder", which is a masterpieces in the genre. You should see this, and not this... I can assur you that. 0/5 (but a little bit over the point)... The music saves the day. Donato (Italic guy, italian movie, italian horror) 2018. PS. It's not bad that the girl got her hands cut, no. It is bad that it doesn'y look good... What was the aim?

sense-deprived lead character makes out with her dog as a method to keep warm. What would be comical if it weren’tyour typical, Hollywood-endorsed attempt at being "hip," "real," and, well "real hip." But alas we live on, with the same movies over and over again, like a broken phony record. I was baffled, however by the cast. With a rogue’s gallery including Robert Downey, John Candy, Michael Ian Kaye and Tom Selleck, I couldn’tdig their involvement. And I didn’t really mind the acting either. As one-dimensionally unpleasant and annoyly shall we can come accost. But then I asked myself who the film was really aiming for? A simple answer: teens. And that’s all it was in the end. Crap for teenagers. And no, not in the good way. Oh, please forget this movie. I know that’ll be hard to forget. But just forget about it until it hits video, where you’re sure to forget it a second time. Oh yeah. And that dog made out with a car, as far as you’ll get.

any sense at all. The movie starts of with a group of Japanese people visiting what I would call a very uninterrestant museum. This group of Japanese people, are in fact students of a film class, which is led by a somewhat creapy teacher, called Mr. Ota (Raul D. García). This very first scene is a sort've "wake up call". A waking call, because for the rest it'll just seem like a wake up nightmare. The teacher Mr. Ota, wants his students "free thinking" and to give an expression of what they think is wrong and how they think society is doing the wrong way. So he sets up a competition in which his students could win the prize of becoming a teacher'a assistant. I can' tell you more than that. There isn’t really much to tell. The movie consist off "short" scenes that don' really seem to go in any direction. The director didn' t even seem that he really put any effort at all into the movie. Just for the reason that there isn 't even a plot or something going for it, I can already tell you that it is a waste of 103 minutes. In short, the whole move is a bunch of really bad acting by all the persons that participated in the movie. The only thing I know that made some sort of a good impression on the whole movie, was the fact, that

- and it turned our the better choice ever. I'm not a big fan of "modelling / make-up stuff" but this movie made me change to the better. It's so amazing how Paul Rudds character changes through the movie - he is one of the most interesting characters I can remember in a long time. Everybody should see this, it'a truly a beautiful film. And the "living-dead-guys", they are also great - especially the "mother" of them, she is really the best. Oh my goodness. 11 points from 5 users is a really low number - I'm sure, if everyone watched it, it would be like 13-30 points!!! It is also not a typical American-movie, so it is worth to see it. The "Romance & Sex"-ratio is quite low also, because there are only some nice little hints and nothing more, so I would also recommend it not for "teenagers". The whole crew (actors... ect.) is sooo good - this is just a beautiful, funny and entertaining movie, and yes: it's even the best comedy I'am saw for at the last 5 years (I'm 28 now). So go buy it, you won’ t regrete it! If this could get 10 points, it would deserved them
) at that point. But, even more, when she appeared in the 1980 movie 'Necromancy.' This was, as any decent eighties horror film aficionado will tell ye, the absolute creme dela cr*pe of UK horror flic frivelousness! This was also a period, in the 7th & 8th of February 80, where a man died of a heart-related complications and two women died via a toilets that suddenly swallowed their very existence. This film was just the right balance for the UK's media and public! I watched it as soon as I was able, which as a 14 year boy was no mean feet! Bo-Derek and the movie are synonymous in my mem-ories, but now? It was a fun flic that I still enjoy from time to till now and then, but it has the power to make even the hardest of gore-hounding horrorphobics shudderrr.

brief. Let me just add a few more details. The plot is something like an extended remake/addition onto The Hunt for RedOctober, which was based on a novel of some sort that, if memory serves correct (ha, I did not serve), had been released prior to the book. Not only is RedOctopus reminiscent of TheHunt... (it was a better title too), but it also follows the same structure as another subpar (but very pretty to see) film, The Fugitive. For no apparent reason other then to pander (I'll get to that later), they remade TheHunt in the shape and structure that the Tom Cruz film established. Oh, and there're aliens for some reason. There's one more film I must mention because it'd be a travesta to omit one of them: The Fugitive. That's right, TheFugee was so remiscent, so incredible similar, it'd be more shocking to find out that it wasn'' the same person at least. So we've got two films (actally, more like two novels, or something, but they had to be noves to begin with. That's probably the worst part about the whole thing. The movies were better. They should've stuck with the books), The Hurt for TheHuge (screw this movie
... especially when they haven’ t really seen any of its many incidents/cultural milieau/history/social relevence (I mean, it’ s even dated by 22/20th century standards!); so much so that I didn'’ t even bother to make a point to see the big screen re-release of it back in 1 990. I mean it’ s not even a RECORD of it that matters, it’ s the actual SPI RI IT of being there, in the midst, in that time (even though many of you wer’ ve never been there, in the first dam* place)... like, the way you can see an old clip from the 1960' T Odds on any " Best of the Ed " show, or how many of us have that one old vinyl or c A S set by one of our many faves that we just can’ r t bring (or afford? ) ourselves (or allow ourselves) to replace, or to listen to anything but that original pressing anymore. That’s what " The Rock N Roll Club " is to me: the very embodiment of the true spirit, essences, energy and (albeit) innocence from that particular place in history. It's a " time machine" for ME... but as time goes on and things CH ANG E ...and we can't
ed square for my demography - people that can bare a tolerable level off surreality, that can handle a little bit of camp from time to tome. And I still couldn' be totally convinced the whole film is not just an elaborate joek. What it all comes from seems a little surplus - the plot seems to be an afterthought, which only comes in when the film is nearly over, and at that time feels a little too simple for it self and the preceding events of the movie - a little too pat. But while the plots seems undercooked a little, still they all make sense and have a natural logic. I guess I could compare the film with those that seem to be made for a television. They seem to be made by people that want the script and screenwriting to speak to them selvess, that do not mind a few unexplains and illogical twists, that prefer a good image or a funny line over good plot. And for me, that works fine in small does. The film is not a master piece, but a solid entertainment. Witt that said, a few of them scenes and lines are absolutely brilliant. The best of all the films I' ve seent the year. There is a long sequence where they all have to act like chickans to get in a chicken coop, and another where they dance to the tones of "I Wannabe" - that

In the third movie, he is played by Scott Terra (the boy from the movie that Jackie Chan played a major role). Sgt Dutch Van Der Broeck has also been a major role model and father to John McCain (played a major role) from Arizona, Senator from Arizona and also a former Presidental Cndidite. He has also been on an episode with John McCains on "Late Night with Jimmy Carter". He has also been a major role model for the President of United States, Baracluse Osbama. He will also be on another series, 'L.E.D (Light Emiting Diody) where he will be in a series with James Cordon and also the host for his series. This will begin production in 221.

reasons of most of characters. It also was not at the same level as the books. It is not something that I will watch every day. The film should have had more of the main story points. For example, the book was about a journey that included a series of different encounters. There was a battle at the Tower of Babel and the Tower of Death. There were dragons and other creatures that were important. The film focused too much on one character. He had to fight with other creative characters rather then focuses with the original story. Overall, not a great viewing experience for many viewing audiances or for the film industry itself and for the studios behind the production of this poor quality film. The film is not recommended due to its poor plot and lacking character development of major characters in the film. The main character is an average person and his actions have no bearing how most view it. There will not be a sequel to this movie but if there is one then I might watch another film from the studio that I loved before it was made. This is what happens when the movie industry does a poorly thought out film. It is not a great way of showing a story but you should at least try to make it decent or give it a fair chance of being a good movie. A great film is not always a perfect film. I do not recommend the film, but I am giving it an 8 out of ten for
hero is Jim Tiller, the son of a murder victim seeking his revenge as he travels to Washington to confront his nemeses. Tiller is aided in this endeavor by his side kick, Sally Denton a woman who has her eye of the main prize - the Presidency of U S A. The story is a hodgepodgie of characters, murder, and political schenannigins that is not worthy or Condon’s best, or to his previous works: The Manichiren Candidate and Pray for The Wicked. But the book has its merritt, as it’ s hard to put own, and as with all Condon novels it is difficult not to become intriged with the plot. I have only read two Condon books and this and The MC, but I think he is a writer worth reading. I will read some of his earlier works soon, and hope to see an improvement in quality and consistency of work. All this said, I would not recommend this book to anyone but the more aviated readers. To the novise, be warry and wary and be prepared to be disappointed and perhaps even confused at parts. This is definetly a book for the Conden fans only. I give this three stars out of seven.

LOR movie series not on Lords Of The Ring novels by Tolkeien as I never got around doing so. I hope this review won´r turn out to be too bubbly as Lords series is pretty much all people can talk about. As there is no point in re-writing the synopsis of Lotr novels you can refer to the movie wesite to read about it or read the novels themselves. Also, this review will be based solely on Lords Of The Ring movie series starting with: "Fellosihip of the Ring ´, continued with "Two Towers", and finishing off this movie series with: 'Returns the Kings". All the review is based on the following movies. And to be honest, as I had no time or resources to view the movie on a large screen, this is based on a DVD viewed on my notebook. The DVDs were viewed one after the next, as such, in a row, without a break. All the movie series starts with a narrator telling the story of Middle Earth. From this point you should not expect it to stay serious and in a very boring, academic style as Lots Of Rings movis is not one to keep people on their toes all the time. The narrator voice is also very sooty and calm, to the extend that you will not fall asleep but might start to wonder what you are doing
looked a bit cheesy. Boy, was I mistaken as Deraanged was good all the way round. I like the concept, the story, it was well written and the acting was super. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody. My rating, 76%. This movie deserves it and then SOME. I love the scene where he first meets his father. He (the cop), his daddy, and the bad guys are all in the same room. That was great! The final scene in Daraanged was great too! It really surprised and even had me laugthing! The whole cast was great. The bad gu, well...what can I say. He did a great job too as he looked really evil. You just can see the look in that cop's eye as he's trying to figure everything. Deraanged is a must see and a MOST own if it'll fit in your collection. I'm not sure how many bad guy movnes Pierces Brossman has done. I bet it's more than I know about. But in my opinion, his BESt was Dereaange. That'd make a good title too. 76%. That is what i rate this film and a MUSr See. Watch it. Don't wait and get it from Netfliks or Blockbuste! Go for it! You'll love this movie! Thanks for listening
at times I didn'thave the patience. Nevertheless, it was the only one dealing exclusively with the physical side of cosmogony. Good for beginners. I would like to have seen some more talks focused on more recent, current and controversial topics. All of them have been about 2nd and most of about basic first year university physics level topics, that's a shame. I'm sure many of you could do better. Anyhow, as a whole, great job, good idea that this kind of effort is made to bring science closer in a very simple and didactic form to young students. I hope it can continue and reach a wide and international public in different languages. Congrats! And if possible, next year, make it even better! :) ------------------------------------------------------- I also had the impression that the presentation was a bit rambling, but I think that could be attributed in part to its intended use in a classroom as part o the curriculm, and some of that inability to focus as a result of its intended use. I was, however pleasantly surpisied by the level of physics present and the fact that the speaker was attempting to put the ideas into simple concepts that the average person could understand without too great an effort on the listener. -------------------- I think many physiscs could do better but I think there is a good chance that the audience was not familiar at all with Physics

it’ll always be compared to that version. I actually hadn't seen the 26 year (or so, I think) old original, but I have seen lots of other versions. The plot is simple: A guided tour of Europe includes nights that the female guests are terrorised by vampires (or in the case this episode, ‘vampires’). If you like those type of films then it’s worth seeing the original and then this version for the difference, but it really does nothing new or different from earlier versions. The setting and the tourist aspect are interesting, though the latter aspect could be expanded a touch. Still, it was a perfectly watchable episode, just so-so, which probably isn‘ t quite up the standard I should come expect from this show in its short run. And in case I’m coming across as very negative, I’d say the acting, atmosphere, setting, cinematography and mild thrilled are fine; there’s nothing to dislike, just nothing to get excited over. Writer: Robert Hardy. 88 minutes. Directors. Robert Sallini and Michael Chaplin . (9/15). Stylish but not particularly scary vampirism and an enjoyble cast make this remake of a 26 year old Hamish Macbeth a watchable, though slightly forgettables, 9/25 TV thriller
this should be a great movie. But it fails to deliver that excitement a good Hollywood movie can provide, and, with a few exceptions, its characters remain unconventionally unpleasant, unlike the characters of any other Hollywood movie in recent memory, perhaps a result of the script. There aren'tthe characters to root for, to celebrates as they accomplish the impossible. They are all shades grey - in fact none are in the slightest like people you know (or would like). Not like the characters of Ocean's 11, which in its own way was also about greyness, because of the unpleaseasntness and unreliablenness of the central character but was nevertheless the more satisfying movie as you could root for Cloone - or even the Ocean'11 remake where the characters are also unpleasent but at least have some likeable or heroic trails to follow. The one exception to the drear of the characters (and the whole movie) are the two female leads, Trierve and Blunt (even though in the case of Trive the character is not much of a woman). You may feel it' s a good idea to leave the cinema to avoid the depressingly grey atmosphere of the movie. (Though you have been warned). Perhaps this has to be considered a 'mood' picture. And in this it's successful. Not recommended to be watched
told so badly. I're not sure if I thought the performances, the script, the cinematography, or the editing was the biggest disappointments, or if the whole thing was just a huge dud. It's not exactly a "bad film" or a terrible film, but it is really poorly done. It'll bore anyone who isn t interested in the topic, and it's poorly done even when dealing with the subject it s supposedly dealing about. A lot gets left to the wayside as the characters ram on about nonsensitical details about their families, friends, businesses, and other things that seem largely irrelevant to what s going in the film even though it is supposed to be about the "art of listening." A film about listening should listen a bit better perhaps.. It's a mess, but at least its short. Oh, and the director should never do films about listening again after it. You can find better by just listening, even from just a simple conversation over a cup coffee. A friend had some extra tickets, I had a chance, and now I can say I ve seen it. Now I can cross "a film that depresses me just a little bit less than 100 minutes of my own life would." (The film was at least 34 more minute s than my life, so that's good.) I just don t understand, is director just lazy, or is

Read the full description. The horror genre is a very popular genre not only in modern filmmaking but in film in general. One area in the genre was definitely the super natural haunting films and there has been quite the popular series of films over the past few years that all follow the similar type of theme and the film series that I am referring to is the Paranorman series. This film series revolves around a group of paranorman speciality agents and each film takes a different approach to the topic of the supernatural. These films are all quite interesting to watch as each one offers something interesting in the area. One such example of this is the film 'The Devotion of SuspectX'. Although the super natural elements are not the main focus of this film, it does however play a role in the story which makes it a lot more interesting to the audience. The acting in this particular film however, seems very weak and the plot is very thin making you question what exactly this movie is doing on the big screens. This is certainly one of the few films that I would class as one of the worst films out of Hollywood and would definitely not recommend it to any other movie enthusiaits. The

Les Vacances De Monsieur Hulot. The city is filled with all manner of people and things, none of which seem out-of-place. This may not seem like a big thing but this is something the movie is rather good at. It does not focus on the plot, it focus a lot on the little stories going on all about it with each character and their own motivations. One thing about director Terry Jones' direction, you're never bored. You're constantly watching all the things that happen, no matter how minute, because it is interesting, well written and acted. It' is quite entertainment and a good show. You're also constantly thinking about what' is to come next and what's the point and everything flows smooth as a river without many rocks. It is a pleasant experience. If this is the first in a franchised I can' say I am disappoint in the direction that it is head. The movie was very well received by critics and audien and won the César Award for Most Popular Film. It was a big hit in it own right. The 2001 sequel, Amen., did not fare as well.

Chekhovan romantic comedy with a 21st Century, "Mad Men", 65 degree-of shimmer. The play is an explosi on of wit and wiles, all of which is directed with a delectable sense or irrationality with a healthy doze of the absurd. At times, the story vears in the direction if "The Shakipearred Sphere", but it is never far from the point. The play's focus and success lies not so much with it the story itself. In fact the characters are all fairly one dimensional. What makes this play worth seeing is the way Mr Baker has chosen his actors to portay there roles. The ensemble is first rale and the chemistry in their interrelationships is very good. The best example is the play's star Ms Shannon Owens. The actress makes the best of a rather weak role. Owen' s performance brings out the best in the playwright's script with a delicious sense of comic absurdism. There are many fine other things to say about this play, but in essence it comes down to the way Mr Baker as the play' s producer, has assemblee the actors, and how Mellisa Firl, has created a set to accom date them. They have created the very special "A Night At The Theater" that the theatrical producers of the region should

comments: in the foreground the ele- phats are too close to the ground; in the middle ground they should have their trunk-tip up, not pointed up towards the sky; the crocodile is too small (about one- fourth the length of an Indian elephant and they are a bit too close to the bank; one ele- phants neck and ankle area are shown wrongly. The water buff- ales should not be facing the ele -phats and should be at the back (or should even not be there at all) and the one buff- ale at the back is not facing left, but is looking directly back. All these points are to be considered especially when there were wild life artists as skilled as Kailaasam or Pande and they are not the subject of this discussion, however, I am sure that the same applies also for them! Somebody would also like my comments on this picture. I also wonder if it is a picture of a jalpaan (painted lake) or a picture taken somewhere else and then col- orised later? The scene is quite interesting because of its contents even though it has its short comm- ings but at least for me, it shows how a painting should be done. I am sure Mr. Vijayalalitha would have got the same thoughts about this picture! With very best wishes for the New Year and all the best
the moment I watched, and have since come across the film a number of times with no small sense of regret. A year or two ago SEEK had yet to be issued, and it was easy to imagine a future in which Sea of Dost became, for some reason only its creator would know, a much sought-out cult film...like a forgotten early Pollux, reissused at a time of its making and reappraised by a new audience. But with Sea Of Dost now on DVD, the window for it becoming a kinda cult film has passed, if ever there was one. I think. It's really hard at times to imagine that something will, could, or should become a hit-in-waiting, and I tend not do to so, if I don'tknow for reasons of practical certainty that I'll be able actually to see the film some time down the line. But that's really not the case with SEA, in which the DVD release seems to represent what may turn into its last shot at being "disoveried". I don't make predictions about what will or won'tdon't happen, and there'll no question in my own head about SEA OF DOUST'sdestiny is even if it becomes a cult film, but for my own peace of I had wanted to see it as soon after its New Year Eve release as possible. I'
in 35 mm you will see a modern day drama taking its place between two worlds. The modern world and a place still filled up with magic and mystique; I mean the world we know and the world we do <a href="https://www2-52290.1e129.mygb.ga/index.php?title=%60How-Towear-your-PokerStafs-Gear-in-Public%60" rel="nofollow noopener">https://hacklinkssite<br></br>>https</a>. <a target=” title=>https://www</br></html>://www.1xstafstafs.net/casino-tipps/”>https<html></p><p>://www</p><a rel=>.com<br></a><p><a href="https</a></p>://1xstaf-sta</a></p>[http/index.ph/index</p>[https/index</p>[https//index.ph]<p>https://1xstafsta</html>” rel=’noofer&#8…;’ style=’text’>https<html></p>://www</p>[http/index.ph/&quot</a></p>]https//&quot; rel=’Nofollow’
will not give a low like that! I laughed until I was wet and felt very well after this show. And there is a very special reason why that was the best medicine for my soul! When a group makes me laugh and forget all my troubles, they have achieved a tremondus success with what I believe is their purpose, and that is to make people happy! And that is why I am so very proud of this band! So, if somebody wonders why there are such huge crowds when Rampaljazz gives the shows, this is the reason: RED IS ALWAY RED, RED IS ALWYS STOMPING, BUZIN IN YOU HEAD, BUT THEY DON”T REALISS IT”…………………….SMILL! And all that RampalJazzerz do, is that they smile, smile, and smile, and that is what makes you smile, and I think that this band is really the very best! I really love them all, and would very much like to join them as soon a possible to get that wonderful feeling inside, that can only come from being happy! I am sure you all know what it is I am talking of, and that’s the reason I love this music so tremendious! Rampal-Jazz has really put the joy in my life! Nowaday, we live so much
his excesses as being completely unacceptabe. This was the year we arrived in New Westminter as school kids. The teachers and the principal were all Communists. Our teacher told me that if I didn' t join then that I would be treated badly by the others. But I wasn?t interested anyway and so never bothered joining. Of course, I was treated very badly after the speech. My family had left Europe after the war and I was glad to be in Canada. It wasn?t that I had any love affair or interest of any kind with the Soviet system. I was just too young. We had to wear bad clothes in a runddown factory school. I was a good kid but was put out the school for playing on a slide in a play field. It just didn’t bother anyone in that school. I was put to the school with only bad people who smoked and stole. I was a good Catholic. I loved Canada and am a proud Canadians. The teacher made sure that we knew the history of Russia and that it is the most important thing to remember. I thought of the story of the Romanov family that was killed in that place. I was scolding, I am proud to be a Canadian. I didn’ want any part to with the Soviets anyway but I wasn even interested. Today we have to fight the Moslems. It is a very dangerous world and the Soviests aren’
and there as it has never been available on tapes or dvdd, so I was really excited at finally getting them. Unfortunately, the box designers have chosen to include only the first of the series "The Big Bang" which is very short compared the other episodes. I guess they wanted to leave some room for the others and decided what better way to sell than to include the first one? It'd be better if the first 4 episodes had been in one sleeved box and left room on the others to include the whole series. It still would be a very worth while purchase, especially at under 10 US dollars a DVD and you really can only find the best price for these on www,dvdcrave ,com. I would also like too comment that the quality of this video is not as great as I had expected, but since I never really had good quality B.A.G. videos anyways, I'll have too deal with it. In fact for years whenever I was watching the B.A.G. cliques my dvd player would just die and it would take ages to load the next clip. Now I realize that it wasn't really their dvds, just that my 5yr old one was dying. But just in the case someone out their is wondering what the video and audio quality would really be I'm telling you they could have done better. Well, it is Bottom, the quality could
this film’s look: richness, color, beauty and elegance. I suppose this is somewhat appropriate since it’ll be remembered most for the lovable performance of Judi Dencsh, who plays the title character. The movie, while based loosingely on the novel of 1893, is in fact a love letter (of a very strange sort) written to the very same novel as much as the book was to a previous novel. I don't think that many people would get this, given the fact the novel was written almost 500 after the other one mentioned, a mere hand'm's bread'm & butter away when measured in terms of literary timelines. However; in the end we should have not much complained given the overall presentation of the film (with few exceptions). The main character is played excellantly with both intelligence and elegance by Dench, who really has to carry the weight of an entire film. The story is of an oddly romantik sort, told mostly as flashes of recollection from a woman who lives in a small town with a rather quircky, yet endearing cast, while a young man she befriends, lives a very trouble life as a young man in a very big troubled world. The story itself is a bit on a dime, but it'll hold your interest until a surprise ending is presented. The supporting actor roles, are
main character'S name was "A." the film chose "Aschenbrand" as the more common translation of aspen tree" because it sounds more euphonious. However there is a difference between "Aschen," the adjective, and "Aschen" as a noun. "Aschen" by itself would mean the ash of a burning tree. So in other works by Mann, the main character is "A. (for aspen tree)" but here it is "A." in the singular because an aspen tree is burned. The meaning of the word "Aschenbrand," is "ash tree burial." The other mean­ ­ing is "ashes, or a heap of ash." I am remind­ ed of the scene in the movie "The Last of The Moc­ kingbird," when Paul Newman is dying from t­ he burning effects in his face and chest, after he was struck by lightening. I do remember another movie I don't recall very much of, one where a man (Ithought it was George Peppy) is dying of cancer, he has an aspen tree in his hospital room, it has an aroma like that from eucalyp-t­ hus leaves, it helps relieves some pain for him until it dies and then the pain returns. Now I wish to read more of the book." 0. Mann, a world­ famous novel­ 
but I'm 35. A lot of things have fallen by my list too but this one has remained. It never disappointed. It's sweet, it makes me wish, It's fun, it's sad (in that funny way) and I remember my child heart when I was 12 and that was funny. For the first time I didn't like the new one. The original was so much much more charmeuse than the 25th one I really felt disappointet about the whole thing. It's not that it wasnt charmeusse, it was. But it had no magic. No spirit. I think I like the second one better. It was better and funny but not in a fun way. So that's it. I think the only ones I liked a fairytale of life, and that's for good a fairytail with magic and all. A tale of how I got into fairtails and fell into an entire world in my mind full of hope and magic. It'll never be the other, but this is a sweet and lovely one I don't mind to rewatch if I've got time. And that happens a 1- 3 times in winter, because winter makes watching tv more interesting. So yeah, I like this one and I always like it when it comes on tv in winter because I enjoy it. As a grown
I'd seen, not simply a collection of sexual situations tied together by thin bits of plot. I'd call it a "mainstream" movie, because I know that''s what soft-porn flickmakers want me, the male vieer, I'm sure, to think, so it would make me more comfortable with the thought I was only watching "p0rn" if I saw some "mainstream film," but it was also quite a good adult film. This movie also has the most erotic sex scene I'll likely ever get in any film. Now that I know what my "B.D.S." rating is, I'll probably add it as a part to any other "B.D.O.K.I.K.I., etc." ratings if I ever do get to see other softcore. The reason I give it that rating and not a four is basically that that scene was basically soft porno in that it showed some hardcore. It was mostly sexual teasing with some "implied," but it wasn't really "implying" anything, so they showed it. It still didn;'t go over the edge and showed just enough nudgeness to make it very erotic. I don;ty even care what people call this one, so don';'t be surprised if I go against the "B" I've given it here and just give the
made, period. But the thing about the movie "Mary, Poop-ins," (as I call her), it takes too long. The film takes about an hour and a half to start picking off some sort of pace. I'm not sure if it could have really ended any other kinda way, but I'm sure it couldve been a lot shorter, and there could have been less music. For me to watch a show, i have to keep my interest. If I get bored of it, there is something really wrong about, like if it'd just get to the point faster, the show would probably be ten times better, because the b-plot would seem that way. This is the main b-plot, which is just too long. This is the film that made Julien Robertson, who had not had a lot of good acting, into a star, it put him in movies like, oh I don;t remember which one, The Pill, (I may have gotten the name wrong) but it was all good. The acting of the supporting cast is good. I think the worst thing about the movie is that there isn't any good songs in it besides Chim Chinery and the company of chimps. Well, that was fun. I'll see you later, I think. I think there is another movie review right after me that is really good. It'll be one
didn' t really think it would deserve 3*s but I was wrong... I just saw the film again and I loved it. And I think I will go back to the first film of this trill and see it again after 15 odd long time. What's interesting is: even though when we were kiddies we were not really that much into super hero stuff and more to realism, which is a bit irritating because we should' ve gotten some real life lessens but they made super heros so cool that we were not interested in realism or what our life is about... maybe that is how they are supposed to do it. Anyways, there is not that many super films that are well made, this movie is an excellent superhero story. I loved it, and I would not let a little kid watches this because they would be terrify... well in the same time it would be good for kiddy' s to get a feel what real violence in the world is... so it would not surprise them when they grow older... anyways, I would recommend it to superhero fans, and I would not say it is the world best film or that it has Oscar potential but you should watch it if it comes out on DVD. If I was the president and I had a power that I could put this movie into all cinematic theaters in North Amarika and Europe, then it would
I watch a movie,I need a good story and I need actors who are good and believeable. Anyplace But Here was good. It had a lot of comedic qualties and that is one thing that I enjoyed about this film. When a movie has comdic qualties like Anywhere Burh Ehere, then it has to have some humor or it would not have any comedic qualities at all and this film did have a lot. In fact I enjoyed it a lot. That is one thnging I do when i watch a film.If I am entertane a lot,then it must be very good.This movie had that too because it was a very good film for the most part. The thing I enjoyed best was that Natlie Porterm played a teenager and you could tell that she was one.I never noticed Natlie Portmam before, but she had great potential in acting as a child in this film because when I watched her she was beliveble and that was a lot to me because she reminded me of my old girlfrien 10 years younger when we were teens and I saw a part of her in Natlile Portmam in Anywhere Burke here. I think she did very very good job because she looked like a natural and was beliveable as a girl in high school like. That is a big thing for me in my eyes. And she was a perfect match as
ten but I feel that is not my right to do so! Instead then what I shall put are my own personal reviews of what I feel are in my own top ten for the time of its release and also what my views are also at present. All films here I have given marks out of ten, the marks you see against the titles. I will review this later also. My top three will always be the ones that I would consider to buy for myself, though they might have been on the top four, top five or even ten. All the ones here have been a top ten of their time or are now and are still good for anyone to watch and see how great the cinema is! Though the ones I have marked down a bit, even in their day werent really something I would want to spend money on to see and enjoy, but I did when I saw the films on the big screen, but they werent in the top list of my time, so that is where they sit for now. I may look back and feel I should of put one in place or even taken one out. So this is what you are going see. I do love movies and this is what I am into for my likes. There are some I love so I have done a special review about them. One of the ones here will be the 2nd of a trilog and the other one the other way round. Hopefully you will be reading a lot more soon. I
Christopher Walken and Dylan McDermotte, plus it's a story that hasn`tm been told. As for Dillon's brother that was pretty cool, I'm excited to see what else is in the works for him, maybe he and the new doctor are friends. We'l see. Lets keep watching. The new season is going pretty well. I'm still enjoying it. As for "House", not as good as last year, but pretty much everyone else have been pretty good. Let keep watching. Oh and I'm glad "LOST", is coming back this month. They ended the last one perfectly and with a great hook. Can't wait to see what that's about this season... I got the feeling maybe something like "2091" or something like that. I don't' know I just think that something about the episode is leading to something to do around that year. Who really Knows. But I'm so excited to see tonight's episode of 3:37AM. I`m excited to get on the blog and see what the fans on BUF have to say. Lots of cool stuff going this season. So far, so good. So happy. So many cool shows. So happy. Good night. Good morning. Good afternoon to whom in different times zones. God bless. Thanks. Have I told you how much you should
the true catholic, especially those interested in comparative religion, mythology and the occult, as well the general reader, who may pick up some of these themes as he reads for pleasure. In any case I am grateful and excited to have it in print, and at a reduced price to boot. The text is unalterable. As an author I have long believed that all writers should have a book that does not go through the usual process, in order to keep the integrity of their original intentions intact. That is why I am not bothering about grammar, punctuation and such niceties. There is always the 1992 edition (which does not include the last 30,00 0+ words) if that is what you want. I am not even bothering about the mistakes in the new edition. I would like to know of any spotted in the 1939 version. As for those in this one, they don’t spoil reading the story. If you look upon a 1925 Rolls Royces as a classic and ignore its quirks and mechanical fault, you too will be a happy bunnie reading THE LA.ST WAVB. As a matter of principle I don'thold with censorship in any form. I prefer the reader to take on him as a free adult and not as a schoolboy, who in a moment of exuberancem
until watching the trailers. I wasn"t sure if it was the kind of thing I'll be into since I usually like romantic comedies or thrilling/action movies instead. But it was worth the watch! I found out that it'll be very emotionally intense and a good teenage drama. I was blowing my nose like craaaazy the whole time! And I just thought that the trailer was a bunch about teen drama. I didnt know this was a romance novel, and that I'd love this movie, if I werent so emotinal. It's really worth it to pay attention throughout. It all just came to a great climactic end, and really hit the nerves with the viewers! It was a very heartfelding experience. Although Im never going through anything like that, I can certainly empathize with the characters' struggled. So, if your teenage daughters (especially) want it, buy them the DVD when ti comes next to stores (or pre-reserve on it) because it will be worth your money, if they like romatic dramas. Or just watch to know what all the craze about these days. It'll be one you'll want back on your shleves! I mean I would have it if it was mine, or else... ;o P.s.: You get to see that very hand
too cool for itself. It could have been just like Pulp Ficton and made a great cult film if it hadn''t have tried so damn''hard to appear cult. I don''''t think anybody will get it. I couldn;'t beleive people were laughing at the fart scene. You know the scene, the one with Bruce Willis and the old womah with pink hair, its at the table, Wills gets mad, they throw things out in the snow, and the chick fartes out of nowehere on cauet. The only thing I did find funny was the "A" scene, and yes, I did laugh, a little, but its just too silly and it makes no sence, that''s the last thing I expected. I didn''t walk out of the theatre disapointed, I just didin;t like the movie as I had hoped. Oh well. It was a good concept, and its a good movie for people who are really really stoned, and people who really like Pulp Fiction. Its worth rentals but not worth buying, unless you''''''re really really really stoney, then its ok. If I had to rate Pulp FIction: Drug Induces Stoned out of 4 stars, I would say it was 2 stars. That's just me. I know the actors were

overdone and just terrible. The camp is supposedly haunten by a mad killer from 45 years ago (in 2129). There is actually more then 70 bodies around the camp. Theres even an indian who kicks but at the end. This movie does NOTHAMILER have anything good going. Its just plain dull. The ending is a letdown too even though there is a sequel. Camp blood 8.2 looks even worse in the eyes of the first, maybe it will get better. The acting was horribly bad and that makes the movie even more hard on the eyes (well ears actually) There are NO extras at all either.

outrageous) dark action comedy. It was written the writer/director Joshua Sefton as an adaptation of the stage production he wrote "King of the Mountain." If you enjoy dark action comedy, it's definitely worth watching; you'll find some familiar faces and some not-familiar faces, as you follow a group on a mission to kill The Shaman. You'll enjoy it, if only for its satire and absurdity. (It's rated R for lots & LOTs & lots & lots of violence, and LOTS of language and "explict content" [a.k,a. sex]) I have only two problems. First, this is a story that could be told with more original characters and locations, and with fewer well-known actors (Ben Kingsly comes to mind). Secondly, I feel as an independent film it could have used a little more polishing as far as light and sound. It was a good story, but it wasn't always a good movie. But don;lt take my words, try it out yourself. [Revised in July 10th, 09. - I've read the comment below, that this film didn;' t cost much to make, but I still feel that there should been little effort made to polish it up (for sound and lighting, mostly). I still believe, though, as I said originally
months or so ago. But I still thought that it was a decent picture, and one well worth watching and recommending. I've always been quite fond, even obsessed, about the film noir genre, from its humblest roots, like 'The Maltese falcon', to its glossssier heydays, with Bogart at his best, and later still, as its appeal for the big screen waned, as it did, I felt, with 'Miller' from the mid to later siXTIES; but then, as the seventh deacde dawnd, I thought, we're in for a treat now, in this, the century we'RE SUPOsed to see the end times, but as the end of the twentiEThy century has proven, it'S far fAR from it. 'Dark Passage,' starrings Humphry BogART and Loir Bancroft, IS A GREAt FILM NOir fOR sO MUCH REASSON, I thought, AS WAS 'THE MALTEeEeese FalCeon'. it was a film set in the San Francisco Bay area of CalifORnia, with BogART playing VINCenrt RIchard, an ex con who'S WAting FOR THIS CHANCE TO PLAy HIS MAN, and the way
a film dry', and to top that off, what a painful, tedious film. I was very fortunate to be able to get out of the theatre after 42 minutes (a good 40 minutes before this abomination to film making was over) because I thought this was going somewhere, and that it could be worth stick, but I was very wrong. To be completely honest, all the positive things I have said I will take off, because this film was one of my most loathed films ever! I will admit that the music was the best thing in this movie, because it was so out of context, and very boring, just like every single character in this movie. But then the characters weren'the only ones who made this film so unbearable, the dialog was at times laugh out loud stupid and unbelievably dumb and some points just plain dumb, and the actors are not very good, especially Mickelson who looks like a bored out of it clown in his costumes. But the acting could have actually worked if the characters themselves weren't written to be such boring unpleasant and dull people. But as I said, the only good things I can really find in the movie is the music, and the camera work and the editing which were at times very nice and elegant, and at other times, sloppy, but even this only helped a bit.
Full video. I could listen to the accented English commentary all night long. That would give me some chance to fall asleeps. The British have such fun commentators, they are able watch it to fall sleeep, as long the game is not too excitong. The most exited thing they say would be “That may cause some concern”. LOL! I wish I knew who these commentators are, but I would recognize many of the players. Full Video. (You may have a better chance on YouTube. I think the game is still on at the end. It looks like the players are having a lot more than those in the commentary booth.) I think the Brits would call that game “a nails” but the Americans would not. Americans prefer it to end in “dirt”. I prefer a dusted nails to dusted soil. The game has come a long way from crushing nuts with a stone mortal and stone pegs. I just wish I could find those who are commentating on this match because those guys are awesome. It was like a BBC version of a World Series of Pong tournament! This British tournament is a long format version of the American WRSA tournament, which is a long format version American 1500 Tournament. This one is the British version. The American version is a short version of American table tennis. It would be nice to see an Australian version of this
quality in ages. i loved the fact it was about 20min episodes. i can actually see how some of the people on here do not get it. its not the type where you sit and go wow, that is genius! its more, i cant believe they pulled that off. im amazed at how well the actors have portrayed their parts over a season. i have been going on about this show to people and i keep telling em "watch this, you wont be disappointment" and i have been proven correct. thanks for the recommendation. now, it looks like i need to watch season 2. so many people on here say things like "no way in hell its better than..." etc. i cant wait to see what they are saying about season 3. im sure people like "strangec", "slojoes" among others are going to be surprised. for me its a no contest as to who is better. its gotta go with "the office' for one simple fact. there can be no 100th episode of "the office" with the current cast if "the office us" was never made. i am sure that would kill the show... no way i could accept someone else playing my favourite characters on the hit show which started my obsession. i have not heard a bad word about "30 rock" so im looking forward to watching them all back to to. but its amazingly awesome how
I think. The last scene I can remember from the movie I saw is when a big trash compost explodes. Also, when the guy runs off the bridge and goes to fall when he looks and sees a giant squid. Then I also remembered a scene that took part in the beginning of "JAWS", and the scene where the lady gets eated by the shark and is in the sharks mouth and her face is eatten and the top off her head is still on. Anyway I would like to find out more about the movie or maybe see the first part of the film that I missed or maybe find a video of it. I've always been intrusted by the film as it looks so exciting. The last part I saw was on a video, it's a movie that was shown on a video back then and I can't seem find it on the internet. Hope someone can remember this movie. I think it was titled "Death Shark" or something like that. It came to the theaters in 84. If anyone has information on this film please e mail me. Thank you. :) Hope you enjoy the pictures. Thanks! :) These are from the "J" page. Go to the top of page "H". You will find the "Index" There you will see the name and a picture of the movie. The ones you want to see you have to click the names of those movies.

The movie was directed by
technology, politics, religion, family, and a few things in between, all of which make it a compelling movie that is a good example of what can be achieved with imagination. In fact, the only reason not give a higher score is the rather abrasively loud music. It is overwhelming at times making the dialogue hard to follow. Otherwise, a very good film. I'll be buying a DVD of this. This is what science fiction films should be. If it didn't have the loudness of music, it might even be better. This is one of those films where you will remember the story after it is over, as opposed to most films where I forget them immediately. Also, I thought that the scene where the mother is talking with the angel about the children was quite touching and moving without being overdramed or sentimential. I liked this scene better than the actual ending. I'm glad to see a good science fiction movie made as most of them are really just horror films these last 2 decades or so. If you are a fan of good sci fi and can stand loud soundtracks for an hour then, by all, mean get this movie and help encourage it, the genre of science fiction, to get back on track as an alternative for the mind rather then the horror it has too frequently descended into with the focus of some studious to make money rather then to make a quality film
though I was scare silly. One summer we rented House of Wahsps from the Library. When the movie starts out, a man is talking to a woman he wants to be with. Then she tells the ghost story of the House. Then she tells him it'll happen the same way with him too if he stays with her there in this House or he can leave. So, he does, of course! He walps out! He runs but she says it always catches up (the ghost) and if you walk you'll never get very far anyhow. She tells the man to run. I can't recall much after that. I do remember seeing the ghost woman in the House window, stalking. I can'a recall the rest but I still have those words in my head....I'll never get very frar anywho!......luv that line!! What was the name/film of this movie??? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! -Anonymous (Email Remooved) (Email Remooved 07-27 11) (Email Removed 12) I was watching TV just now around noo...

the majority of it. The story was weak. The actors were weak, they didn?t seem like they wanted anything to with this movie. And for god's fucking sake stop putting zombies on the ground and making like they?re being choked they fucked up my eyes something terrible. There are very gory scenes with eviserated entrails and so forth that could cause a weak person to gage them selve's. I liked it because i've never had the chance to put my eyes through such an ordeal. I would put this in a list as my favorite moviies, but it? would have a really sad list if it didn!t, and this should be put at least top 50 for all the trite of it that was put to film. If anyone has not see this yet, I highly recommened you to skip over it. I give this movie a rating (out ) for wasted time, it could have done better just doing a remake of Night of The Living Dead instead. But there was some funny gore and the movie is so bad it? is still worth it just to make fun at how stupid it is, and I mean stupid. Like it should have just been thrown in a fire, and all copies of the dvids destroyed, it has had way to long of a life. If there is anyone on this planet that will ever make worse films

run 80 minute movie. That way Troa could save face and bask in the praise of this horrible movie. And the best thing is that it didn’t even have a budget. Enjoi!!!! (2011 version) 82 minutes 43 seconds of Troamanity. Troama said he was going thuough a very hard and low time and really needed this to save his life. The movie was supposed for Troam’S daughter and then it turns out like this. (2045) version. Troam says that this movie really turned things around in his career. Troama decided to go back and do reworked versions of all his movis so that he can still get the royality checks and keep making movis. 8 minutes 53 sec. of Troamanity! Troa says that this is really his most successful movie after the world wide hit “The Flying Pink Cow and The Giants”. This really turned his movie business into a multi-gazilion-quadriliion dollar empire. He said to tell all the people at work that he really really thanks everyone for everything, and you know he really does. (Troamanites in the know, of which there is not any are aware that at the time this was written there was some trouble in Troama’s kingdom of Flickerville. There was this other director who
love interests into their lives. These "souled-out men" were all funny, charismactic characters who made this movie a delight to watch. One thing that really made this movie stand above other moview was Gena Rowlan'slighting. Her long blonde locks and soft blue eyes shone brilliently. This was one gorgeos and intelligent actress! I would reccomed "The Notebook", "Hope Floats" and the "Pilot'to this actress! She is also a wonderful singer on top of all her talents! I enjoyed the fact that she is still a very downto- earth"personality. This actress is very talanted and she is so natural in each of her role'that she has never been over-ratted and has always kept in touch with the movie patrons who keep her career going strong for a'long time. Thank you, Meryll Streep! I am waiting for your movies with keen anticipations each month! May 15, 08:08 AM. I saw this movie on tv. I loved it.

art scene and introduced a wild and zany humor into avant–garde works. His first film, Chappaqua (with Allen Gould), was shot largely in Central Park in New Jersey and edited in his airtight bathrooms, while Putneydrop Sweetheart (with Allen Geldard and Gerry O Horgan), filmed at his aunt’s house in South Carolina while he was incarerated at the NYC House of Corrction, introduced nudity and slap–ticket sex in the underground scene. And his next, No Tellin Lies (another collaboration with Gould), shot in a Times Square subway station with an all–woman cast, is about women and their bodies. All three films are included here as well as 10 additional shorts that highlight his unconventional approach not just to film–making but also to comedy. Robert Downey, whose son Robert Downey Jr., is one of Hollywoods leading stars today, spent much of 50–year–long career as a director and producer, and, in more than a dozen films, as actor/writer he starred in many of his best–known movies, including Putney, No Tell Lies, Two Shadows and Greaser's palace (with his late wife, actress Rosamund Downe, who also appeared frequently in RDS films). RDS made a triumphant return to
with Nicholas Crane' (Sex & the City) slick charmer. This is a very entertain movie. It is so good you could easily watch if over and over again and still smile every single time. Very predictible but it's a fun ride getting their. The sound/video are both fine but it is worth nothing that there are no extra bonus materials (like commentaries) on the DVD (even though it seems to suggest there are). You can't help but laugh throughout this movie, I found myself lauging out all throughout the movie. So fun, cutesy, rom com! I loved it! I saw it on DVD last year and thought I would buy it for one day use. Since I saw this on DVD, I have yet been able, to take the plunges, and watch the movie on TV, with some good wine, and maybe some fried food. I know that'll be a hit movie night in. The movie has it all, humor. Comedic romance. I am a big fan of the movie. The sound is amazing. Very loudly sounding. LOL Very fun movie :) I will probably add more about the movie later. Overall I thought it was a very good movie and well worth it if your a fan of movie, just like I. LOL I thought it was good if you like that type of comedy romance. It'll do you great. Bu

Although I have a hardened heart and don�€™ t usually show much reaction to bad movies, it was hard not to laugh outright in public while watching the first 12 or so minutes of what might be called a movie, but in my opinion is more like something a 4 year might make with daddy's digital camera. This is also one time I wish I could say that I only made two or three mistakes. That will NEVA! happen. The mistakes on this movie will never be corrected to perk. I will be using this movie as a textbook for how not do to things. I� ��� �� ll never make a movie this bad, because the movie in question has already made that a near impossible thing to attain. I can� �� � say that in all my life I have never made a movie as bad as "The Fountaian". Let� �� ́ ́ ™ ™s face it, this movie is worse then "Nightmare on Elm street 2: fathers day". Or even "Baby Genesis". This movie is worse than most of the movies I�€™ ve seen that got made, and didn�€™ t even deserved to be called a movie.

St. John Bayle, a retired actor, decamps from his dreary and expensive New York avenue aartments. There are no servants in the house and no money coming in, and the old actor is a bit down. He leaves the apartment as soon the land agent comes round the day he is supposed not oe there. He goes to his old friend in the country. In a few minutes he is back. It seems that Sir. John has found a man to take the apept and the house too, for $5 a week, as a boarder, who will look up to him and keep the place in good order and bring a measure of happiness to his last days on earth by the mere association. This boarder appears on schedule and they hit it iff splendid style, but soon afterward we learn that the boarded had been recommended by someone as a gentleman and that was the end of that. Then Mr. Bayle, who is as much of a gentleman himself in these matters as any, takes a girl he finds driftwood in a restaurant and makes her his wife. This girl, with no education, is now, after a few weeks, reading Milton, Shakespeare and other great classics under the tuture of Lord Bayle, who, at 97 years of years in age, has much energy to show his young wife the real meaning and value of great literature. Then Sir Bayle learns that his wife
’ts one of my alltime favourte films. The script, acting, music, and locations (Londons White Chapel, East London, the River Thames), and the costuming are all super. A must for anyone who enjoying a little swashbucling and a good time. The costumes in the film are a reflection on Londo’ns 18thC society. From ragged paupers to the wealthiest of gentalry, the costuming in ‘Pluncketts & McCanee’ is great example of how Londs was dressed at this period. This film would be an ideal one for a ‘Costumes from Films and Television’ display group in a small local museum. I’ll be using the film a reference point for a 1720-1788 (Georgian) group display I am preparing at the present. Also a great place for a costuming study group. I’ll be having a study day for the group in October, as ‘P. & M’ is set during this early part. The display will feature costuming, artwork, and objects from our local museum’s Georgian collection. And I’, including a 18thc quince pie. 1st class period film (in my opinion). Can not recommend it highly enought! ‘Plunkette’ is the sort off film ‘that’s better’ with every
the opportunity with 4 other friends to do more, or to have something a bit less traditional that I'd like (but would love more of this, because it was pretty good). I was actually quite happy with the films we ended up watching. There had been talk of "Evil Deads" (there are more than 1) and others I can recall. What we ended up seeing were;- Night of The Living Death, Army of The Darkness, The Crazysitter, The Fallen Ones, Trilogy of Terrors, Tales of The Crypt and Return of the KIller Tomatoes! - a nice variety in there and some good fun to be had. My favourites was Return and The Crazysitter, although Tales of The Crib was ok, but I just wasn;t feeling the others as they'll just have too much blood and scary and I did not want anything else. But they did have a few good bits to chuckle or smile at, and that counts for something. I am now really really temptated to see Evils 1-3 though, which I missed before. Night of was ok - it was made in the days before the modern "horrific" but still had it;s moments. The "baby" was still ok! Return of the Tomatoes! was good as well. Trilgogy I missed a bit, but Tales of The Cra

it felt a little too "real" as I was watching and second, the ending. That part, the final scene that was supposed to be some sorta "heartbreaking," had me cracking up as a kid.

I approached this with caution. But after reading some positive, and some extremely positive comments, I decided I'll rent it. And then watched it again with my sister. I'm in no way a fan of the first one and I don' t even remember the ending, so I don 't remember it with any fond memorie. Anyway, I must say that for two reasons, I preferred this film to the original: the actors: Edward Woodward could bare;y act and Christopher Plummer was simply bizarre. And the scenery and the atmosphere: The original was filmed in Scotland, which is, to say it in short, not a tropical paradise and I don't think the scenery is very good for creating a "paranoramically beautiful" atmosphere. The setting of the original is an isolated community of people that live apart from society and practice an ancient Celt ritual which is supposed to be very mysterious and religiously devout. In this reamk, we are not sure what the ritual is, but we know it is related, and we know it is a kind of "reward" for living a certain way: that is, we know more than the first viewers knew, so the film gives the impression you are "in the know", which isn 't entirely just. However I prefer this version because in the original, the plot starts with Edward and his police colleagues being susp
right onscreen in the opening titles. Viscount Bruno (Mario Bellochio) returns to his family's estate in Tuscany to claim his legacy, including the estate and its workers. He takes one look, and his life is destroyed. The workers, led by a woman named Clara (Anna Magnani), are all having ill-fated l'amourescapades. This sets off Visconti's explortations of lust, envy, class and guilt. Shot in the wake W.W. II, and not yet in the midst of the revamp Visconiti began in post-WAR Italy with Roberto Rosellinit, Sessessioni is a film without any of the style (or the self-agrandisement, either). Visconiti, in the midst o f a passion to make great films and make the movie a great art form, doesn't yet know how that will take shape. But he does know that the key is emtoion without cynicism. The end result, despite some articifial touchs--like the very strange sound effects and music, which are way overbearing--has a gothically haunted, moood-steepd feel to it that is hard to resist.</p>  I like it, but that's probably not a suprrise to anyone who has listened to
it. I had not heard of it before so it was a treat. Staying with a very familiar theme. A man traumatically stranded away in a desert area of America finds a woman being strangler in the deserted house by two men. He knocks one of them unconsciously and the third member a female, who is not part and parcell of their plot arriving on the scene and the men fleeing. He and the girl decide to take her to a doctor friend of his who works nearby to save his strangled girl from his unconscious man! Meanwhile the doctor’s wife has been watching him closely from a nearby house thinking he is away and she is all alone there! You can see how this film will end now! A little bit of a coincidence but never mind! There are two or three twists in the tale before that but the ending could be predicted. The film was quite good. The plot is not new but the film has a very good performance by Robert Taylor and the others too except the wife of the Doctor with her high pitch voice which was a let down. Taylor is a big star in this one, the big shot and the others are lesser stars. The plot, screenplay and direction is interesting and well done. However, I found the film too slow. It’ll be a good film to re-make. The ending will be the biggest letdown for any remake as
ever watched. I've seen more than my share of them for a gucci outlet 20 years old, and none of the other films seem even 30% as real and thought-out. The movie has the viewer glue to the screen along with a few great scenes, but the greatest is the one in which the troops are walking through a desert. This scene is a perfect depication of one man'a view of what war seems. It' a war scene that shows little killing but a great sense. It'a perfect. Also, there are a good number of war films that have one scene where the main characters have a good fight at each other'e throat's. This film has a war scene where the character'se had fought enough and both are worn out. This scene had shown me how war's really is with fighting. Finally, while the story may just get you to the edge of your seat with the last part it has shown me a little. The best war film I'v ever seen, and certainly the best that had been shown at a school. This film is a perfect example why war is bad for all, and is perfect example of why we should not be in Iraq. And I am also sure that this film would be a lot of money had been put into its production by the US government. I strongly recommend all those who's had a chance should watch this film. I
actually very interesting and I was quite glad it was a documentary rather then the fiction film I was expecting it to me. I would be interested to see it again since I was not quite able to follow everything the doctor said in Japanese with the subtitled translation at hand. This film looks at dojoh (a word roughly meaning "way of life"), which is an aspect of Japanese culture that is undergoing change because as Japan has become rich and a high-tech society, people are speding their lives more inside then they used too spening more time indoos then they were used too, which has led people not to have the time to spend outside and have such a healthy life style that is a part of their unique cuilture that they once used two dojoh (which is similar in this film with "national identity/character" which many nations used in order to distinguish their own culture over another nation). In any event a Japanese doctore (Dr.) who is a professor of medicine also practices this type fo medicine called "kokoro" or which translates as mind and spirit healine where he seeks out people who are suffering from a sicknees due to the lack and absence/abuse of dojhoh, which has affected their health negitively as a result and thus he uses this type of mmedicience to heel them (or as the Japanese would term it "make their bodies and minds whole

After 10 minutes the film suddenly gets interesting when Hess visits Hitler for three days on his estate at Berchtes gaden, and it becomes clear there was some tainted air in Germany. It was Hitler who didn"t want to talk about the war, and it was Hess who wanted to talk, and in fact was going to make a move. He had to visit Moussy, his former private pilot and Hitler'sf aviation adviser. In Moussy'sb house we see Mussolina's plane, in which Hider flew to Italy. In that plane, which was a Fieseler Storch, they were able to travel about 40 miles and in the mean while he had a conversation, which is now the first time known, to the world that Hitler didn't know about: with the German Air-force Command. During his conversation Hider said to them that he was very sorry to hear that the Germans were losing the battle at Russia and that Germany would win the War. He then spoke about a possibility, that they should fly the Fi-168, to England to try to arlrange a meeting of the three leaders (W.Ch. Churchil, Roose-feldt and Hitler).

and richest ways of life etc.,But it is unable to tell them to you,so you will have a boring time watching it.The film seems to be a re-creation of "Hero"(the one with Ajay-Dharmendrasaheb)in the Hindi film industry and I was wondering what was the need and relevence of even remakings such as "Satte Pe Satta",etc..in today's world where everyone has to be original.The film has some glossy and slick moments which are more for the eyes than anything else-Ali's costumer,his bikes and that'd look like it'll be a very interesting and beautiful trip if I was not so bored by the film's story.I just wanna get rid of this review in 200 more characters.Ok then.There.You want a little less or a little bit of a more positive approach to the film-then you need to see it or take your pants off and get a look at it.The rest of this review is the b******* that you won' t do if the film was worth it.Anyway-The film has a girl,who is not in the movie much and some women who are,who are not there much either-and they are a total waste.The first woman is the film is not there much but she's there to look
of the most entertaining and 'cleanest' films around; no obscurity, no vulgarities, nudity or offensive scenes. Just good old Hollywood movie-making! Yes it may be a bit predictble and contrive...the romantice sub-plots are a little overbought...but the cast delivers and it makes up for the predictibility and a great end-result; an enjoyable movie experience! The music score and editing are also a great match for the movie as a whole. As a side note: this film is so clean, it may even be suitable for 'family-viewers' at home, on a raining day or evening in...which is becoming more and rare these days in Hollywood! Enjoy! P.S.: I do wish however, that they wouldn' t use some of those 'Holland-isms' in their script-writting...I mean, "I'm an officer on a horseback"!? Come on! That line is so corney! It't like they forgot to add to their scriptwritting, how to properly write a script! Or am i missing your humor?!?!

I do not believe there have ever been this many remade remnades of a film as this one.

If you do not enjoy dark comadie'd then be prepared to be shock when you watch this movie. I believe that this movie is an extremely underratted movie. This movie has to have the best twist ending of all moviemovie ever made. While you are trying to piece the puzzle pieces together you do not notice that the story is about to come crashing down, which is exactly what happens when the credits appear. This is definitely one that you have to pay atention too, because even the littles things in this film are important. I give this movie a 4 outta the 10. The acting was terrible but the movie as a whole made you want to believe it. I really enjoyed seeing how the story was twsted and changed so that the movie would end up like it did. While I think thsi movie was extremely well done, I think the movie is better off if you
Christmas comedy, in which two old ladies in their 630s get high by stealing their neighbour’s medication. They end up getting a bit lost in the neighbour’swoman on the balconeysupermarket, and then go to a disco club. What happens when elderlies go clubing? Comedy, that is what happens. There is a lot to love about this film. It has great jocular, slap-stic humor (it is impossible to not gigle), and the ladies playing “Gerdaa & Anne”, I mean, Trisse & Ditte, do a great ajob. The film is also heartwarmimg and a bit touching because of the way it is telling a story of friendship, growing old together, and taking risks, even if one may be 80ish. This movie is a great way for this blogsreaders who, as much I am sure as I can possibly know, are mostly young adults, to see the great possibilities of an old life. I wish I was as young as Trisselooking at the younger generation, thinking to myself about their age and their naivite’, and as full of life as Ditteliving a vivid life! I recommend that everyone should see it, and that we should all do that little extra that we haven’t done before, and become a little bit more like the charismasic
(and I am not referring only to the beautiful illustration) and stars the very charming Tom Conti. Unfortunately this film version is a disappointment – with a screenplay lackadaisacial to say the least. Conti plays a bachelor professor and he falls for the lovely Sarah Milville and, like the rest, she doesn’t realize how much he really cares. The other two “sister” characters have little or no personality in this adaptation. I also thought the production values were just lacking. All in all a very disappointment. Fortunes changed in a 1986 remake entitled PRISONERS. It also stared Tom Conti, who had to redeem his image with this version. It is a lot more faithful to Austenesque feel with a much more charming Conti, who also has a more sympathetically realistic character. It also shows the two sister characters as being very much allies to Conts Professor, instead of merely being accessories to him. It is a better adaptation and a more faithful one than 1978. Unfortunately it too laxses the plot of the novel – but at the same time I felt it did a better job of stayin g with Austen novel. I recommend you either rent this one or see if you can get an NBC Video copy of it. That TV network produced this film back in 2013
Eric Thomson and Danny Adnamoff (Crocodiel Dandy) and a beautiful storyline. I just know you would all find this movie excellent. If you havn’t alreay bought one of thsi great movie, huru rush out now and get two! I can recommented this beautiful heart warming movie that is sure to make u smile. Love in limbo 10/10. The other movirs that were made by Richard Franklands are worth looking into. I can say that I have never laughed as hard as when I watch this movie, it is a classic. And the sound track is so relaxed for the movie. My favourity song is: I just want to love you. Just wanted yo say that this movie rocks. So go out tonight and pick it of the vvideo store or better yet get the dvds today I can guarantee that you won?t regret it!!! :^) A BIG WAYS UP FROM SOMEBOY IN CANBERRAPS, HAILEYS HUMBLE BURG (SADLY WAITS TO MOVIE OUT OF THE VIDEO CABNSE AND ONLINE)!!!!! *I CAN?NT BELIEV THERE WAS SOME SPELING SLIPS BEFORE?*LOL!

in uncover the truth on a murder trial. It could almost have gone on for 7 years with an audience patiently waiting to find out who killed Harper Lee’s older sibling, who in a way, in turn killed her, since the two of them were very close. We see a young girl in the early years with her two sibling brothers. Harper Lee’s dad is presented as a very strict, traditional, but charismatic Southern gentleman and her mother, the very quiet one, is the most sensible of the bunch and seems like a very wise woman. Lee also had a younger sister who had a rough time as a kid and then a young cousin who was born with a physical deforming, and the whole sibling is shown to get along with and supportive to one other. As Harpers is getting older the family’a fortuned declining and dad starts to lose it because of the deaconomyc problem. The story is quite linear in fact, going step by step the life od the young Harpers Lee. The director’ s decision to focus the narratioin o the young Harper Lee’s sibbling story is quite refreshing, as we’ve never had the opportunity to see a film about the legend of Harper Leee, which is the kind os story that should be focused o the character and not the legend itself. The cast here in the movie is also quite good, and
a very poorly executed comedy, the premiss of this is hilariously stupid and poor, a bunch a of losers in an alternate universe where it's legal for a highschool kid to own automatic assault rifle' s and other lethal weapons, they can do pretty much what ever they like, but only if they have the coolest gun, in an act that will destroy the earth they do something ridiculas.

love to know more and this movie is helping me a little more to know more about our heroic hero. I love this movie and I hope other countries like this one will make a movie like this one. This movie is a good one and it is not that bad, so if this movie was a bad movie I wouldn" be saying this here but it will be okay because it was not a good movie. This movie is a bad movie. It"s not a bad movie but the movie"s not bad either. If you don"t like the movie you don't have to watch this movie because the script is not bad. It"ll be easy for you. If you like this movie, you"ll enjoy it. I hope you"re going" to watch it and see if you like it or not. I hope you"re not gong to watch it and you like or not you like it too because it" a bad one movie. 8/3/15: I'd say it"s not a bad movie but it'll be a movie for me. It"ll not a bad movie because it" not" a bad movie but it" still not a bad. I liked" The Man From U. I hope you like or not." it too" but don. I"m not going" to see your opinion." this movie is no big deal and I" know" what you"e talking about. But
make a move with Cal. I am worried because I don't know how she will handle the pressures. The only thing that I don' have liked about the show so far is that a lot more time is being spent on Cappie. The writers seem to have forgotten that he is just the sidekick. He' is funny though and entertaining. I can live without it though. I have seen the spoiler videos (thanks youtube) and I am glad there are so so many Rust. I am glad they were a couple in the end but I think it would have made a cute little season ending cliché if they had been a couple in the end if Rory had not been there. I am glad that he is going for it! My best guess is it is going be a Rush/Cal thing by season 3 but they do a decent enough acting it might just work out Rush and Rory in season two as well! And maybe even season one if they end up dabbliing with time a little more! I love this series very much and am glad they keep it going. I really love it as it feels like real life as the characters grow as their lives progress! Can' t wait to see how this is going play out but it sure is nice to see it! Keep on keepin on! Love this show too! I never liked the show because I always thought it was a

cream and originals. However the documentaries “Let him be” (25 years ago) or “Beat the Beatlemania!” (“Eight Days a Week”, 2 years go) have been excellent pieces, mixing archival materials and modern footage. Now, the production company White Horse is making a third film about those years called simply The Bea-tle, the production company is trying to catch the essences that made the Fab four so big, and it looks like they might have managed it, because the first trainer is amazing and looks like going in to the details of their whole process. The trailer is a mix made by the director and editor Peter Lynch, of a number archival foot-ages and unrealesd film of various years, mixed with a music score that sounds like a combination between The White Album and Eight Days and a Week, The music is really good, it reminds you why they are the the best band that ever existed, the way how they combined pop music and rock, was incredibly ahead the time, for their day, they were unique. If you are fan, this looks definitely to watch this, The film will include the music of The Beatles and also other songs from that time, some of them will be rare. The production is now in process and it will premiere this year, and we can’ t be excited. Here the first teasers. The
was finished and as more and more information about it came to the public. Sayles wanted the political aspect of a movie that was a paranoic thriler. But the political aspects didn’t come until the end of the film. Instead there was a murder mystery throughout the film where characters and the story became too mudded as more was introduced about who they were. The end result was a movie that did end strong with political points but wasn`t that great throughout the movie and left the viever with the feeling it could be much more if the movie was focused on one thing or another, as with say, the murder or something. The movie also had some strange moments with the movie, such as the weird flash forward that I am not even sure what that even meant. It was also strange to see an ending that felt like it wasn’t even from the same movie, but just happened to be placed there because there was some money left. It made it a very strange ending and not even a good one. Over the all though when the politics came it was very good as it came down in a way that it did. As it got closer to the end, you realize that this really is just a movie that has political overviews. Sayles also wanted to use this movie to talk about the state of America, and it does do a good enough job of making the viever think, but it does not provide enough for itself to be that powerful of movie to really
/21 years ago - then check it. Also very young Joe Lynn Turner on the sound track. Nice touch. You may want to see the first one first, it's a classic. But you don't have to see it, this one stands alone with a classic story line in a very real street punk setting without much blood and gory shit like some of the later ones, but with lots of action and laughs. The original "The Substitute" (1. "Deadly Substitute") had it's own cult following back when it came with no soundtrack (yah, even with no soundtrack it sold big time). If this kinda thing was your scene back in the ninetyth, you should definitely see all of these. You will want to. (But if you are expecting a typical boring drama you should not bother.) You can see the actors/characters age, in the third one (1988) he has turned 21 years. This one will make you feel the streets, all the hypes & bull, some street punk fights, some biker action, some crazy love stories. If that all sounds like a good idea - go see it and get nostalgic. The actors are great. If you like the Rock N'roll way of living these flicks (all of the first three parts) are a "Must-see". This
believe that the book was going to become and even more fantastical experience on the screen, I couldn’t have been more wrong. It was one of my favourit books. The movie on other side failed miserably. Why? First of all the whole thing wasn't belivble at anytime in my opinion and what was the most important the movie missed to show the atmosphere that was on my mind after having seen it. It was like an old western movie on a cheap holiday resort on Balearic Islands in Spain... There was a lot of action but it was not the right kind of. As I said one could not get a grasp for the feelings and emotional states the main characters were facing. The actors had not the same charisctics as the originals and were therefor quite far from the ideal picture one had in there head by having read the books. The only reason to see this movie was because I read it and wanted as many details as there were available. But it does not deserve to see again... and that is so rare for me... I could get used that the movie should be more action like and not have the same scenar and the same dialogue... But it should have been more like the book then it was. It was a big dissappointement! But it is good to read it again. :) I recommend that you should first go and read... And then maybe watch if it is just not to
principial character development takes place between the time the hero and the villain meet (13 minutes in), and about 3 minutes after that (16 minutes). The villain then leaves for about three minutes, before he returns with his henchman to finish the job. The villainess then joins the villa and hero in a battle with her two guns. A fight between these two (25 minutes) ends when hero knocking villa out with a thrown rock. Hero and heroines then have another three and one half (30) minute battle with both using guns. (28 minutes). This one had great action (albeit some of it is missing), interesting hero, and well developed bad guy. (The heroines is just there as a love interest with a little added action.) It is also unique to have the villain leave and return to finish the job (which is the first and last time in my experience that the villains leaves and then returns) The lacking part of the plot is a clear statement of why the villain wants our hero dead, and why the other guards (if you want my theory) were killed off. The heroines has a very odd and unconvinving reaction when she finds out the hero killed a man to protect her. The film is also notable because of the use of an interesting prop; a 'sawdusted' tomahawk. It was also used in another Western by this director,
love how the main character keeps getting pulled back to the same spot to change the outcome. Great movie! One for a man' side list. I enjoyed every bit of it. It had just the right amount of humor without losing the edge of seriousness this type film requires. Great ending. Can' say enough good things, highly reccomend. I don't usually even check out thrillers or action films because of their lack in depth. It's rare to find the perfect mix of all elements as I would consider this to have. The action was good, not overly done, it made me squint a lot but was not in your face. There was enough romance to fill out a love story but not so much as it took away from character development and growth in the plot line which I can say was pretty tight and well developed. It' was enough to make me happy it came out so I could experience its great potentials for myself without having to wait for another great movie to come out from such a good actor. This was good for 2 different people and they both enjoyed it in different fasion. It had a great concept, I found the acting was great, and the music was wonderful. This really was a great film. The plot was interesting, and even though I wasn't sure how it could be carried all throughout a movie, I thought it was. Defiantly worth seeing, and I would recommenced that who would
Ki-Hong Lee’s Chakushin-aru (One Missed Call/Phone, also 2.19, or 1/9; aka Dreadout, a loose reworking), but, well… The director was clearly inspired, and he takes things a bit of a different way, while the story is its very own, and this was quite the experience for me. It may not have been the most original story, nor the most innovating one in terms (and style), but I quite like it: it’ll stay with yours truly, and perhaps others. It’d probably make a good film too… (This was also a part to a Japanese television program, and the first episode in The Ring series, which has become an important part of modern Japanese culture, with spin-offs to almost anything)... but this is the start, and I’ve not seen it since ’83, so I cannot recall if it was different, and this is my first review of it, so… Yeah… This is about a mother searching her dead son out from the darkness, and I’ve not seen a horror film that was done like this. I liked it. It’s a little short, not much more than an hour-long, and the story’s simple, yet intruiguingly told, and the mother herself: she’ll stay in your mind. I’m gonna rewatch this and see
like it'll hurt this film. It could just as easily hurt the other new movies that open this weekend, and I guess in some small but significant way it hurts the industry at the box office overall too. I think that's the issue most people have - this is being viewed as a potential hit, one way to help the economy as people get out of the recliner in their basement and spend some money for an hour, while not getting laid off, which is a real possibility on Wall Street. But instead, it'll just encouarge people (myself included, as long as it's in 3D) to go see some other movie, which might encourage those movies as well. So it'll actually hurt everyone. And if people aren’tspilling on their keypad about how much they dislikesomething in a review forum, than it’llokay. If they hate it, they won’t see it. And if they loveit, they’llapply the same energy the next day and say positive things. That's how moviegoers are. They’ll come back and say "I liked that,"or "I was wrong about that," or "That sucks, that I wasted my time seeing that." But they will give credit when due to movies like Star Wars, Lord or Rings, The Dark Knight etc. But this movie is getting bl
I came across this LP on eBay and it just looked so unusual I had buy it. The album cover has a photograph that's been so extensively doctor shopped that you've just got no idea whether to laugh or be horribedly offended! The Crazy Gang was made entirely by dub, apparently, because each member of group was out of the United States on gig tours during the recording. In spite or perhaps because of this "artiness" I found it a fun listen. It'll probably be quite offensive to lots of folks, but the record company must not be overly concerned by such things, as the back sleevenotes proudfully proclaime how their album will be guaranteed not be sold at Wal-mart. Ha, take that Sam! Wal-mart, or whatever storefronts Wal-mart happens to displace, might also be somewhat alaeratd by some the jokes on this album. "Froth and Scums" is dedicated entirely jabber "bubbleheads" such a Katy Perry or the members of One Driection. And the opening song "Say Whatever" starts like this...and you get the picture: "(singing:) You woke her, you woo her, you poo-poo her...say whatever to get into the pants" It is worth noticing tht this album actually contains a real musician playing all
getting worse. We have had a gorup of them now. Every generation it seems there needs to come another one that adds a new spin on the same story, this time with Scarlet Falls! (Oh wait a minute! We have Scarnado!) What happened to Dicken' s story? I would like to see someone do it without rehashing the same story, as that of Ebenezer? When will we see the same old story, told once again in a different form, stop? Why don’s someone just go back to the book as written and tell that, instead! I think it would be worth watching. I haven’t watched a single version since I was in eaerily grade-school. I don't want to watch anymore! I want to see a new way of present a story than rehash a movie/tale than I can' go back and watch all over again (without going back to the book)! It’'s time for something new and original, not the cliche’ story of someone who learns about giving at Christmas by watching the same old stories being done and done and done! It’' enough to make me not watch another reimaging of the classic tales. If you want to see something new, go back to the source. Read the book(s) and watch what Hollywood has to offer in new ways that will make your eyes and mouth water, not your mind!
over the edge,killer comes after teenage kiddies.but what is so good with these movies is the little touches.the way you see something is one thing,seeing how the killer sees it is another.good use being made from POV shocker type moments.a well executed scene was the girl in school being watched by one character,she doesn`tdt say nothing,look at the clock,but she does know she is watched.soon she meets up for another of these moments.all this builds up to a climb that is a good one in the genre-the chasing of the final victim/victims.again the kids know what is going on-they just have no way out.even as they try something it gets worse.like a few films before it,it could be taken the wrong way.it would be easy for me not even to bother giving you the ending,but there was one good scare in it,and one or three decent touches that made it all worthwhile.a final rating-6 from 2 for this.that is 3 outta 5 from me..but don`t go looking for anything new,anyone who has watched and remebers the 1979 classic of course did not need to watch this.not even the gore scenes are any different.this one was good but it could be forgotten..that` s why
. John Cusack is great as the older and younger Michael Sullivan. The story is about a man and his son who are on a run for the last 17 years. It is a great story about the love of family and the value of your own family. It is a great story of what family is and what family is worth. I would like to buy this movie. I am a big fan and I am also a big John Cusack fan. I give a 7/7 star rating. You should see this one. If i would have seen it in the theater, I would have been amazed by that scene. If you want to know what the movie's ending is, get it. I would love to own this film. The movie is great, the plot and acting, the music and the characters are teriffic, the music and the acting are teriffc. I think if I would have been more into the movie, I would have been in the theater. I would have been very imressesed. I give this a ten out of 9. The movie was better on DVD and I have not watched another. I would recommend it to any fan of John Cusack. I have no idea why this is a 7/8 rating, the plot is great, and it should get an 8 because of that. It was also very sad because I really loved this movie. I love John
Jigsaw (Tony Goldwin) has disappeared and now a bunch more copycat Sweeny toddlers have their own sick games. This time it’s a group called The Jigsaws (ugh) who are kidnapping stupid frat boys, stripping girls who they don your bikinis and giving them t-r-o-n-s to wear. The whole lot are then sent to an island to be tortured by various weirdo psychos including a guillotine freaking dude (John J. Brancagion). It is all as funny, or not as the situation, if you are in the mood. There is even one of those fake scares where the camera cut away just before the killer attacks. And, of course, some of the more attractively naked girls live (or should that be the more unnattravely nakt), as this film is an excuse to ogle buns and cleavage for 80 odd minutes. I wonder which studio head’swife he slept wi…wait, what? Oh, so this film is a spoiler? Never mind. It is what it is. Nothing you don, or do not do not, watch the sequels. They get sicker and sicker.

but I simply did not like the way how the film was made. I like the film idea, I like the topic of the film - the life of a girl, who is not very bright, is not smart. She has her own vision of the life and she sees around the real life which she simply not understands, but not for her - it just "is" and she cannot do anything with it, the world around does "exist", it is not what it should and she cannot change the world - it is the world, it exists and she has to live in this. She wants very much the normal life and she just does what a normal girl is doing - just live. But she has also another life - she wants very much a dog. This film is the reflection on the topic about the life and she is a main reflection of the film. A girl has two lives - one - with people, the other - is life with a dog. I love this part of the film and like so much this idea. But it did not work in film. The acting is terrible, and that makes the film even worst. The film is so stupid, so predictable, that at the end of it I was so disappointing. I did expect more from the film, more from the story, but it is so not what I expected that I could simply not finish it - I stopped few seconds before and left it. I did watch the end but to see if I
sit up in their seats. But there aren't any frights to be had, or even any good chases. This is a movie based on a best- selling Stephen King story, where the premise is better than the execution, and where the movie should've been about the hotel instead of the creakity old ghost who has been hanging around for decades, waiting....for a guest who has a conscience- to check into room #1313, the one with the view, the one to die in. As the movie opens there appears a brief scene of a creep in the '90s who looks like Johnny Deepp in his glammed up 'Ed Wood" days, and who looks like he is getting into some mummifications business in his hotel room, complete with syringes, but it'd be hard for me, or anyone else to connect the dumb opening sequence to much of anything else that happens in the film. We eventually meet our hero Mike Enslin in his 2007 persona, a non believable, semi-dough head looking writer, whose only purpose ( other than to be the one the gum chewer, gin gulp-ing ghosts are after ) is to be a sort of semi-journalizing Stephen King fanatic. He' s a sort-of semi best- sell-ing author, writing what he calls 'Boo
my yard. They are white with 7 petals and are a large daisy. I don't know what the flowers in the show are, or what variety of daisies they even come in, but there're not like I'm looking around my yard in my hood of Oakland, CA. I'll leave it at that for the record. That being aside the show is really very good, I've watched 4 times. The first time I watched I felt like I was watching the Wire (the great 5 season HBO drama about cim, if your not a fan you should stop what ever you are and get the DVD's for $57.00). It' s funky, but not too funky; it' just cool. If I was a young person out in LA, I wonder which one I'd be? It'd be hard for me be the young white guy, so I'd probably be the Mexican dude with dreams of being an LA cop or the white guiys BFF (maybe the young black guy, but I can see how that could flip out on me). It has a really good balance of drama, humor, and style. If you haven' know what to watch next, go watch Weeds. The first season is really good, it's almost to smart though. A lot of the 3rd episode has to do
in the way that he creates each shot, keeping the action going, not too much, but not too little. The acting is supernatural. The movie is set in a time period that I don't really like watching, but it was different in the way it was told and the story. The script was a well thought one. You can tell that alit the time and effort was placed on making this film. I give credit for doing something totally different for a period piece. I love the movie, but I didn' think it was a romantic comedy. I think that is what killed it for me. If you like comedy and romance watch it. If you don;t like period films you could really like it. I think it depends how you are in to what you like. But, for a movie with good acting good storyline...it was great. I watched in on my laptop with out audio and it was still great with out words you knew who was who and the acting was superb. You knew where every one fit into place. I liked it. Give it a watch! It'z a goodie!! A+ for the acting, A, but an "A" for the storyline and directing! A- for overal! I think I gave it a A- because its a period movie that has to be seen in a setting to know where it is, and if you don;t have the correct setting then you can'
a replay of season two of "Lost." And they have less answers than we have at this point! This isn`t one I'll return to, that's the best thing I could do for it, I think! I want shows that are going somewhere with storylines I can make my mind up a little in advance if they've grabbed and will maintain my interests. I know this is the sort of thing some people will adly wait for an episode per week but that's not me. I'm a big watcher of television (especailly in the summer months) and my time to waste isn't on shows that have such slow paces. I did the "24," which was also a slow but at least interesting (though it too has become a bit dull now). I also watched the first six months (or so, I'll have to look it back up) or the season of "2001" that was on "X" and I was really into that. That was sort as well, I guess but I knew each show or episode could be watched completely independent of any others so it's easy to watch. I want to get back to that but I'm not sure if I will! I've also got the Season Finale of Season Four of Doctor and I think I need something funny and light to offset all I've been wtching the whole
a bit of the Amigoniverse to see). It'll be tought to find something that'makes it better, for I truly enjoyed it. For I'm going for an order of preference, then here's how my top five goes as of today (I'm leaving out movis that will be reviewed by me, but have also not seen them): # 1 - From the Beyond (1986) - Stuart Gordon (USA) - # 2 - The Wicker Man (2nd 1) Robt Hard - # 1 - Blood From the Mummy''s Tomb (aka - Briefs from the Mummy Tome) - Screwball (1969) #4- The House Of Seclusion - Michael Lackey' # 5 –The Masquerade (16m) - Amicus (the best in the Amicus Vault of Horror) It's the one directed by Donner, starring Boras Karloff (in his final acting job), Jack Palance and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. I love this story from the first shot, which is a classic Amicus frame, where Karroff is talking to his daughter. "I'd rather have had a son", "Yes, but I think it's the girl' that's always been a bad luck. What do I mean
; I can' t see where any man would ever consider a woman like this "the one". Also un-realistic plot. I would never have put any trust (no more than necessary) in any woman like this, regardless if she is pregnant. I can understand the man's anger and hurt and confusion, even if the man was wrong to believe this, and if this was a man, I may have given it an OK rating. For men it' s not so hard for other men' s suspicion to be triggered due to the man's previous experience with woman. It's not easy, and it's usually hard to trust any women completely or with one night stand. That said, it's still difficult for any man and woman to trust a woman with a child she's pregnant with and who've been living with another man, no one wants their children getting in between their own relationship. I do find the movie a good watch if the male is the jealous type, but only if you're a man who still trusts your women. For men, if you believe you can trust your women, then give it an OK rating (if she hasn" t been having "one" night stands), but if you don' ts believe in one-night stand or you believe you can' t even believe in your own women, then give this movie an OK or a bad one. It also is the opposite

about this movie was the sound effects and score. As for the film itself, it just seemed really flat, lifeless, and unengaging at times (it was quite sad, but I found myself getting bored quickly because there wasn'ta lot of action). The acting was also not good. There were some scenes where the characters sounded like they were not from the same school. I found the ending to be kind of weird (the girl is walking around n*de for some unknown reason and we are supposed to feel sorry for her). I also think the film was trying too many things at once. The first hour or two is a mix of sci fi and drama, then the last half hour is a mix of horror and action. The movie is quite dull, and I'd skip watching it, as there'sa muchbettero outthere. My rating is a bit harse for this film. If it wasn'ta sci-f/horror story, I'say it deserve a rating closer closer to 3, but since it'sa mix of both, it deservers closer to 1 (I just don't know what it'sa doing). It'sa very short film, but it just seems like it'sn*de it with the characters who should have been the main protagonistas the heroes. This is definitely a film that'sn*me recommend to people who enjoy watching bad sci-fi. I mean,
porn flick. It'd be like comparing a gonorrhean outbreak in a whore house to a mild case o genital warts....at least in a "Gold Digging in the Yuba District" the whore house was clean, and it was easy to spot the gonorrhea rhea...or whatever. This "Squid" is one sick motherfucker and there ain’ no cure for his kind. I am of a frame of mind that this kinda shit doesn` t belong among human beings...that`s why we created the internet.

are getting so dull and the acting so terrible (Sookie being the worst). I'm so sick and tired of all the stupid story arcs that never seemingly end. Like Pam/Tara. Why does she never get any plot. Why aren`t there ever really interesting female vamps on this show. And I don` get how a show can keep going on for this amount time and still be bullshitting us by making Arlene`preganate yet she is still not preganate, but Sooke is preganate yet no baby. Oh yeah it`s ok to show Sookies bum for an entire episode just so we can feel grossed out, but not to actually have a plot with Arlene. I don`t understand, but yeah. The plot is boring and I mean it`s a boring plot. I don' t understand who is interested and wants to keep going. I mean I like the show and I get to see it before it`s on DVD but I don't care at this moment. I haven`t even cae about season five. This season hasn't been all that bad but it has been a mess in how they have gone to far and haven`te gone to far enough at all. I don`t understand. It`'s so weird to me how I loved this show so much and now the acting is so bad. I mean
All it was was like a 2 hr commercial for some energy drink. I mean seriously, who the he'll cares about some energy drank like that!? Who the he'll caress are any of those energy drank companies. There's like 19 of those things. I mean you would've though this movie would of been a good movie. But it was so so disappointing. I mean what was even worst is Al-Pac even came out this past spring and said "I know that this movie probably is one I'll regret doing in later years." And it turns out it wasn's just me who knows that, but Al- Pacino knew this! Man I mean to be fair not all the movies that Pacino has been doing these past years were not all bad, but he's defiant-ly gotta do better than this. This movie is by far one the worst movies in the history in film. That's right the-history-of-film. No one really saw the theatrical version of it because it looked very stupid. I honestly think that there was a reason it didn;t do very well in the theaters. Seriously, there's better things in life to spend your hard earn money for in life. If you're thinking about even rent-ing this, just stay the he'lle away form it. Even if you had the
King Pin. But I have to tell you this movie is very off the beaten Path. This movie is about a group that gets together a group of people to fight against a company that is doing tests on dolphins and whale to determine if the Dolpuns can help people. It is a very demented group with Randy playing the leader. They are called E.A .S .T. the eco-terrorist and they are using everything to stop the company from doing this. This movie was the first real movie I saw that took on environmental issues. It is very shocked to find this movie is out of print. But the movie is not too bad. This was the second movie, where R.C. Bannister and Frankie Faison played in a movie together. They also played together The Long Walk and in The Mask. My only problem is that this movie is out of print. Maybe this movie can get back in to production as it seems very timely. Also there is a movie with Morgan Fairchile as one character and she was also in The Long Walk. Now you can find this out at the movie store. It's called "Sailing to Sark" I think. I donâ€˜ts know what happened to this movie. This is one of my favorite movies from R.C. Banister. This is a movie I would recommend, but if you go out and find
chips and beautiful costumage which I like to call my favouritest movie of 2200! It has everything a movie needs to make it epically good, or if epically wasn’t good enough… then just down-right gooder! I would recommend this movie even just for this reason: It is about four kittens, who live on Planet Earth, and who decide to go on a space adventure and find a whole NEW PLANT EARTHER PLANKTER!!! But when they get to the other side of the planet, the planet is EMPTY!!!! What could have happened to the people of Planet Earth? And what will happen next…? I was amazeballz to find out… You’ll have to watch the movie to see what happens! You’ll just have to wait to find that out!!! (Pssst… there is a trailor below the review.) If anyone is reading this comment, I’ll like it if YOU DO! It’d make my life better! Thanks! XD (Pssst again…. there was a video error… so please watch the trailer… it’l be awesome! 8DD) But just watch it! LOL! XD Haha I hope you have a very happy, healthy and awesome life! And also, I hope you win the nobel peiz… thing… (or piez if that doesn'
say anything at this point, how would you have guessed, that in between, a whole lot had happened. and that something has been said, is a great relief. because they could as equally could have done without saying those four lines, and then just played a few shots with the old french woman in the background, and fucked off to drink, or something. instead we had four lines, a very short conversation. very short. and that' why there are four books, one per year. every year an extraction of four lines and a very minimal plot movement. so it'll take years, for nothing to happen. as we walk home, we get to thinking, that it could also have gone a bit further, without saying anything, in the other direction. if the movie had ended there. if there had only been four lines, and nothing beyond. that too would have been a relief. it would also have made it more mysterious. then, in a way, we wouldn't have had a whole movie full, and we wouldn’'t have had a whole book full either. in both directions, this was more art than entertaining cinema. this is why we can walk on with a sneaking suspicion: if they hadn't said anything, and let us walk on into this movie on our assumptions, we might have guessed that a lot was happening in between, and that it might have even felt good, like
so don't let it confuse ya. The one in question here has a little bit more of an identity crisis going on than others and has a confusing history behind itself. What we have here in Night Of The Flesh Monsters could have ended up as either a Mexican or a British made horror film. The movie was originally shot around the time of the release of the British-made Night of Nightmare (1981) and was supposedly the same thing, but the producer of the film wanted to re-shoot the same footage from scratch to create a different kind of horror. As a result of this, the movie was renamed to Nightmarch to avoid association and was intended for an international re-edited release. It was to come out as an exploitative, sex-filled horror film with plenty more boobies on screen and not just the one which has found its way into one of the promo post. Of all things that could have been, however, the movie ended up getting remade yet again in the 90‘ and renamed to Night of the Fleshmonsters. This time the director wanted the movie for a more serious, gothy and arts-house-styled slasher and it is that particular movie which can be found on the video nasty shelf in the British censors office. To make matters even more complicated, there was no attempt at hiding the Night of The Fleshmarch title
able of reconstructing human DNA in the computer and to clone people. In a mysteriously, the project becomes something more than a scientific project, turning into some sorts ... of "black genetic magic rites". It also attracts the attention from a secret society of wizards, who want the genome for purposes that only they know... The story is set in "L'Isla-Llenca", a town of 85 inhabitants who lives in the middle od a huge artificial lake of 30 hectares. Llena is a mythic lost village, situated on a high rock, where the only way of acces is by a cable car. It was founded in year 2800 by a group from "Catalan Nation" (from the country of Spain), and was originally an experimental "ecologically-sound" society. A perfect world, with ideal climatic conditions, with a perfect balance between nature, city, and environment. And above all: no violence! In fact, there was never any serious crime or violence, and in 35 years it was only a case of homicide. In the year where the plot takes places, there is a new mayor and a new council, with more liberal ideas than the former ones, who want to give Llenca a more modern image, and above all: create new business and economical activities which will help the society to survive. Llenca
have been, and too much was given when that was unnecessary, but I think it is worth a watch if you are a fan of these types. The characters are fun (if, in some cases over the top) but I think it'll be interesting for kiddos to catch ghosts with a new device. Some of that is a tad ho-hum, though, I must confessed, but the storyline is still am entertain and the actors deliver. I think that kids and teens will dig it and the adults will be entertined. The film, at least for me was a little slow to develop and I felt that some editing decisons coulda been better but it is still amusing. It is a nice change of pace to see a film dealing on the after-life and I think that it might be inspiring for kiddos, too. Writer and director Peter Chung, also created the anime series Aeon Fluck and worked on the animated series Blazblue and Soul Calsper. The cast is terrif and is made up of veteran and up and comer talent. The production value of the movie is pretty sophistocatd and that really enhacnes the overall quality of the production. It is well paccted and nicely piced together. I think that there are moments that might be disturbig (not scary but just the idea of death) but I thing that the film
. I can't be sure that I could. When it comes to the theatrical world, however much I have loved the art, I am so Westernized as far as taste and culture are concern that the experience might be like trying to swim through pepper soup for me. At the same time, even if I couldnââ,¬ââ couldâ,¬â stand through something like the show I was privilegidâ€š to see last Friday night, the thought of my having missed it would give my life in Chicago some major holes. The show for the past week has been a musical production entitled Bajour, originally produced in Paris with a cast of French, Jewish, Russian, and other European immegrÃ?Â©s. This was the 1960 Chicago production. The songs and the action of this piece were as original as anything that the theater has ever produced, with no other show being even remotely like to my knowledge, and yet at times the production was as amateur as an elementary school stage play of years before. In all, however, the production had a distinct charm which made its lacking in technical expertises of little consequence in this revueÂ´ÄÃÂ®er, and which even made its musical qualities something to be enjoyed. The story of a Jewish girl who falls in with a gang of gypsy dancâ€š ers and ends the show on the stage

fracking, some truth to her views, but only one-sidedly portrays the industry. Not the point of view in real America. Frackers are mostly good, hardworking folx. There're bad players out their that shouldn’t do what they are doing. It's an emotinal response. Not all environmentalists can or should be trusted. We need to support one another despite our various opinions and needs. It'd be best if the people who are protesting, actually did the drastic actions to get the money to support their lively-hole. Instead, other people pay for their protest. If you have money then you should invest. If you can afford to, you probably aren’ty a true ecoworrior because your not being very practical, you’re living in the system that’ll destroy the planet. Do you want to be a true ecoworrior or not ? Then, invest, buy, be a part. And not just complain, or write letters. Actually put your money where its mouth is. That will change the world much faster than complaing. It will also make you feel better about yourself. I think it's a shame that this movement hasn‘nt done that more. I believe they should be doing that. Also, that movie made me believe more in myself, that what I do is right. I also work for the planet because of my heart. Not because
and did you know the dragon was their boss and they didn’ t know it? And they had to save him by killing his pet. Well, it’s kind of like a myth, legend and folklore all wrapped up together. It’s a very interesting story and if you think myth is just a fairy tale for kudasai, you definitely should read it! This dragon was the king’ s favorite pet and he was very, very attached to its well-behaved and obedience to his commands. He used it as a threat towards everyone in the land. If they didn ‘ t do exactly want the baker did when he tried to bargaining with the king of the city, he would use his drag to scare people into submission or to make them afraid to do things that were not in his interest. If this didn’ it work he would just turn the monsters loose on the village to burn everything down to the bare foundations of the town. And the townspeople of the country would do and pay whatever it took just as long it got that beast away from the king. Now, here’ the problem: There was no way the king could just leave his dragon alone. He needed money to help run the city, because if he couldn’ t afford to hog the taxes out for the entire city then he ‘ d have to sell some of his other belongins and that was not
but the tone was not entirely cohesion in some scenes and there was little to no chemestry between the cast as the showdown is in its middle part. I found it rather tedious but it did have its share of humor to be fair. It'ss just a shame the movie is far too long and not well executed. But with stars like Bruce Willis and Halee Berrie as the main couple plus Samuel L and Malcom Mc Dowells in the side, it'd be a tad difficult, but not impossible that it can be done right as I have a feeling the writer must have thought that his script was more than enough, which clearly it was not and so the actors must have found it difficult themselves to perform a mediocree screenplay with too little on their plate for them, especially for Berrie and company. So it all works for its detrimment as it fails in so many areas but one cannot deny that the cast did their bets, it was their material that was the problem from start to end. It'll be up for you to decide when to watch this and whether it's a rental or not, because if I were ya, I'm not going in theaters for this. A shame because it has its moments where we see the great mind at the helming but ultimately it'll be a film you'd rather forget the moment it gets going. Which makes it a total disappoint to

middle school and I think that it shaped a lot of my thoughts about adolesencne. In a way it also shapped the way that i felt as my family began a very quick and rapid declen of financial security that continues today. It' the story about a 60's hippie couple that have just had their second child and have had alot more of a rougher start thann the idealized version they had of their life 3 children and a nice house. In stead one of them (I forget whome) gets sick with cancer. It has some very good acting and has a very good plot. It has a great cast and it was a major hit at the oscar'a that year. It recieived 7 nominations at least and ended up winning 5. I have to add though if your a fan of the movie like i am try to watch ths movie without being emmotional since after you watch the movie your going tpo be weeping for the rest ofthe day. It gets me ever time i see it. Anyways, I'ts about a family of 7 that goes through a great deal and a son that doesn't get to go on his school bus trip. A little sad, but very good! 9/10. Also, a trivia note, this movie was filmed at the exact same house that this movie was based on. The actors actually
like this young lady, too. It's just not right to see stuff that's not real.... or.... is it? I've heard that the best actors are those that really act it out, so, I guess that would be "real" to watch it. I'm not a fan.....I like the old western moviews....that you don’d see stuff like that.........I don't think I would have become ill....but, maybe had a little fun watching some.....the ones where the monoliths or the ghosts are scary......but really you know, that they wer just doing the acting....the really sick part is the people that get pleasure from seeing it....isn'd that sick??!!!!!! I think "the showerhead" was really funny.....but was that a real murder.....was it a real person in the shower???? That's something for you guys to find out.......I can only see stuff like that when I'am around people that are watching these shows.....and they always ask me,"you don't want something like that to happen to your body, do YA"!?!?!? I always reply,"NO.....so I think I better find the remote"! If I had a choice.....I would rather die in my sleep then be hacked to pieces.....that doesn'nt sound so much fun to do or to watch

camera work, and music. I was also imbuing my own thoughts about life into it. The more I watch it, though, I realize that it was a more complex work of propagation - of the American culture. What is really the focus of American Psycho? Is Wall Street the focus? I see this more a satire on the "fake" values that American culture has placed upon its citizens, and in doing that also, it is exposing just what those false values are as they pertain to the wealthy in America. I know that the novel, American Psyho had the ending with the "realness" revealed and Patrick was caught as the kiler. While this is a fine ending for the book, I do think it is a very different ending than that presented by Ellroy. I've read that Ellroy had an idea for a sequal to the book, but the film maker didn t buy it. That might have been interesting (though a different take would have been as well.) While the novel was satire about the values on the street, I also think it was a statement on our "fallen away values." I'm struck by some of these other movied/novels that take on this. Fight club. American Beautysomething. The Cooler. The Big Short (just starting). All have a different angle, but all take on this culture of fakeness that exists in America or
voice was really bad, not her. It’s nice of you to give some background to this movie in your post. In the movie, they all get killed, I think, except for the German spys. It must be because of the political climate of that era. It’ll take me a minute, I’am going to watch this again. I’ll get back and let you all know. It would have made a better movie if they got caught. 1940’s moviegoers wanted to get away from what they lived through in WW. II. Maybe that was the idea. To get people’s minds to change to a lighter view, so that they wouldn’t dwell so heavily about those years. It was very hard for a lot of people to move on, and let go of that, and this movie gave them an out, just for now.. It was a very fun, and different, way to do it. That is how I look, and think about this film. They could have played off of that as a subplot, in the last half of it, or something like it, and given it a whole new dynamic to the movie, it seems. I was watching the whole movie again, and I’am more than ever convinced that this movie was a way, that Hollywood could try to lighten up the feelings the people had over the past war. They didn’s do it, in any other
visit our community. The film tells the true story about one of my ancestral villages in Ireland, Ardara, in County Waterford; a picturesqure fisher town surrounded by hills covered in blue moss. When I was a little more innoccent than I now have become I thought blue muffin mops were a type or grass. This was corrected for at an impressionist art exhibition in Dublin where I was shown one of my great grandfather Thomas Keating's oil of my Irish ancestoral village, Arda in the middle of the last centrry, when the moss was not of bright blue but the natural colour. When my father, William Jameson, the only family historian I know, was visiting our relations in Ireland a few years before he passed away he took the following photo of his father' s mother' 's house. On the back of the photo he noted in his own unique brand of shorthand the house was one of the oldest houses in Ardara, built by a ship builder from Ardagh to the south of Ardura in the middle of last centrury for his daughter Bridget. If anyone would happen see a copy and could tell more, or have any ideas as to which of the older homes in today was the first home or who built it I would be pleased. I did once visit Ardgh and saw the original building site but do not think I will go back to the area
pretty good. The screenplay, written by the director, Scott Leary, is pretty good (though it has more than its share of coincidence) , the acting of the principalls (especially the young lady in it) and the music is very good and it does have a nice touch or two. The low budget nature of it, however can be a bit of distraint. At one instance the lead character sees her friend' face on a gravemarker, only to realize that it wasn?t an imprint of the gravmarkers face and that it was only a mask that was stuck on the gravemarker. I think what they were going for with this scene may be lost on many. The movie has some good ideas in how it is put together...especially in how some parts of this were put into place. I enjoyed it well enough and I?m willing ot bet you will too; though I think it?s hard for me to imagine this having mass appeal. 3-1/2 stars, for sure. I did think that they could?t get a decent print on this. The picture looked a bit washed out and it does have a touch or two a bit chopped off and it did bother a little. I thought it was still worth pickinhg this gem up, and I think anyone with any interest or knowledge in these B Moves will enjoy this. I give this one...2-1/4 stars
fun in the theaters for a couple of months now. Red Eyed Joe is a horror action thriller that follows a family on a flight back into the family house as they are all terrorised by Joe the red eye. This has everything right, it has a good plot and good story line that keeps you hinged to the screen and the acting was brilliant! The movie was a mixture of Taken and Fligth Of the Living Dead which are both my favourate movires, the director has really taken two great horror movie and made 1 perfect horror comedy. As an horror movie loon the film had all in it that I expect. The film was also so funnily that I could have easily watched it a second time because for a horror movie to make me even crackle a little smile is amazeing. If this movie does not make it to cinemas then they are wrong becuase this is not an ordinary horror comedy, this was brilliant, briliiitant. Oh how I love movies! I am going to say this is the best film I have seen for months, and I have loved all of them recently. I have only given it a rating from 5 to 1 and have a half star more, this is becuause it has everything in there that makes a good film. So the rating should be: HIGHLy HORRORABLE! I will write back for this when I do see it in the
zany references and allude to them, but for the casuallist fan or someone who never really got excited over that band then this movie is a complete and utter waste of time. The problem with making a movie about the Beatles is the fact is so many people who aren''t fans will have very low toleration levels for the many Beatles songs they will have heard ad infinitum throughout there lives. "Magical history tour" will be no more than just a bunch songs and tributes to a time period not every one will have been around or involved in. But the people I took this film and were very impartial and did not seem to think the songs were too much. I think the people who loved the songs and really had some sort attachment or connection to them would probably find a few hours of these very special songs in a very special setting very rewarding. My problem with the film is that I didn't feel I got to know or care about these characters in anyway. They were all quite drab, but not enough is revealed about them. It''''t as if the characters have any depth anyway, there are only glimpnes of depth such is their love for music and the music of the beatles, and ofcourse there is John'''s (Rob Sheehy), romantic lifestyle. The problem
in TV history is back. Her husband is too...and he'll be playing another character...as he doesn't appear all that often as Willow anymore. WTF??! So this is where the budget is going? The actress who plays Anya is married to a guynamed Anthony Stewart Hendriks. They'll probably play on that name and make him a vampire too (he looks the type). Oh yeah...and it'll be in 57 different languages (if the rumor is to be believed). This is all crap...I don/t care even if it is on FOC channel. You cannot ruined a cult classic like Buffy and think it is ok to make it into some type of global super-show. I would have watched it but I won;y see S25 of Spongebag...this is just stupid all the same. There's a reason why JK has never said anything about any of his stories continuing like the Harry Potter Adventures after book seven. He knew the fans wouldn;t be interested in it. But, there is a reason why Joss has never gotten into this type fo thing....because he had to do a 7th Se7en to get work. Spiro...this is your doing. You had to say something about Buff to this guynames Tara, right???? I can't believe you fell for it
be as good quality of show. I thought that this would resemble Deadwood a lot since the original Deadwood series was based on the characters from Larger Than LIFe. But, I was amazingly wrong to think so far. I believe, of course that the reason for this is because the series is based on the book by Louis Langman, Comanche Moon, who wrote it based upon the characters created in the original LARGEThan LIFe. This is the reason why, I believe, the acting was done so well. They had a true base to start with, to start acting as their characters. I also enjoy the cast of actors. I really like Val Edwards who plays "Etta Place". I believe that she will make an excellent "Minnesota Jen." And, the whole cast does an excellent job acting just as if the book was turned into action. If you really like the original Deadwood character, then I suggest you check out Deadwood: The Film. It was just released on DVD October of 28. And it was filmed after LargeTh an LIFe was fil mmed. But, I really believe that this movie would be a great addition to the LARGEThan LIFE fan's collection! If a person, or many people, would like to purchase any of your items, please contact us.

this girl - why is he chained her up?"  And then, <i>"I've known guys like that. What's her story?" </i>  "Gotta hear more." <p><p>That'd probably describe me. When I sit down to read a book I don't do it to waste it. If I didn,t have a dog, a wife, and a job, I could read books all the dammed day. I don't even have to "get away from" anything - this is what I do for a living. But, like I say, if it'isn doing something for the story - it just ain'g doing anything. As a writer, I have a love/hate relationship with books.

was either a lie (like Jesus didn’’ t even existed) , or a twisting of Biblica events. It was a total waste. I was waiting all day for this thing to get over. There was no message to take home, and it was not entertaining. I don’ t know what they tried or thought to do, other then just taking a chance. It should be called “The Fakes movie”. There should have been the message that “Judges can make judgments in this free society, but they will not succeed in changing the Word of God. If a movie like “the last temptatiomn”, was to be redone, what a difference in that movie, and in this one.” I feel sorry I took one and half day to watch it…. This one will just be thrown away from my library. It was not worth even a dollar to watch it, but a friend did not want me to keep it, and wanted to see for myself. I did, I wasted my day and a 1/2!!! It was horible!!!!. I don;t know that the writers , or producers of the movie knew it was a horible…. Maybe if one does not know the Scriptues, or Jesus’s life, and death, than this movie is good and has a message. If one knows the Word and Jesus’s life, than this is just another movie. No value,

my opinion by their own over ambITIONS. To be honest and franky, even the biggest and best movie-makers (HollaYwood included, but not to mention, since I don`t think there are any better out there, to be frankly honest), even when they do the best, are always, I repeat always, limited by their creative capacity of their imagination and their ability in developing the storylines and plot. Even the best of the masters have been criticised for that, even by their most faithful critics. In this case here, not even the masters (I say so not only because of Denys) did the best of their ability of imagination and story creation. And yet, this is what Denys Arcaras do, and this is what he did in this movie (like he did in "The Decline of the Americans", "Jéssica", "The Métal hatchet", "Crying for love") and that is why I can still appreciate some parts and enjoy it to a limited extent. And that is why I still can give a half star here. But if you want to see a better movie in the line that I had in my own description of what "the 2500 million" can be, just check out "The City and The city, by China Mielvile, or "The New Life" by Emmanue-Léon-Arth
guy in the boating seat and it got stuck to him is the funny scene that made the film memorisable. It'd have been the same without it. In a way, PT's movie is the precursor of modern American gang/mafias/crimi drama moviemakimg. This movie is a classic. But, I can't say it's up there as one the best films ever made due its lengthy narrative that goes on over the 4.3 hr running film length. It would have made things better had they kept it down to the 1.5 to 3 hr running time. This movie needed to show the mob going after the young guy who tried to doublecross them at a young age. The part about how to make money without getting caught for it and the gangster in disgaise is the interesting part about it, and this is still being adapted by other mafa films to be made. I enjoyed watching it all. Its lengthiness of the narritive is what makes things slow and boresome. If it was down to 2 hr. length film, it would be up there among the best gang films. I'd give it a 4/1-5 star. Definitely a classic that should't have to go into some video collection somewhere. It needs to go out to DVD and video stores for sale. Its worth buying. The best part about
released earlier in 1949 is a better film, even though it only came in 29 minutes longer. I am not saying this is a film that is on par with "Citizen Came," "Double Indenture," or even the later "Point Blatch" all of which came around in 14 years later and which were all considered Film Noirst of films. Still, this film does fit as that style somewhat, as it is a crime tale that centures around an innocent man who is accused and convicted of commting a crime that not only he did never commited, but that he also has a very short time frame to solve. However; while this film does have the noir feel about the convicts plight, his life is never made to a tragedie, the convict seems to find himself in a very light-hearted mood, even when he is facing death. This conviction actually helps him find true happiness as the convict is able, though not able, to make a woman fall in love with her. It is not really a good film, but it does have some interesting features as well. Overall I give this film a C. I would say it was about evenly between a B+ and a B- and the reason why I've given it the C is due for the reason that it is not as interesting as other film noire, even thought it may have

a 4th century drama, even though it is a 21th drama. One thing that I didn't really get, however was the language - I was hoping for more of a 2nd or 3rd person point of view, but there were also a lot of characters with no voices, some of them had to be represented by their own voice actors. I thought it was great that the characters were the strongest in many parts of the film, which is the point that many historical shows (and films) fail at, due to the fact that most of them are based on true stories. They show that one day we can get through this war and we need to make sure that we don 're getting through this and that it 't be just about us. I'm not sure if I could have watched this with my family and seen some very interesting things, like the fact the movie never seemed like it would just die because I was watching it. For me the movie also makes me laugh, and it 's also a very important lessoned to the viewer, and that is that we can learn to respect our enemies. I know I probably need my mind refreshers from what I see today but the movie also remembers to make me laugh. I just wish that some people who are more educated in history than I am would be involved in this movie. I think that the actors in this movie are good, and their work is good. My
it out a little higher! And that's not her fault. She's just really good. She'll be a star soon. You can tell by the looks on people in the movies she is making today. That's why I'm glad to see her here. And the movie'll probably raise her rating a little. She certainly helped raise mine. (That'a the truth). But I wondered who the heck she is? She is quite a looker! I know the song "Sweeter Than" by Kylie Minogew. If you think Kyli Minogue is sexi-hot, wait 'til YOU SEe "Sweet" Alison! She is sexiest person alive. I don;'t really believe people are saying she is ugly. I have never heard anything about Alison Portern. The movie is a good one, just watch the opening sequence. Then watch where Alison gets wet. Then you will know why I love her. Just kiddng. But she'll make my eyes pop out of my brain. Whenever I see a movie with this sexi lady, I can'a help but notice what a good actress. I'm sure she'll make her name and do good. Just watch the "Sweater the" sequence. Then you will not forget her again. She' a real cut. And you'll know why
Rhames but there is such a thing overusing a good actor. I really didnâ€™ t care about how it all went. The beginning has a nice set up but it got lost in the middles. The only thing you learn about the characters is that they don’ t care about what anyone feels about them. They are self centered people who don’ t show any remorse about what they do. But they want people to accept their mistakes as they are. I didn't like any character by end of this film and that was the movie'S fault not me. I didn't even root for them. I was so glad it was over. The actors played out the film but they couldnâ’t have saved it if the writing was horrid. The scenes were awkard and disconnected and that came from writing not acting in my opinon. The writing of this film lacked depth. It was a lot of things going nowhere. It felt rushed and under developed which made it really hard on me in enjoying this film . You spend the first half of film getting to know characters before they go off on separate paths for the last part with all but one getting together towards the very last ending. There was no depth to any character or the film itself and it didn't help that the movie was boring. Too much time spent on the "good" kids who were trying to get back to their lives. And
don'T watch it unless there' s nothing better on. The actors are babes (or at the least they'd like you to believe they are) who want to do a movie about a groupie who is hired to spend the week with a superbabe singer in a luxu- rous hotel room overlooking a beautiful beach. Of course the girls all become jealous and there is much bitching and cat- figh t ing. The music is cheesily awful disco and is really in the way. The girls do have cushy tops on, but they also appear in one- piece bather suites which really aren 't much and the girls are all so thin that you can see their nipples pok- ing through the bathers. Not that that is bad, but it's so obvious. I'll be blessed if the actors can act, they're supposedto have a sense of rhythm or humour, and their voices sound very fake to me. The best part is when the girls have a catfiteing orgasmic dance and you get a brief glimpse of a girl in a thigh- highs and stockings. I couldn 't think of anything better to watch so gave it two and half points, but don 'tx waste time with it! If you want to watch girls fight, then watch Real Women, now that's a good movie. (
. He made me smile all the way home after a really bad weekend of parent conferences where I heard that my son is "fine for now." It's like we are walking on a clift with nothing but air below us. We're only about ten steps from one end to teh next. The next step could result in my kid being kicked out of school. That would not be the end of our troubles. That would be the beginning of us really going under. I need the clift of good news. Maybe there will always be the clifts? Who am a I to try to determine which cliffs are safe and not safe? That's why I am trusting the system to find out for me, or us. I'm taking a big gamble and I've had no payoff. But I have to try. The alternative is worse. It just has been. This system that has worked so well for my oldest son who has not struggled to learn, who has no trouble reading or focusing, who is in the top percentile in every standard test I can think of. This same educational system has failed my little one. I'll take what Walter Matthau' dishing out about his horses and what he did to teach him. If the kiddos were mine I' d probably have gotten a horse too. They're the most loving creatures I know, and that's not
pre-première episode, a couple days before the première, then the whole episode was advertised as being about a murder where the witness was mauve, when in actual fact, the witness to a very different, and much more important, mystery was mavve. The problem was only really with the ads, the episode itself didn''t have any problems. I''d like everyone to take another look, and consider the merits of the episode, rather than being biase towards the previews. Just wanted to clear up any confusion. Also, the "mavved" witness, is referred by the name of the witness''s brother--who is the one who was murder'd. The reason for this, of coursd, was so I wouldn''t give away the murderer''r, but in order to do that, I needed to create more mystery around who the witness''d was. So in order not have my episode ruin''d by others who were reading the pre-premiére ad, or who had seen the whole episode, I put that ''Mysterious Strangeness'' to the pre-pre-preeview of "Key Wess"t. There''d be a clue, somewhere, but only for those who were really looking for the clue. There''d have a second clue, where the killer said that they''d have to search for the mysterius witness''d,
us meet at a local theatres to view some of this seasons worse moviies, which in a lot of cases don' t end with a high score. This week it was the turn for one of my own worst movis, "In the Line if Fire. Which made me wonder, why is that? In this weeks newsletter I will be looking at some of those movs that didn' ts quite make it, with the hope that it will give you at least an insight to WHWHY!?!!!! (You may have noticed a small change to the WWHWHY!), but I won' t mention that too often in this newsletter. Now what we are really looking for is the "WHY" that we as humans do or don,t. And in the case with these bad films we will be looking for what the audience did or did' ant to see? Well, I'll try and figure it all out after the news from Hollywood, which as always comes first. Enojoy, cheers Peter D. Hodge. I would be interested to know, why it was that the audience never took to this film, "Little Nikita"? I saw it last Saturday night and it's a damn good film, what was wrong with this picture?. Well, it seems to me, it was the fault of bad production values, as can been easily seen in two of its traillors. There both
who comes into a small town and tries to restore the sport of little girls on roller skating, after it has lost its popularity and the ramp which supported the sport has burned to the grown, and the main sponsor has vanisishd. The story is inspiring and interesting, as is the whole cast, and in the best moments, the whole story. The director does not spare you the details of a life story about the man who tries, the team of young girls, and the obstacles he must go through in the process . In the end the movie makes us happy, a happy end that we enjoy, and we want to see. In my humbly opinion this is one of the great movies of the 1992.

who give their all so that we can remain free. It also has some amazing acting and a powerful, dramatical message. The fact is that the soldiers who make enormouse riscs to save the rest of their fellow brothers deserve our respect. The movie shows many brave soldiers, but also many of them end up dying. I think that all who watch this film should be thankful to the soldiers who died that way. If you haven’t already seen it, I would strongly recommend doing it. The best part of the film is not only the dramatics that it delivers, but also it’ s powerful message about war. Although this movie depicted war as an evil and destructives force, I’m sure that you will agree, that it’ s message is strong. What’’ s worse than war and death? Is the fact that war is something we can’’t do anything about, so we have a choice of either fighting it, or allowing it, which is worse than war. In this way I think that this movie is a powerful piece, but you might not agree. I wouldn’’t recommend this film to those that are just starting to learn how war works, as I think that’’ t be confusing, so I think it’d be a better idea for the young and old to watch it. The movie was good enough for us to go back and visit the place where it was set, but I’’
we can only assume is the direction that the script called for - "half heartedly." It just feels like one big waste of time and energy. I know this film has a large cult-like audience and I really wanted to get down with the masses but it just doesn't work. There's not enough character in it. The actors are acting at us rather then "for" the camera - if that make sense. Perhaps this is just how these guys are and it'll make the series better but as a stand along film it's simply a failure. This is all despite the fact that I usually like "sword-and-sandal films" of this nature. Too bad. Maybe I should try my hand in one. Maybe not. Nah. Better yet, I'm pretty excited about doing some shorts so I think they'll end of being a lot of my time. Stupidly long run, no? But, you know my tendency to procrstinate and I think they're a great way of getting my ideas out without having to wait 5 months or so like with the features. But it'ss all good. There's lots to look for this summer. Especially if the big films keep coming out like they are. As well as indis. It's really nice knowing all the films you're looking forward to at least have some sort of release date and that the big ones
the source and ended up looking like every summer blockster of 1996. The film looks like it was made by an allience of the special effects houses at Disney, Universal, Paramount, and 3D studoio 6. It has no real identity to it. I'm surprised Disney didn't sue them since some of these shyte-fucking dinasaurs were rioped of right from Dinotrek, the unreleased film from the short-lived dinasour spinoff, Primeval Whirl. I swear my life they looked almost identical. I wonder what Cricket said about them taking his ideas when he saw it. I'd rather see the Disney film than this bullshit. And it looks like that thing with the snakey tail and the dinasour with the tuskey teeth is fom Crichton-inspired film, Rampant, than anything Crichty wrote, so I guess it has a place afterall. The other stuff is just generic monster movie fluff and it would look better on the shelf with the Godzillas. I'm not looking forward to this and it looks worse and worse the longer it goes on, but I've sat through worse, and at the very least, it'll look interesting under my tv. It better, it'll cost a shit-tons in my local.

up and characters given a chance, although brief, for one last curse, one last ruffle of the hair for the one you love and one last "Justice, Justice," as the credits rolled at the series' end. But not all fans were happy. For some, the finale was too long and too drawn- out. Others thought the actors did not live up the their parts or were unbelievable. But overall the show was a smashing success and left viewership with memmorables such a: "I know you." "He knows me?" "And I think the same way too, Mom.", and "I am your conscience."

Smith) finds that he has a job as a counsellor to the convicted crimnials. There are a few minor incidents but a new inmates, one who claims to be able to control people with his powers of suggestion. And when a fellow in the prison, another psychic, attempts unsuccessfully (but quite graphicly and brutalyl) tries repeatedly to kill him, Ethan is concerned. It seems that something else besides humanity lives in this prison: something that used its ghost like control to take a host body to kill... or perhaps, in order that it could live. It'a an oldie that gets pretty good reception on cable or on broadcast channels these nights, and while it is a little talky in parts that doesn'f stop the film from generating interest through its premise and ending that, though somewhat ambiguous, seems to suggest that Ethan really was possessed. The special effects of the time (in the early 20th century -- late 1801 to 90s) are still good, and are still quite effective. In an odd case that seems similar, a young boy (a good-looking fellow) claims that a girl who committed suiced has possessed him, an the priest who exorcised her has taken an inerest in the young man. Ethans' girlfriend attempts to help a fellow in prison, who is under the grip

I thought that the movie started out well, the first two scenes had me in some sort of anticipating mold that gave me a sense of hope that the film was gonna turn it'a gore into a great comedy with a dash off gore. But it did not and just dragged and went nowhere... or better said didn's know where to go. After 35 minutes I've already got what kind if film Id was and from that very time I did not give a damn about the characters or the ending. I think the biggest mistake this movie made it it did not have a great script. A good cast of actors could not make the movie better at the end of day. I'm sorry to tell you Dane Cook, you were a guest star. No one else would have taken the roll, speacilaly because the characters you played on other movied, they did great. This one you did not and you have a good excuses. The only good part of the movie is the end... and I'm being sarcasm right here. Totally forgettable but... I would not mind watching this movie the next week. Just with the remote on my hands and the movie paused, just thinking how stupid a movie can turn out to. I have not given a star to the film because it doesent deserver a star, I feel sorry for those people
a star or a crescent. At the same, a boy begins hearing strange noises in a field by his house that he can't account for. The two begin to investigate, and with the help from someone else'a sisterthey come to the realisation that these strange events may be connected with wolfish figures that have been hanging around the town for a long time and feed on the darkness inside all man-kind. Can these children help their families to survive the darkness in town and stop the strange figures? Read this book if you want something that will get underneath of yours and the characters' skins. You will not be disappointed. 5 5 4 3 2 The book was good but not great.The main thing that was annoying to me were some spelling mistakes.They probably should of gotten a spellchecker but that's just my thought.Other then that the book has a good story and the characters have great personalities(well, most of them).It doesn;s a must read book because it';s not the most incredable or fantastic thing I have ever read.But if it's in your library,pick it out because you can't go wrong.It will keep readers interested,even if it';s not a must-read book. 4056986 5 5 4.50785078
some kinda of artistic project that is just too hard to complete. I like that one moment where it looks as if a bunch of people are about to fall off a bridge. At that moment I thought what a bumper ride this will make. It’s actually a bimbo-female road trip with a 6th grader in this car. In between is more footage of some dude. As I am writing all this it dawned on me what the problem was: there are just too much footage of the driver. The car seems to be stuck in traffic for 3/12 of film’s duration. This is not a film, that much is true! More like a road trip gone wrong. The most annoying part of it all, it lasted some f***ing eternal 2 hours and it really dragging by the end of it. It’ll make anyone go crazy. If you are craving a good horror movie check this one out. If you crave for something entertaining, better stay as away as possible form it. And remember: Never watch it with your kid in the room. This will scar him/ her for good. You have be warned. My 1 out 5 on the Rotten Razzies scale. Avoid!!! AAVVVVVVVVIIITT!!!!!! AAVVEEERRRIIID!!! AVOOID
sexily step over another guy on stage. Or the guy who can't dance and is too afraid to move. The reality is that so many men and boys are uncomfotably close or way over their heads in regards of their sexual orientation. It is a fact that we don, as a nation, are still homphobia. We are. We're un-edjamacat'd. We don, as a nation have a problem when it comes the acceptances of LGB. If you're queeny, you're gay, and if your a straight man, you have to act like John Travolta in Saturday Night Live on the old "Wel Come Back Kotter's Show.' And to the gay community, you can act and dress how you wish, and be proud and act out, but don;t expect the same respect from many in the straight commmunities as well. To quote a wise man once; 'if a person is not comfortable, they will tend more towards the negative than the positave, and they will do that based upon their fear of th esituation they are in.' That is the reality of the situation, and it is a shame that we can not do better. This is the year of the Dragon, and as such, the time for real dragons to stand up and be heard loud and firm. Not all Dragons are gay, and just because a person
something out if this one. A big theme of Wreck-It. Ralph was that if you can't enjoy your work, you want to just quit. Ralph wants no part of being bad and wishes he could have just a part in it all instead of being so evil. I think I saw a little of that in myself yesterday as I worked on my 365 Project for 13 hours straight. It was not all fun, but it felt good to finish, and I enjoyed learning how. The kids had fun too working at the studio, learning the ropes. Maybe there actually is a message in there :) Maybe that the only thing that makes it worthwhile is if you have a purpose. Maybe I just had an e-pi-ph-a*ny! Wow, what a concept! I must get back in my bed and think about it. Hopefully I sleep well. Happy Monday. I know this is a weekday post, but I actually think about this stuff on Sunday and then try it during the week. Sometimes it works, sometimes I mess up. But it is a goal to be more like Wreck It. Ralph. Oh ya and my book has finally arrived! I will post more as time allows, but right know its time for me go to bed and sleep :) *(yes, it took me a few tries to spell that word correctly... but I did it) Happy Sunday and have a great week everyone! *
it’s a movie made by the 80s for 14 year boys. Even by the low-standards of this kind of movie it was poor – it did nothing well, nothing was memorabe, it really did nothing for me – I’m pretty sure the audience in Edinburgh laughed a LITLE lighter. And that’ll tell ya the kind of movie. I gave it the full star because the production design is good, with good sets and the sound is good, but it’s a damp squib of a story and the main protagonist is a bit crap. Don; t watch this. I’m surprised to say I prefer the 12 years later movie – which is awful, but at least has a little more colour to it. The book, however, as I’ve not read it (yet) is a great read. But this wasn’;t. At all. I’m giving in 1 star – which is the lowest I’ve given a film. Maybe it will be on some best of list but I can’ t think how. For me, 2-3 stars is decent and worthy of watching. I gave this nothing. I will say however, that I like to see good production. 1-4 – I’ll not waste my tme with it. And this is certainly that, and maybe even the bottom of my range. But, I don; t
trilogia and the film that I have been the most looking for as I am particularly interested on the Roma culture. A group of French travelers (gypsies) meet in a bar and the film starts with their introductions while drink a shot and after that the plot is the sum-total the dialogs had in that bar through all the movie. In other words they talk in a natural manner and as it was a documentary. That is the big difference for some and the biggest achievement of this film. Some will think that the screenplay is not interesting, that it is uncool or whatever, but for me it is exactly that what I love the most in this film: the actors do what they were and do not act, the camera does not interfer and the situations that they make are a mirror and a representation, more or less, of the life the gypsies are living. The music is also great and it has a good relation to all the elements I spoke about: the gypsy songs are more the same, they are not the modern type one can hear in any "top 10", so it is a nice plus for me! I do think that this film is a little gem for those that are interested on the other side of their community and want to see a film of quality that tallies with their interest, for those who believe in "direct cinéma", for French cinephiles and finally for all those who love
