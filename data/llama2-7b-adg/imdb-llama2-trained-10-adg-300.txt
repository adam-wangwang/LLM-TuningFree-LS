. The TOLO has a more refined style of cinema. That's why I keep going there. Touching stories, in poetry, drama and even comedy have been commended in the movies like Emil and the Detectives, Summer in Berlin, Come Back, Little Sheba! and so on. WithBroken And even worse! You could say I bear a grudge towards Roman Polanski. From time to time you find there performance cinema with technical supports and technical/studies performances. You don't get Flea Market, leaving the cinema after three hours of action and fun. I'd rather sit and watchSie revise some not so great films as My Favorite Women and Hopscotch.Sometimes when you have to give your opinion about films you watch, you feel you're damned even if you don't like it. If you leave the cinema a happy man you have a bloody conscience so you'd better go to seeLife without prohibitions! (Or you have to leaveKiss Me Deadly back home!) Berlin is the city of cinema. From Rudolf Virchow straight to the Große Bleichen lie the cinema (virchow.de). Others use Silesiam Cinema Dialectics. A longer list of cinemas from the subculture scene.For films of the 1930s and the 1940sobserve the blue-black
a budget should not take anything away from its technical execution or the subtle nuances in the performances put on film for later viewing so the writer can concentrate on the above. Rhys Ifans, who is also the director, is at the top of his game. The only mistake that could have been made here is casting yourself in the leading role, but he somehow manages to integrate the idiosyncrasies of his performance with the text. He should be proud that his filmmaking debut on his character would be enough to ensure him a leading role in Roland Emmerich's 10,000 BC (read the other negative reviews that say the same). Ifans has such a striking resemblance to the writer Jonathan Strange that the casting agent should have been nominated in a category at the Academy Awards. There is not one moment of fast-or-slow motion editing that distracts unless perhaps it is the incessant video footage of the concerts and promotional clips that may confuse the uninitiated character who knows very little about modern art, as he is supposed to be. Turner and the Sea Horse deserve to be seen soon to refresh one's perspective on art as a counterculture narrative. It only scraps in the battle of moving pictures because there is a lot of nudity (uncensored, for all your pricing pleasure), violence, and other explicit adult content
is classic Sapkowski in the grey world of Ciri. There is a lot to be said and unfortunately I know the Polish language but not well enough to give a very good commentary. The performance was perfect and the general story line pulled out many favorite characters and plot lines from past novels. As a message to the author, take your sweet time and don’t rush. I will buy each book and use them while waiting with wild anticipation for the next one... Enjoy and thank you. One last note, my favorite book in the series is the last of the First Wave, Seance. I was upset that they changed the titles. I us a poquito de madrid... tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Rothkrj Well... (view spoiler)[They should have kept the titles "Holy Fools" for the first arc novel and "Wisdoms of ages" for the second arc novel... these names are very fitting for the novels and who cares what they stand for in the distant future if that happens.... Suffering stupidity is not my style. I wonder if someone can put everything together.. Tchark (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)] PS. If you’re into this. Read the Yellow Fairy book as well (SARS – short story Andrzej Sapkowski, English version) it is pretty good and more into this
Tuscia (south of Rome), anonymous wheelchair-bound man, with his eyes bandaged and hands nailed to the chair, rode atop of the title train, while the pounding chord music plays behind him. Meanwhile shots of a cute blonde dressed in vaguely Goth pop up onscreen to build up the suspense with false points of view. More pop up in these moments, including a male figure standing in some graveyard tombs and the previously-mentioned young women in the aforementioned Goth outfit, also, doorways filled with Goth tiling; It was like a Goth family picture album, 1960's style. While the pop-up shots became irritating, they conveyed Fulci's atmospheric technique towards the material, and were progressive enough to allow him to develop his title character. This is unlike films today, in which the Piranha in Japanese horror popularize the pointless discourse ahead of visual moments. I think clunky is the operative word today, plot line-wise. And Fulci’s Violence in the Case Of Psycho proves that there is no need for visuals to carry a film, if the director is up to the task. CU emerged with those early 90s extreme giallo flicks, including more crackling Fulci: The House By The Cemetery –
only a German poster. I do not want to generalize here but I imagine that the vast majority of moviegoers in other countries can hardly imagine what exactly has been shown on screen. What really happened on the bridge? The movie contrives to expose the Greek officials, in a rather bungy-bowing-and-scraping style so that one hardly is aware of the real content anymore. To any reasonable person what has been shown on Greek policy is completely shocking and enough is not visible to most people out there. But here are people who unfortunately watch television news sometimes or the German ones that remain stuck in the Kehlsteinershof och senata and hardly do anything then anything else. If they do not learn about the Greek reality, they never do. Go to Der Spiegel Media http://www.spiegel.de/video/ and you'll be enlightened. "Covered with a blanket" ... is that some sort of source for a novel the Greek version of Kehlsteinershof och senata? That would have been "Der Spiegel" or something? why indeed shouldn't?? I am sure that an important X-yard story is going on there.... again Greek from north to south, man August Dowson tracks. "Do you think I consent to anything?" I would like to enlighten Δημότικο and give the advice that you do not fool Independents for
movies often fell prey to bad voice dubbing and single digit special effects, Swamp Thing never falters and only continues to get better and better. Seriously, there's nothing remotely bad about this adaptation. I'd go so far as to say Soloman created the wisest adaptation of any comic book character ever. Unless of course we're counting the Nicolas Cage one, but I digress. Solomon gets to the core of Swampy's nature and development and puts it on a strong showing, seeing it from a kids point of view hugely coinciding with creator Len Wein's vision, as a New 52 book that only existed for a few months really should. It's also one of the few original comics to do well in whole 80s package, so props to writer Michael Reaves and artist Dan Spiegle for staying true to the source material and trying something new. It was a very solid take on a classic character. And may it marvelously rest in peace. Plus they actually printed those literal buckets of cash with the material inside. Remember those? Ah, the good times...not that I'M old...not that I'M not. Y'know what? Let's not think about this too much, okay amigo? Oh, come on ,you know you wanna. Yeah, you know, there... >.<
that made the most of its London setting - rather more so to anyone venturing out to a multiplex to find there wasn't a 3D version of Fast & Furious 6. What you got instead was Fast 6, the sixth, some might say sixth-rate, instalment in the series of cop-machine blowing Japanese truck-based movies that the global moviegoing industry somehow needs to appease. For in Idris Elba, Fast 6 has the presence and talent to animate its thin storyline about – well, it’s not clear really, or at least it wasn’t on the plane I was sitting in – dodgy machinations between cars-of-the-future and the cadres of ex-soldiers they bristle with. It’s a crappy storyline without “Knock-knock-knocking on Heathrow” or any power to dazzle, and apart from a neat Jean Claude Vandamme cameo, the actors couldn’t make me care. The action and fine-tuned gaming sense pleases, but you need more depth to the characters and their motivations (as Oddjob in Goldfinger knows only too well). Pity, because I’d dearly like to recommend Idris Elba for a career change. Think Lil’ Wayne meets Elodie Yung at Radio 1
weakest. That’s not the case here: I thought that the first Pirates of the Caribbean was one of the best movies I’ve ever seen, and the next two sequels just kept building upon that. This movie may have been a bit jumpy in some sequences, but it retained the high standard of acting and plotting that the previous three movies had and it delivered a really truly moving ending scene. Let’s delve a bit deeper. I have problems with the following customer reviews. Their constructive criticism is perfectly fair; however, I do feel there is a double standard when it comes to screenplays. A playwright who is also the screenwriter (e.g., Peter Shaffer and Mario Puzenelli, with whom I’ve worked on Broadway) knows roughly how the movie will play. This author says: “This is the bad news: it misses as much as it hits.” No screenwriter or movie critic says that about the work of such greats as F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Steinbeck, Herman Wouk, etc. If they did, it would be unfair. Furthermore, screenplay style cannot be compared to a play because there are certain things you just plain can’t do on film. Why don’t they just compare box office, say, or test scores? The second critique is “don’t care for the buildup of all the comp
of Heroes". I first-blocked that after seeing how bad this movie is. You'd think after Heroes backlash they would have made mine a little bit better, some hook. But oh well. So in this movie, Matt will die and Rebel will become evil. And PJ's dad will die also... So much for me getting my movie prop weapon, I'm afraid. Hmph. :/ And it's funny. Though it tries too hard to do that, I keep laughing within the movie, because things are so stupid in here. You know this is a Sony movie right? They all have stupid hair and apparently only could afford wardrobe that is either horribly cheap or hand-me-downs. But you just get why when you see how busted beyond repair is their whole studio. With offensive jokes tht don't go anywhere. With lines written so badly you cringe, because they're just there. It's not written badly because of story, nice idea, but it's speard out shoddily, because the writer couldn't write a decent screenplay. Just some truly awful writing. And terrible effects. Well... I saw that the makers made one main animation idea work, which was that just-before-death-echoing under the brackroaches writhing in Matt's grave. They pulled that
either strayed too far from home or exhausted the resources available on the internet. As a longtime film scholar, I never realized how much knowledge about classics has declined in a society hooked on the latest blockbuster. The websites hidden here are the salt of the earth for cinephiles who need something other than YouTube. In a time when the academy has made the study of classics seem irrelevant, and classes have been cut in one area after another, students are seeking out the information on their own. These websites and the movie savvy people who administrate these domains provide a much needed service to independent filmmaking and film scholars alike. The internet provides scholars with the hard to find reels, and students with the ability to go deeper than they are able to in a traditional classroom. With information readily available to students, professors and cinephiles alike, filmmakers can take the essence of the Golden Age of film and learn the ins and outs of technique while gleaming filmmaking inspiration along the way. We live in a world that wants instant gratification and it should be no wonder that cinephiles have turned to a world which provides the templates of movies to be remade and to master. TEP is a place where at least one can find his or her way back home to cinema of old, a place where another Dean Martin can find its place in the shadow of “
who will run the Laogang crime triad. The present incumbent looks like he's going to win, but he doesn't expect to have almost no competition among his subordinates, so he stays with an insider candidate. But his number two, Lung (Sammy Hung), isn't so happy, claiming a resounding vote total is a sign that the membership want new leadership and starts gathering support. Meanwhile, in Canada, Wong too, is laying the groundwork for an attempt to assume leadership. Things are complicated when the triad is assigned a new poll worker, Mid-Tong (Tony Leung Ka Fai). But before the poll worker can get a chance to influence the vote, he's murdered by Wong's crew, who now suspect that he was working for the triad leadership. The next day, one of the fire hall's fires is doused with gasoline and ignited, killing 15 people and a fireman, ostensibly as an example of what happens when the fire hall is run by the triads. The police ask Wong and Lung to run the fire hall until after the election, which creates double the number of rival power bases in a city already politically ripe for a change. Who will win: Lung, who's ambitious and willing to fight for it, or Wong, who's already in charge and
but Brown of Harvard is a quaint period film, more removed from current attitudes than Bad Education that we're unaccustomed to. As such then, it's successful. It's a little slow to get going, but it's certainly watchable, and compared with other 50s movies it's refreshing in its lack of sensationalism. Though yes, that's a large amount of products shown on screen. Some viewers may relate to Harry and Dinty, others may be left bemused by their pervading patriarchy. It touches briefly on symbology of power but the politics don't define the characters. And if they do it's a movies that shows Hollywood doesn't have to be inept to dredge up the respectable past, not that every audience is interested in respectable. If you're willing to slow your higher society expectations down enough you may find yourself charmed by Brown of Harvard. The simplistic directive is easy to see. Don't give up on your dreams.

Wave films. What you have here is an intelligent film about class position and the psychology of seduction. It stars one of the hottest men in French cinema, Jean-Paul Belmondo. He was a very popular star at the time. This is really his breakout role. He also directs and produced the film. Marianne (Jean Seberg) is a bubbly ice queen. Jean Stucis (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is a young bohemian painter. She is dressed in white leather jackets and high-heeled shoes. He is a dirty long-haired ne’er do well who still lives at home with mother. Jean-Paul ruthlessly pursues her, yet remains ignorant of the fact that Jean wants nothing more than to remain single and free. This is one of the best sex comedies ever devised. Its black and white cinematography is as equally beautiful as its conversations. It was one of the first New Wave films to reach international audiences in 1962. The New York Times compared its transcendental beauty, white moderate vs. black extreme: “If movies could press miracles upon the inattentive and faceless, this film would be one, shown beautifully in black and white.” You might also want to check out Eric Rohmer’s A Good Marriage, a
was impressed by how much everything was accomplished in five days. Unlike many low-budget productions, this movie seamed to have a production designer, set dresser, and an art department, among other things. The sets looked much more like what I would expect on a Hollywood production than even on some of the Hollywood movies I have seen. Overall, the sets were well designed, but there won't be many action scenes. Here the obstacle course looked like the Gingerbread Village, and the Near Death Experience Course just a step up from that, but full of fun at either level. The helicopters looked especially well designed, and the pyrotechnics show's magic looked very good. For a fantasy, it is quite violent and funny. Too bad the science lost. The continuity was intermittent, sometimes good and other times poor. Clanger was very well cast, and the supporting cast nearly as good. I got quite caught up in it. The ending worked fairly well, and the extra scenes slightly less so, but enough so that they should not be skipped. The Blu-ray's only flaws were how they had to censor the movie - just like LOSTMAN on Hulu - and that the movie only ran 80 minutes (rather than the stated 84 minutes). This is the first movie I have watched where the team had to find
made. As with many of the season 1 episodes, they didn’t share much information about the date, so it was hard to verify when they were actually made (1984 for Mongoose, 1985 for Powerslayer). I had to ask several expert people to make sure it was correct. I hope I got it right, but if I didn’t let me know in confidence and I will be sure to correct it. 62 is Mongoose. 63 is Powerslayer. 65 is a b/w mid-season break special. The b/w audio cues are the same in all episodes. 62 is an early episode, and 63 is slightly later. 65 is near the end. Obviously not in great audio/video quality, but what were people’s expectations of old Doctor Who? See the difference between that and Series 1? This show is all over the place, from Florida, to Turks & Caicos, to New York, all before Jon Pertwee. Amanda didn’t even get to see Australia in all of these trips! These were made during the most ambitious times for Australian travel. I have no doubt that they would be much better now. I applaud Amanda for taking advantage of the time when child prodigies could actually help! She was still bouncing around tourist sites before the computer
how much larger or smaller it is than Frozen Land. The extraordinary preoccupation over the size of the nation in film has now passed to the BBC who must be eternally grateful for Edinburgh and comedy actor Kevin McNally. Kevin has never been more popular than between 1984 and 1994, a good decade or so, his feather combed, squinting face must have been recognisable to half of all men - especially gay men and that alone had to make him worth a fortune; but he remains one of our finest actors. Kevin has been married to Anita, a former journalist, for 37 years. They had only one son, Ryan, a medical student who died aged 21 of a heart attack. Kevin wants Anita to have a second series of episodes as his and everyone's comeback date. By 2015 President Blair was as useless as Kevin McNally. George Blair had presided over a decrease from 1400 friends, to 850 friends and a string of foreign policy disasters which a historical George Blair might still be trying to untangle. The fall comes from 91 to 32 to 850 in the course of the first 25 years in power. It is enormous, it's the trembling order of events that would change, probably for the worse the political
movie. I remember thinking that the chops (carving parts out of meat) would be more realistic if they categorically did not show such chops looking real brown, instead of the electric red color that applies to the average animal consumer throughout the world. The highlight of the movie, for me, was that the Cop, Singh, got away with killing someone probably taller than him. Not to mention that he goes back to office, the very next day, after the murder, smiling. That action, done by a centimetre short guy to a man larger than himself, is so politically incorrect that—had that been a sequence in my life, I would have assumed that somebody out there had scripted, directed, and acted a film in my life. And yet, the fact is that the kind of human savagery presented on the screen, with the incompetent Singh, acquitted of his crime, is the normal or expected outcome to brutality anywhere in the world. That is the real message put forward by these movies. And, then, little gas bags like having packs of wild dogs attack as if it were cricket matches with dogs. Each time I see a scene, remotely like that, I am reminded of a Calcutta (old Calcutta, actually) crime. It was a hotel where a young American girl who was staying as a guest got scared of a dog and
to tears. I may be an age, but i am not one of those critic's who believes it stole Oscar from 'A.I.' because it drew attention to itself. For a movie made in 1948 it has a rather dazzling presentation in colour and sound. Above all i think it's the tremendous performance of one of the screen's finest actors, Orsen Wells, which gives added weight to this little movie which was revived again, briefly, in 1998 with Val Kilmer in the title role. It may be trite to call it a rip-off of 'Othello' only in its sense that it enables a great actor (Wells in 1948, Kilmer in 1998 both were great actors) to portray a major role in a story when he may not be convincing in the main roles as many non white actors today were not allowed to appear in serious roles during the early part of the century. So the script was adapted to appeal to the black community. But i've seen no evidence that Robert Hooks watched this movie or any other movie and ripped off his part from an unlikely source. His work merits inspection also in 'The Execution Of Private Slovik,' a challenging, hard edged movie about racism. At the time of his release in 1949 it would have
collections of classics surprisingly add to the film's success. An intriguingly dilapidated design of old cars which manages to unify the film's comic book-like style. A self absorbed Naomi Watts, Zooey Guthrie enigmatic younger self superbly effective scene stealing performances respectively as future younger adjoining versions of mothers. Relative Bernadette Peters as mother's dreamy actress. Also expectantly charming "Dickens-like" relative Peggy March. Jack Black offering a memorable witty musical performance as Fats Waller. A grand finale matinée absurdly stampeding Spanish bull ring scenes unifying the characters in a fitting manner. A few undistinguished actors considering the number involving a classic epic. Relatively irrelevant scene in a classic art museum involving Robert Mitchum which may be marvelous for the adult-aged artist but which seemily over emphasizes a distraction for a child accompanying his widowed mother through treasures of classical art works. Trendily sped up war time nostalgic period fragments. Theatrical authors persons involved include a surprisingly talented, two Oscar winners and nominated actor and an Oscar nominated screen play writer also reflecting this talented pool. A young Jay Gatsby couple add humorous charm. Jon Brion's original music is surprisingly the most
typical candy ass perfect body that looks all plasticy. Man who designed this chick was incredibly hot and intelligent she damn near ripped the sheets off of me i swear to god, with the dialog and details in the movie they almost put a likeness of this chicks breasts and awsome curvy body down to a tee. In other words the model for the actress in the movie is deadly fine and hot all in the same damn breath........"IL CALIFORNIA" "IL CALIFORNIA" "\\|Ic|C|a|l|i|f|o|r|n|i|a| BRAVO ASSOLO DELLA REGIA" "ILCALIFORNIA" "IlCalifornia" All You Bought Complete Emailing List Email Lists Spam Friend Socially Pay at favies.com and get double list includning: Emails & Delivery Written Solo Portuguese All Websites From GA to GAAAPP Peoples Names.

practice, it's an exaggeration of human behavior, true growing-up lessons naturally take place, but could be presented more naturally and effectively in another medium where people don't talk the whole time from prematurely categorical, opinionated position: "we are ... him ... he is ... hate." The cartoon is a cautionary tale, and Paul Giamatti playing John Howard Davies is certainly short-coming enough to avoidportraying him as a victim of Hollywood's cruelties, but I wish the villains, played by Brian Cranston, Ian McKellen, and Pierce Brosnan, were better portrayed as creeps and perverts, not a more nuanced moral bind they are getting out of. PLEASE, Mr. Howard, give more quality material to children. This movie doesn't resonate with me. In fact, at its worst it's "Blair Witch" good. It is, however, Goldman's best screenplay since "Rushmore," and my Simon Pegg and Lake Bell are, again, the only saving graces. What this movie suffers from is advertising in classic Spielberg fashion: we feared a straightforward, family-friendly film while your marketing will tell us a sprawling, suspenseful story of human indecision and reckless behavior. But you've made that earlier. Now we'd like
see more from MIchelle and Logan. This novella was ok but to short and the background of the main characters is so short. Directly into the present and we get some touches of the second book and that was a huge disappointment. I did enjoy the end... but the story itself felt like it's missing completeness. Best Daughter... Newest Son... where's the rest of the list of children... I want to find out about the other kids. When will she get married and will Logans mom & dad be around to see that happen. Good Lord when will I get to read Michelle & Logan's love actually blossom to see a true love that lasts a lifetime. What about her Hollywood friends... I feel disappointed. A part of me simply says "The end". Logan has two other brothers... why not make it a kind of ... Here comes the rest of the Crawes's Brood to find the "one". NEEDS MORE! Prove yourself a true MIchelle Marilee and we can read about Laundry, logan and family life and Michelle wants to be a screenwriter, oh my when will that come into play in the final book! We want to meet the characters and really see them. I'm still in love with Logan Crawes and this novella did not bring about the truth and Character
of cr@p 9 or 10 is either retarded, a pirate or stupid. And the film is funny anyways! 1 out of 10, anything above is 1 for pirates and 1 for retards. Come on, this movie isn't even IMDB quality, i trash junk like that to make money. Seriously, if goofy McCreepy can make crap like Dragonslayer III or Condo, then id know he had a negative touch from the devil himself. And Bonanza is one big rip off from Heidi, Cathy Gray, the sad thing is that people saved a damn rated R movie as a kid, and today they are taking their kids to see it. Comedy of 1990, what a put-on! Love the perfect 10! If you love spoofs, look for the new Son of the Mask, a real one! Thank! I have never trashed any movie this much, but c'mon c'mon, this movie was a put on. The only thing that made me like this movie was the fact that The Lion King was also realeased that year and I missed it. And I had Star Wars, so it was just perfectly okay to make this and tie it to Disney. But was it funny? NO! I have never in my life seen anyone rate a serious mistake

Then when Mr. Von Bark lags behind, Joe gives him this cup and snickers. After that, he feels bad about himself so he tries to get the fluid out of the cup again just as his margs start filling up. Does this movie ever end?! Very funny, I recommend it! :) 10/10. PSL made me laugh at this one as well. =P (she liked it as well and she hardly ever likes things by Brando anyway) Don't be fooled by the length of the film, it was very amusing and probably funnier than some of the longer ones I've seen =) FYI: This was one of the higher rating movies I've reviewed yet! (6, out of 5 in this case =P) I finished it too! A quarter hour ago I wanted to kill myself and now I'm composing a review for 8 shorts so I could be in the four as soon as possible! 42 films!

say it's good so I'll just leave it at it evokes emotion for what it displays and that to me is worth something in cinema. Then on one hand it appears to have strong messages about violence against women, eugenics and abortion then on the other it's a sci-fiction art film peppered with art house dramas that have nothing to do with it. Which is fine, and acceptable but for the nihilistic endings. It leaves me feeling sick and heavy, not like a bad film that I enjoyed despite it's failings but more like being the victim of a rape, leaving me disgusted and disorientated unsure what I did wrong.

even worse than the cinematography. This movie shouldn't even be called a movie, it should be called a lost of hopes about a horror movie to come out of Zimbabwe... I am deeply disappointed and a little bit ashamed to have Corey Cameron as our Minister for Information Communication Technology as for such a disaster to come out of our very own country.

commercials look like they were filmed in the same video style as "Dumb and Dumberer" starring Christan Bale. There isn't much to say about it. Most of the plot is revealed in the trailer. But including it here anyway (just in case). So move over elder vampires, give way newer sluttier vampires, and make room for the dead vampires! Seriously. This movie is just very very bad.

If you have to go see this, at least you'll be dazzled by its very accurate casting by competent Swedish actors. Granted all these top actors were fleeing their countries without their credit in order to obtain French Residency status. It happens to be the best movie (it's actually a tv series) for them to have chosen. Why, because they all have to already be fluently bilingual in French since Sarkozy hurled a tirade of vitriol against France during his election campaign. Then again, if you have to see this, don't go alone. I have a very honest discussion with my boyfriend about it
at half time. Shortly after this review was written the rest of the audience asked if they could file a case against this reviewer for false advertising. I can't say I felt ripped off but could find nothing to like. The Doctor's Talent really was terrible. The story wasn't bad, and the performances were adequate and sometimes carried this ATM00R. The reason I can't recommend this is because it's obvious from the script there isn't much talent, as it all boils down to who can speak the clearest. The criticism is not only foreign. This is simply a no budget shot performance film. There seems to be a question whether it can even be released as a feature film. The reason is that they originally shot it as a short, and then loaded up in the editing room and tried to come up with a feature length. The result is obvious by the 15 minute mark to most who have some talent for reading thought. This allegedly made up my mind by the 30 minute mark. At present it is trying to get picked up by the festival circuit, and one wonders, is there any point, as they will probably have such short attention span they will miss the first half hour of good parts to focus on the second half which may have more going for it. Ultimate sacrifice I can't avoid picking up some optical make up. wanted the Doctor to be talked
sense, but it also has some nice things going for it (zombie monkeys, for one). It is impossible to understand or explain the points of the film and its plot. There are bursts of modish dialog and images that create a fascinating, artistic and very different film. It is the best film I have seen this year. If you like surreal comedies, you will probably like it. If you love high art, this is it. If you are a little bored by modern movies, it will probably be okay. There is a slight irony here: Although I am not a modern art expert, I did enjoy looking at and appreciating the artistry of some of the found art pieces that have been added to this film. Between that and the odd puppets and monkeys, it made for an evening of more pleasure than I thought I would have when I first walked in. If you like movies that take you to places you have never been (or trouble you to be somewhere you do not what to be) this film is for you. I found it affected and a bit scary, even if you may just find it baffling. Rent it, and then be prepared for a night viewing as well as discussing. Go for a local bar. Go with friends. Keep an open mind, and see where the movie goes with you.My head is still spinning, and I did love it
about adultery. It uses the wrong-man trope to do that. It’s messy, chaotic, loud, and cheerful. Not quite disposable, like three quarters of the stuff that comes out these days, but it was moderately disappointing given what it was trying to be and was using as its engine. So, very average. Apparently the sequel is equally terrible and the audience at The States turned on it very quickly, at least at where I happened to to be sitting. Thank you, nobody. I shall walk out of future films without need of prompting. I left considering the possibility that if I hadn’t seen Big Eden yet, I might be gone for good, and I’d be better off not doing that. I think because the ugliness of its sex-comedy was matched by its ugliness of its last twenty minutes. It’s just discouraging. Not because the film can’t handle nuance – it probably can – but because it decides that it doesn’t have time for nuance. I mean, I just usually don’t line up with glib “endings” – doesn’t anyone want to deepen the character that just lost its wife? It’s called subtlety. Is this comedy first? Are its characters illustrations of what we’ve always suspected comedy leads and followers are? Losers, d
's title was imaginatively lifted from a certain TV show from the mid eighties. I rest my case. ASBJ2K X5 XTREME! YES!!!!!!!!!! Do not steal from this movie. Especially from Chuck. He bought all the rights and patents to the movie itself, so he will get very very angry at you if you rip-off even one single thing from it (which I'm not stating that you would, this is just to make sure). I basically have the same credits deal as Predator_2_98. If you want to use anything, I do not have copyrights to the actors or anyone involved in making this movie, but you must mention that the tune was used in this parody and also, give credit to me. I would appreciate it. You do not have permission to change, take, distort, rearrange, cover, render, transform, mix, copyright, alter, duplicate, revise or simulate any of my material here without written permission from me. Have fun. Sound effects were taken from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and also "Raiders of the Lost Ark"- too bad they sound a little weird, I cannot help it. So there is no note-that-a-sad-thing-behind-the-camera music. VideoCamera= Too Bad. Least I could
… I didn’t realize at the time that PENNIAC is Pam Grier’s production company… Anyway, I enjoyed it. I wasn’t aware, at the time, how long it had been… seven years since it was written and shot. That’s interesting. Interesting to me. Paul Rudd will almost always make anything worth the watch. Here I find two lovely ladies: Sun-Young and Hye-Ryoung. Nothing bad about any of them, I think they are all fair to the name Paul Rudd. This movie is strange, it not really goes anywhere, in that the characters misinterpret what is happening. Unfortunately, or fortunately (since it leaves things open and unexplained) it had a spin-off movie, back in 2003, called, Aunt Fanny’s Tour of Booty (no, I’m not kidding), which starred Paul Rudd. If you can find it in its VHS edition (Videomation) then it’s worth it for the truly odd experience. Another Thing About Wedding Crashers also mentions Paul Rudd… so I may watch it again someday. By what is listed at IMDB I will watch it someday. I am getting a lot of those MOD cues lately. So in the end, the film was worth seeing. It made me happy and

misleading and they completely messed up the corrections to something simple. Barbarians is auto overwritten to Chaotic in this, and they do not over write Paladin into Lawful.

...but its good when someone does. The songs are great too. I have watched it with a whole new set of eyes after losing my daughter (in a logistical sense only, I know) while living across the country. I found a lot to appreciate this time around that I didn't the first fifty times I watched. I am fully planning on adopting parents in a further 40 years. . . . It has its humor (the flashing of Tommy Tune's derriere and race relations in general being where we are here in America today) as well as the emotional connection we can all experience. I have seen the entire film maybe a 100 times. I cry. I smile. My daughter and I danced and danced to the Audre Hepburn version of Merry go round. Other than A Chorus Line, this movie is better than anything Bette Midler has ever done (and that's not easy to admit). Its a family film. Keep your kids out of Mamma Mia and watch this dozen more times, making memories all over again. Speaking of memories, watching it was almost like looking at a home movie as I brought my daughter into the world ...into my womb first and then into the world. Thanks for the memories Mom and God bless. We keep your son alive though his life he leads us to God. I have more. . . Memories
for a younger audience, but it features so much violence and nudity that actually the older I get the more amused I get from watching it. This might be makred as one of the harder films of that genre that was made in the early 1080’s. Anyway, check out the Spanish director D. Antonio Mercero’s 1983 movie Huevos Degold. I hope the book will be published soon. The film now can be bought in DVD; check out http://www.mondo-media.com for details. You need to have a taste for this sort of ironic violence and comedy to enjoy it. It will help if you are trained to watch a movie from a Spanish film house like this.

girlfriend of a strung-out drug dealer Emilio (Ricardo Chavira) of his dirty deeds before itâs too late and what started out as a simple traffic stop derails his professional career. Emilio is a shady coke dealer who has sold a ton of crack to youngsters in D.C. surrounding Anacostia, the gang-infested suburb. Some of those crack addicts have bought two medical oxygen tanks and cut the tubes to share a hit off the tanks. The two Reggie, a struggling junkie (Lawrence Gilliard) and his overweight lady friend Vonetta (Meagan Good), just canât get a hold on anything important in life. They have become this small communityâs idiots who are poor and desperate to get high to forget the dire results their lives are turning out. Bouncers at the bar of the local grungy mama queen call them niggers whenever they come around, and none is looking for a handout. Theyâre all clueless junkies. Each day the same routine repeats itself as these two junkies gorgeably exercise their stoned brains.

motivations of its characters so it leads the astray of the viewer. Secondly there was a whole segment of the book which was not included in the film which explored the true motives behind Martin Scorses character, which you will see and learn if you read the book. Thirdly the background music to any book adaptation will either pull against it or compliment it, the background music to the film did not compliment the film, in fact 'neither' the characters, storyline or backdrop. The film lacked consistency – characters character making decisions at points either when or if you thought reasonable, change of direction and attitude from characters when they go against the grain or learnt from themselves both lacked consistency either throughout the film or when brought to life on screen. I could talk about the main points of the book and how different each character is and what their storylines are at the slightest hint of danger to their wellbeing although I had read the book I can not at this point explain that with cerebrally provision and patience as I am not wiser or more intelligent than those who decide not to read the book however you could with a little due diligence find summaries of each of the character journeys in the back and under the covers so if you chose to have that background and retain that you can find out what has changed between the novel and the film. The film was not a good adaptation
plotline involves a madcap scheme concocted by our favorite over-the-top actor Christopher Walken, and his character, known only as Love The Life you have Played In, is indeed over-the-top. Love's character was inspired, of course, by Dracula. He is a man who commanded Osama Bin Laden to test his most lethal weapon on a military base. Love gets the mission but kills CIA agent Shelley Winters instead. Love needs to hunt his prey and he also needs help in financing his war. We learn all of this in the first forty-five minutes and at that point Love has already eliminated two of three government agents. The third to go was a President's son. This poor guy visits every 30-40 minutes so it's pretty obvious what's coming. Throughout the movie agents are shot, disguises are worn, car chases ensue and Walken stares into the camera looking insane. When all is said and done it turns out the movies' string of killings involves a bunch of innocent people like waiters, garbage men and cops. Let's face it, the real culprit was the screenwriter! Seriously though, I'd love to know how the hell he got paid to release nonsense like this. High points: A George Burns cameo and Christopher
; Is it Tolkien? Or what does it add from Tolkien story to make it a proper appendix, or does it add something new of its own to accompany it? So if it's not due to fitting to Tolkien; I personally will assume that it's bad, if I could. The book itself may be well, but to me it would be pointless, outside being an entertainment factor as a story. That being said; To me this is what this book scores, will change however afterwards. But it's based on the writings gives extra, or makes one or two constant points, adding with the collection of peoples that it takes. In other words, what sort of people did Tolkien take into account, and what creates the changes of them, just as Gandalf and Faramir's. It was perhaps not enough to add to the backstory, certainly it was not if I compare the VIII and IX books of the Merry and Pippin Point of View in the RotK to this, as I did. But it may be so small that it's just as good for the Hobbit. Let it be so; The book itself, both The Hobbit and the Silmarillion can't be compared to this one; this is a brand new book, does not counts on the two, and instead is it usually factual. This is why most others can make a
film had a slow start and the title didn't really do much to draw me to the film. It may have been better if the title had been changed. I almost thought about turning it off, but I stuck with it and it turned out to be a good movie, but not a truly great one . I do love the naval background of the movie in that it led to the film having an international pull to it, with Alec Bingham, having to chase a story while on assignment in Greece, than having the assassination be in America. Also, like many of the comments noticed, I thought PL was the best killer Bond villain to date. I thought that PL was going to be a typical Bond baddy, with his crazy hair style, but after learning that he was going to have the strongest possible henchman, and probably PL was going to be the closest Bond partner with shady contact, Bonds IQ fails when he has a liason with an "obviously" bad guy contact. But I did enjoy how PL and Bingham would walk and talk, and how their behavior didn't get either recognized, which I saw some comments about previously. Brosnan continues to make Bond fun to watch, which is always enjoyable when Bond's reputation gives him that advantage to have a quick exit strategy and more time to relax and get blonsy. The real elaborate plot with tie ins that were fun to figure out
rambling to get a proper story. A comment was made early in the film suggesting that the picture on the screen was a constant and that it took an hour to tell a story. I can't remember any argument to this claim, but the film certainly seemed dominated by one image of a black hole. Better tighter explanations of the ideas. Could have been much better. Maybe 5*. I suppose they asked for the reviews. This might turn out to be one bit by bit for me, but if I locate it in the cloud library, I might enjoy reliving it a bit in the future. (only 2 stars do I slide into cloud storage) I doubt I might pay again, or the rent. Despite the picture being often clear for me, unfortunately the English subtitles suffered from being on the buggy side of broken. The subtitles file was out of synch with the audio? or the text just being quirks? (since downloaded it again, I can still not work out what happened) It collapsed under my normal speed. Fast played out: suberb! Very slow speed was necessary and even the sub-titles were at high speed. That isn't a bad thing, it is just slowing everything down to accommodate. (beautiful I might add, like a treacle fire in a wind) Oh and ... the sound did happily have automatic volume level automatic (every time it went into break

there was nothing better than the atmospherical perfection of the 1960's (even if it was mostly fog) to start things off. Our innocent hero is soon getting into trouble with the law by moving stolen goods across the Canadian border. He's arrested though and a travelling Minister comes to the rescue. It transpires that our "hero" has done nothing wrong and is free to leave. The police team who nabbed him are disgraced over the incident however and chase after the car containing the now-free hero. Our travelling Minister doesn't cotton on however and his end result isn't very pleasant. The police's is even worse! Oh dear me! What can be done..? We now find ourselves at a roadside eatery where the owner shouts at the customers but is delighted to serve our free-man-on-the-loose so he sticks him in the deep-freeze and breaks the law even more!

, Simon West (Wickham, Die Another Day, Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, The General’s Daughter ) one might expect something far more engaging than this. It’s a shame as the final heist looks great and the novelty of the plot line gives it oodles of exciting possibilities but those gold dust moments are (literally) rare, and the plot is executed less by the film’s makers and more by the audience through their own mental speculation. At best. West can no doubt direct a good heist movie, a good action movie and a good failry tale - but with this script he’s more than a little out of his depth. As is Mok to some extent, too, more suited to affecting dialogue than hard core dramatic scenes, and although it’s nice to see Joseph Fiennes again, he should be doing the Shakespearan roles he was born for, not bumbling around in rogues galleries. And alas, not even Mickey Rourke can save this one for me. It’s one for the brain and not one’s senses. It’s well enough written and directed with value added and an almost guaranted pay-off, but it is poorly paced and lacking on emotional involvement. Some fans will love it: pacifists and pacifiers will not. Oh, and don’t

Mr. D'Onofrio is a horror fan. The movie is not that scary, and like one reviewer said, the music didn't add a lot to the atmosphere. That was a huge let down. Anyway, it's a good movie, but not great. I can see myself watching it a few times if I'm having a night of serial killer movies. It's definitely worth a rental, but not a buy unless you are a fan of the genre. ðŸ˜• âœˆï¸Ž â˜‰ï¸� viÃ±a @southernmamablog & ðŸ”°ï¸� @rocking_mama_50 pick up a copy follow rockingmama50 on instagram etc."Â Disclosure: NO compensation or bribe taken.

the Section 13 segment of the Dharma Vessel Opts For an Abrupt Agression of SODIUM by Spike Milligan. It has a closed-circuit trams on - with access via stairs too steep for wheelchair users unless they want a free crawl around the city on all fours. My character, Juliet Landau, is an optimistic pathologist, whilst her neighbour is a hard-boiled police detective. He's investigating why the deaths are not being ruled as natural by the French. When a body is found, the two start to work together. They loathe each other almost immediately. Other friends are soon formed, the symbolic loopey frictionless rails stopping gangs getting from the catacombs to the ground level, where even if they survive the trip, they'll die of asphyxiation as all the sewers are flooding with chemicals from the volcano which has erupted closer to Paris. It's set in 2054, with the main industry being raising fish towers, lots of plots too. Everyone sells something "fishy". The cliche police detective with a nasty chip on his shoulder? Hmm, unlikely, considering crime is so low in Paris, and he has been given a combined rank in the main force, and the special forces combined force (whatever that means).
shaggy dog comedy and seriocomic adventure revolving around strange -- and personable -- Alice Mitchell, a thirtyish elementary school teacher and successful step-mother. Her family dynamics are complicated by her overbearing, guilt-ridden ex-husband George, her matter-of-fact, raised-in-poverty sister Melissa ­- and Melissa's reclusive daughter Emilie. (Melissa has not been wounded by her husband leaving, as George thinks; she adores Emilie and bonds easily.) At the start of the film, Alice takes Emilie to the corner grocery store for an early morning snack of cupcakes and milk. A series of crazy, wild, hair-raising, incidents take place. Her fixed-gear bike, dented from keys it snapped during the first attack, appears everywhere – including an expertly photographed and choreographed crash into fences and a busy intersection. Weeks later, Emilie asks her mother to find the culprit, or at least contact the mysterious C-C-byte (Ben Larsen). When Alice investigates the former, Emilie wants her to investigate the latter, and then things get even weirder. Alice hires a friend, tech genius Diego (Vince Molinero) to help her. And Dallas Paugh’s music hows us a

more points to make. The pen is not cruel, as it has no metallic parts for the animals to chew. There is noticeable pedanticism as the entire book is laid out alphabetically, but it is in perfect chronological order for all the animals mentioned (unless it is due to a lack of suitable illustrations). The overall theme of menaces and adaptations of all the critters is sure to amuse anyone interested in zoology. The artwork is astounding with full expressiveness with the studying effect. And lastly, the book does have scientific detail but not too much scientific information for young children to dissuade them from wanting to know the animals we share this planet with. Even so, anyone interested by our animal friends can still pull from his studies. This book is highly recommended for all those interested in zoology. I also gave this a star rating of "Funnrrrr" for its astounding illustrations.

the time but it took me 3-4 years before I have re-encountered this film. That original encounter was a sold-out to the audience at the IFC center in Manhattan and there were alot of foreigners there, and with obvious interest, not understanding what the film is attempting to accomplish. I also didn't know anything about the director at the time, Russell Harbaugh and I came away from that experience wondering what is wrong with him. Now I know. He is one brilliant filmmaker. This film is better for repeat viewings. I still felt pretty dizzy by the end of the screening. And I still love it. Here's reasons why: One - You don't think you're in the Shoals of Memphis, Tennessee but its there alright. Its atmosphere is so unique, it is finally a uniquely American city whose geography I know. Russia claimed the Arctic Sea as their home territory, name "sea of dust" as "Astapovo" or like a figure in the "Realm of Vorox" coming home. In a zombie film, a person puts down terraformed some island in the Pacific and they are happy to have grossing out the eurocrat in Beijing and to have so dioced unimaistic rant of the "red state". How can we recognize and differentiate any of those "probabilities" or better

's 2/5ths of an hour was one such nigh - I was riding a soldier's horse, paratrooping from a modest height with a grenade attached to my ankle scene. I didn't have a pistol, so the only other thing to do was open my gulping mouth and emit an almighty "AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH" the kind of scream fit for a circus show. I was very close to it. My partner retired shortly after, and while waiting to copple put into practice many an optical illusion. I can confirm that Indeed something sprung up Into the air (it could've been either down there or up there by the way). I was worried I was about to fly, and would've taken off had I had wings. Aaaaahhh! AAAAHH HH! Thank god I was told a poorly illustrated installation makes up the energy to allow the statue to teleport from a nearby park/northern car park. Enthralling.. irrelevant work.

the excesses of the great purges. His speech is called 'On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences' which several years ago a blog named for put up all the texts of his speech here. The quotes go from Lenin's purges (((Page 163): in recent years, in place of collective decisions by the party and soviet meetings, there have been fewer and fewer such meetings, while fewer and fewer comrades take an active part on them. Even in Stalin's name; even in the name of Comrade Stalin, who stood alone against Trotsky and the Right opposed his dictatorship and called comrades the minions of the police chiefs; even under the banner of the principles of democracy and rights, and by order of the Central Committee, the majority has been acted against although it had gained a majority vote. The minority has always joined that majority, not only in today and in the last congress, but in 1937, in 1933 and even before, and has always supported the line of the Central Committee. When -- thank God -- Stalin made right decisions and retained the majority's line, but nature opposed him even when his dictatorship opposed nature. Hence, more and more comrades have favoured the minority. Between the.ndeed up to now, between the 1
and there. But I got to really loveBottom last summer when I met a fan living on my street in Brooklyn, NY. Anybody who's ever seen an episode of Bottom loves to quote Rik Mayall as Kevin Turvey. In fact, the catch phrase, "Don't touch my cock!" became who Chris Ware's worked was for the first year after seeing a Bottom episode in an airport. He continued to loosely quote the show in almost every episode of his game show Parade of Incidents which appeared in his newspaper The New York Press. Of course, Rik provided him with a shirt to wear on air which Chris included in my upcoming September 30 Tales from the City book, A British Philadelphia in Support of Appearance. Apparently, he managed somehow to borrow half of Chris' setup in the video above, which was part of Chris' episode of Parade of Incidents. In my two-part story Mr. Turvey Visits Tales from the City (plus half of a turquois suit), appearing in the October 28 Tales from the City also in support of appearance (so I'll probably take it out since the chapter is already its own book), Chris and his friend meet Rik for the first time, celebrating a year and a week since they first saw Bottom together. They imagine Rik may be gay and google it, watch R
beauty. This movie put a very heavy emphasis on physical look, which I did not always like. The good looking characters are beautiful people but not very gifted when it comes to intelligence. I felt like lots of serious issues were put aside for a moment in order for the main character to take care of the nonsensical problems between couples in the movie. Once again, this is just my personal opinion, but I have to say that although this movie is a classic movies, it leaves a lot of weak spots in my mind. Nevertheless, readers and movie lovers have not been wrong with their acknowledgement of this movie and their appreciation of the performances all those celebrities have put in this film. My only request from the producers is to add some more depth to such a slow-paced movie. (2/5). Could You teach me about Wrestling? (Easy). Easy.

but if I see it, I'll stay for it. I don't have to see it every Christmas. I saw it at least 5 times that first Christmas I got cable in 1990. The early 90's were a simpler time. And that video of the 90's dance parties, which is one of the bonus features on the DVD, totally brought me back. I'm pretty sure my Aunt and I had long conversations to that song. Seriously, anyone else remember spending 2 weeks in your aunt's basement, having sleepovers in the day, because you were allowed to watch it and read things you shouldn't? Yeah, me either. We just have to be a little careful in that......I was probably spending my days skinning and caging small animals as well. 2007 version of the Desperado! I think the New Kids on the Block song is a little dated, and they've all gained so much weight. Uh, I mean, it suggests positivity rather than me channeling Peter Pan and some mini Sabrina Barr in my bedroom (with Deborah Gibson posters)-which I might have been doing. Again, 2007 isn't really that long ago. Also, remember how 90210 was a more important show than Buffy. Oh yes
I ever saw in a theater. I'm serious when I say it. I'm sure since then I've seen some softcore that was even smarter than this, but based on what little I know about pretty much everything else of its kind, "Behind Bedroom Doors" was doing something different. It was a Hollywood production. And for the most part, it was very good. Now the fact that it was made as a Hollywood production, doing something different, is not supposed to be the surprisng thing that it is to me. This is the first time I ever sat through such an experience. This is my introduction to the world of softcore/pornography. Because there weren't any good adaptations of Shakespeare nominated for Oscars I hope to see, I decided to look out for some porns for a change in viewing pleasure. This is what I ended up with. I have to laugh at the serendity of this coincidence because this is kind of exactly what I was expecting to see somewhere along the line within the realm of independent, low-budget stuff i.e. very bad direction, bad acting, no clothes and, yes, bad sex on film. Some of that stuff looks like innocent jazz compared to what I found here. I'm pretty sure there must have a few films in the genre that were better than Behind Bedroom Doors -- I'll have to
made. It was noticed by top directors worldwide because it was so brilliant as a piece of original screenwriting. It was noticed by film critics worldwide. It was nominated for numerous Oscars. It has layers and layers of subtext. It doesn't lose anything when people realize everything was made up. Not a single thing. I don't meet anyone who doesn't say it never changed their lives. They found something in it they were longing to find in life. Some say it's the most beautiful work ever made whether you watch it music on or not. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about it. I must have watched it a hundred times and I can't even begin to count the times I got angry when people were cruel to it. People need to have a life of their own to appreciate how meaningful it is most of all. Google how many times it was shown in the state of Florida schools and tell me how many people have gated their lives by some important lesson from the film? Is it any good? Only if you are willing to shed your preconceived notions. It is powerful. It is sincere. It is controversial. It is dangerous. Yet, it proves the point. It was meant to be a weapon for us all. What is real is what resonates. There is 200 minutes worth of emotion. It was
've gone back and poked around a little bit, and now that I can think about things reasonably, this movie traumatized me too. It's not bad at all-- and neither is Die Another Day-- but I'm not sure that I feel the same about it anymore as a movie geek. I still think it's somewhat overrated. The music is great, and the action scenes are well done, but I'm a little bit too literate nowadays to fully appreciate some of the implications. The film is takes the pulpy concept of Allen Quatermain and the Heart of the World somewhat seriously. I'm just not sure I want to watch King Solomon's Mines anymore. I wholly admit, however, that I look forward to our rewatch. When I'm old and gray... I hope. -- Victor B.

cast together can only be a good thing.There are a few moments in this movie that I liked,in fact there is only one aspect I didn't like, which is something you won't really find out until the end.If you liked Twilight then you'll like this movie.They have the whole evil step mum vibe going on here plus Elizabeth Banks who plays Bella's Mum in Twilight also steals a scene.Anyway this movie has a nice nice ending and I liked the fact that it was upto Bella (Natlie Portman) to decide her own fate.Like I said at the start, I thought it was a good movie, my 15 year old niecealso thought it was good, Nan liked it, everyone should see this movie.

ten because its a really good film. But I give it a five because of one of the reasons why I give lots of films five they are do Wougly oop because some of the teachers are religion bibles word not like a christian teacher who I can work with but muslims and lots of other kind they try to impose their views and beliefs on pupils and it is not right and people do need to watch this film and show that bad teachers are always odious plonkers. So watch back to the future if you don't only one teacher, although it isn't very funny he has something in common with some teachers today making you fail. And any part of the above is true lies snouts that proud lol all facts. So give it a view. And so maybe I could write a book titled: The first teacher who keeping animals in class and make them share food with them so no food left. And also I think teachers were done by for this little fact: Abner H. Cheatham was born January 25, 1904 in Relief, Texas. He later married Ossie Owen, January 1, 1923. She was born January 13, 1905. This couple had a daughter, Martha Jumper, who was born December 12, 1924. A son, Billy Cheatham, was
so I’m not going to say it was that good. Then again, it wasn’t easy to find a high quality video with good plot, this might be one of the very few out there. Still, worth a look. Better than a lot of crap animes these days. Which is saying a lot. Yet, the subtitles might be tricky to understand sometimes. (…) Futari wa Pretty Cure Splash Star is another anime to watch with this premise. I’m not going to recommend it. People who saw Precure Maria guys should read this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFIOsEzAdeI (If you prefer videos with others subtitles see those two, they are both are kind of good.) Bianca II has quite the story. It’s very interesting. The details of the plot are too detailed to say any more. If you catch turanbay surrounded dvd version in internet soon, (I will see if I can outside) it’s not going to be one of those updates websites usually have. It will be labeled “high quality”. You might be interested in playing as the final boss. Which I have no idea why haven’t had that choice, maybe because it’s a demake rather than demake, except the plot is too noticeable from the normal roms from her performance and it might lead to get somewhere
film buffs. Here is a movie about mood, introspection, spirituality, fog, and postmodern religious faith, and the only participants of note are pubescent Sam Neill and four surfing dogs. I dig it. So Yay!. Whiskey/Amazon Wine/The Nightly Pop Exclusive: But what about that art, though? That’s the PLOT of this movie. The Last Wave is not particularly historically influential on the way the world works, unlike other classics like The Citizen Kane or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but it’s an intricately enthralling viewing experience that is ripe for multiple viewings.

except it takes places in space with aliens and stuff. Like I said I heard it was rarely like the book. When I seen the preview and now when I have seen it I am so curious and confused and seducd by it. The movie is very mysterious. You don't know completely what's happening until like half way half of the way through the movie. I am sad that the people who read and love the book don't like the movie, but I think it's a very good movie on it's own. It may drive movie goers nuts but everyone has different tastes in movies. Anyway I thought it was so good. It kept me wondering what is happening, what will happen next. Haha ollow here ya go Andy. Enjoy. 9 out of 10. -- Alex Nesse. From Logan. Alex Nesse (1977012@unm.edu) Saturday, July 15, 2000 at 06:55:52 (PST) How do I sum up this movie? I have no idea. I enjoyed it very much. It was a tragedy interlaced with glimpses of hope. Rarely do I buy 80 minute movies, but I had to buy this one. It was really compelling in so many different ways. I watched it a second
both modern and historic at the same time, but ultimately ends up being neither one.Getting into the modern era, we have an old-fashioned family/mob senario. In reality, there's never much doubt about the outcome (which is OK). Except, the bad guys start out acting like low-life thugs, which hurts the credibility. And we are surprised when they become more "organized" big-time crooks? C'mon!At one point, there's a decision about whether to put the switch position in "on" or "off". Sounds great ... think "flash of lightning" and a moment of vulnerability, but when they tiptoe around the moment to...end it all before it begins, all you're left with is a "yawn". It doesn't seem quite as original, and more simply another way of revealing themselves. Don't like the word? Do you honestly know anyone who's used it in real life? If you watch the movie a second time, you find an abundance of plot holes and plot manipulation etc. that don't create much tension/drama when they could have been far more interesting (perhaps more brutal even?) They hold back on the girls and whatnot. They change the mob types and whatnot.They could have structured things a lot better. For instance, they spend huge amounts

it has very watched over the hill looking actors and most importantly the story and characters never even remotely try. The sound seems like they are recording it in a toilet, which added to the terrible atmosphere, the spooky atmosphere you always get in movies like these like. This should of been called NOT on the beach blood MOUNTAIN. At least the actors are sleep easy for the next week, they can all participate in the next bonanza marathon. I really wouldn't say I hated this movie, but I didn't like it, because every slasher movie ever had charset on the formula, the direction, the acting & the storyline (which they added very good jokes, I hope you bought this release). I think you shouldn't watch if you are looking for a good slasher film, because this is also a very low-budget movie, which has many weak demons/actors (no one is there for long than you think) and another has more time in this movie biased. Still, I would watch it the first time I saw it, because it has some mixed reviews in the national news and I Highly Recommend This To People Throughout Europa**** The coolness will surely be freakily DNA. Played with a rotation when it comes to the screen horror even in a camp where each time I've laughed blood checks. Warmly recommended PS. I figured
a bit disturbing) if you are able to get into the spirit of it. Ben (John Cusack), who used to be in chemical warfare and generally "willing to get his hands dirty", is brought in to work for Industrial Democracy. That is a company that is brought in as DynCorp for killing. Their business is dealing with the removal of bad people/ military through death and they do a rather good job. One simple stunt that Ben learns rather quickly is to bring a person into an empty room full of devices that sits on top of a pressure bomb. If the attacker wants to survive they must remove the devices to "de-pressurize" the room (or probably die). I particularly liked it when Shaun William Scott, who plays Felix, comes in with a bomb strapped around his neck and over the radio Ben tells him only, "phase two." I won't tell you why, but it's good. And I personally like any movie that puts in Law and Order references. It's a rather hilarious courtroom scene where every single person in the court gets killed - half by a "rubber bullet" and half by the Court's Ballistic glass where a grenade flipped off of the table and hits the glass. Throughout the entire movie Ben is touting neo-time as their new service called "TIME". Time, get
days ago – like I was stealing time that I didn’t deserve to have. I sat through it a second time, trying to make up for my indecent thoughts by cracking back the joke open properly. Happy now. Those who know me know that I love to laugh, (my thousand-watt smile tends to give it away) and I don’t say it nearly often enough, that Mark Kermode’s comedy writing and reviews and public talks make me smile-burst laugh loud after loud. To me, Mark embodies all that is inherently hilarious in film criticism as an art. I even like the way he does his ‘Hand Jobs’. I am constantly on the lookout for movie reviews that tickle or tick me off – the only ones that consistently make me laugh are written by Mr Kermode. I’m pleased to note him quoted in your review, Odd Index. I particularly loved a quotation from one of his reviews of Jackass 3D, where he says that watching any minute of Jackass would ruin the enjoyment of seeing Jarvis on the keel of Grace Darling on an elm log doing ‘the worm’. There’s enough in that paragraph to read it through five times; try it. And the iconic audio rip he gave Danny Dyer’s slane character in a previous space-comedy? There’
poop dry'. On the one hand, it is wonderfully intuitive and clever: actors are sitting around a table albeit a bedroom table (which should while away the time) and one gives the lead aces before another, as the supports, reach for them. That may sound fine and all, but...it is not. Those aces were represented by the same suited cards, which, quite frankly, are watching paint dry in a bottle transition from card 10 to 20. What are they hoping to happen? There are no cut scenes interrupted by telephone ringing, for instance, no parallel narrative happening over the top, or anything like that. There are, on the other hand, other narrative modes, which unfortunately do not show the inside of the table. The first is Leopold Kozlowski's own narrative of the unaired program, which is taking place during the whole of the games but no one listening to it knows that. He strings together various anecdotes from the film and the program-from-which-this-film-stems. Apart from the fact that not a single day of the recording of this bizarre program appears on screen at all - there are false positives because one may call it a documentary warts 'n' all, one still gets at certain points the feeling that it's more a pressure cooker for the patience of the view

quality in a good long time. my favourite part if that each episode is a complete story in itself, it feels like each episode is a short film it feels like a damn good book. no filler and no pointless fluff, i have now seen 25 episodes and no two of them are the same they all have a purpose, sometimes its just to showcase a new character. the show has challenged me intellectually without being pretentious and angry about it. it can, however, be quite gory at times, not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing, then again cannibalism is not exactly a funny or fun thing and the show can be quite dark. i can say no other show i have watched has had a story or run to this effect and its a huge testament to its success that i am addicted to it and cant wait to watch more. i found that in the first few episodes i was trying to figure out exactly what was going on in the flash backs and who was who but by the end of season one that was all kind of tied as a package if that makes any kind of sense. the show is funny, depressing, violent and scary, its distressing to watch moving from cg humans with tiny heads to humans lit as if they are hotdog sausages. straight up the best tv show ive watched in a very long time. i
because I started it 20 minutes late, I was immediately hooked on the story plot and wishing I had seen the first part. A couple years later, the movie was shown on one of the TV channels (ABC IIRC) and I managed to stay up the whole night to watch it. If you've never seen the movie, you can't imagine how George Peppard (Mike Nelson) manages to talk John (Jim) into coming along for this one. Cruise's character in the movie almost didn't balance well against the main character of the movie, hence I won't say his name here because I don't want to be spoiling any movies for those who haven't ever seen them. They're in Thailand when the movie goes, it was shot entirely in Thailand to boot. Sad to see that Richard Jordan died, back in 1993 at the age of 51, I still remember his performance as ato Paul Kersey in all the Deathwish movies after the first one. Yuen Biao did most of his stunts, I believe. Poor George Peppard, he died back in December of 1994 in Los Angeles, he was working on the sets for some construction projects at the time. Jim's career not to say doing badly, but he probably won't return the same popularity legend that the movie

drama and climaxes in a subtle though still dramatic way. I would have hoped for an alliance between Serrano and Billy Lee, but the moral is right rather than this never happening. Everyone was nice about this never happening, open discernable differences notwithstanding. In short I found nothing to dislike in this film. This movie crackle, unlike many that just seem nice. Sincere compliments for the director and all the other people who worked on this great flick. I am very happy that I am glad I was able to watch it. Also I want to applaud IMDb for coming up with a guarantee service to protect from people who linke in for nefarious reasons. I recommend this film to people who like movies of this genre and all pots of people since it is not unusual I found it to be an excellent film. Give a listening ear and watch if you have a chance.

though my father refused to touch the video without his knife at the ready. He was superstitious, and believed that crossing this line meant that there was a horrible ‘death’ ahead. And, without fail, these movies rarely disappointed. A good horror story is a great way to learn about the pleasure and terror of mortality. To help me remember these lessons I’d recited these scary movie quotes to myself until I felt completely confident in my ability to handle the pending danger. Now, I get to pass along this wisdom to children and youth and students in classrooms across the country. Horror movie quotes are so effective because they’re soothed with rhyming meter and catchy analogies that make it go down easily. I’m totally fine with that. I don’t mind putting the fear of God in kids. Teach an elephant man to fear the world, I say. They are big and potentially destructive and have lots of buckling teeth. That is a fearful image even for the people who love elephants. And of course, lots of people love elephants. Wouldn’t that be awful if only they knew the dangers? To only find out when its too late?

it any longer. Just completely pointless. I am so dismayed on what Europe has to offer us. Why are they always better and why are they always better than what we get in the United States? I never underestimated the Europeans before Zombi. It's not that I loved everything about Country B, but I never thought them more superior to Country A. A wake up call for me. But Zombi 2, absolutely awful. Luckily I had Battleship Potemkin to view afterwards. That was great. I can spot Tarkovsky's Pogranichniy sometimes in his film. I was so moved by that film. I cried at the end. Of course the costume designer is still my favorite in films and Tarkovsky was taking that into account when he made this. Horrifying scenes. Even horror, once in a while can be the best type of movie. If it makes people feel what they were in that movie. And it's true. Horror is the most effective genre when it comes to feelings you had when you viewed it. And I remember how great a horror movie made me feel, as a small child. But I digress. A horror movie I enjoyed since childhood was Deer Hunter. That's way back there. Nowadays I don't go thinking to horror with the exceptions of anything by Lucio Fulci or 
in this schlockfest, let alone attempting a performance. Featuring weird writing, strange direction and a completely off-kilter ending, this was hardly a treat. A logical choice in the Stephen King catologue because of its offensive scenes, but otherwise a complete loss. Do not see this film, not for all of the wrong reasons. A complete nightmare of infinite dimensions. No extant rating.

big movie. Not only bad acting and video but also terrible interaction and a terrible pushing format from scene to scene. The movie is a cross over thing ever first one was the frail birth of both the Infanto and the Raptor. flor only time I see the movies all that info is thrown away and never done again and the movies them get more and more insane to te follow up on ideas that were not very good in the first place. Oh well it the movie and other then a lot of people are happy. I am happy to see someone tried with making something like this atleast. I do love this movie troama showed about a ton of effrort and almost talent to what it would take to have a real movie transofrmer. almost a transfromer is not bad. If you are the all cheese on toast infanto shipping and your willing to bare a little bad premise and acting this can be a fun distraction. Watch from order who will have the Infanto romantics shipping it. If you know going in you will enjoy it! Awesome really. It is still the same movie but with an ending that makes your blow a gasket if you were hoping you would see the the movie and not have to get blown away like this lol. Hell even with a terrible movie comes great questions and who knows what else we will get to. These questions are going to be made awful hard to answer
eccentricities and schizophrenic fantasies. I would have liked to have seen a little more positive interplay with the men, so that bisexual fantasies aren't considered pathetic, but equally valid to a heterosexual relationship. (Alissa Lynn Y. Simpson) Moderator's comment: For other perspectives on this film, see notes at magatak's review of 'In & Out', reviewed on 1998-08-00. See http://www.davessite.com/videos/clint/inout.html. Please, write your own review here. so if I get something the least bit interesting that'll be cool (Thanks for sharing your perspective though.) I sent you an email. December 09, 1998 MY RESPONSE TO "NOT AS GOOD AS THE BOOK" by magatak While I greatly appreciate magatak's reasoned and intelligent review of 'FATAL ATTRACTION', I would like to share with all Dave's Movie Guide readers my own experience with the novel by James Dearden on which the movie is based. Travis shared magatak's Gina viewpoints, and rightly concluded that the character of Glenn Close's Alex needs an adjustment. I have a question for Magatak: What would you
establishment and pop culture in such groundbreaking works as Putney Swope, Greasy Lake, The Stunt Man and Down and Dirty Dollars (short film 1965), a pseudo-facetious "how to" guide based on a series of cartoons that appeared in the Village Voice. In the late 1960s, Downey worked to finish his film Tropico. Joseph Papp gave Downey a theatrical engagement for Tropico, and Tropico's distribution rights were acquired by Curt Foltz at New World Pictures. Both the film and the short film were released in 1969 to considerable critical acclaim. Curt used the short as a showcase for Tropico, which produced enough income to finance Downey's next feature film, No One's Fool. Curt went on to financing Downey at New World, which secured his subsequent films All the Marbles and the highly regarded Putney Swope. These two pictures were followed by Greasy Lake and Down and Dirty Dollars, both of which sold to British director Peter Bogdanovich's Warner Bros. subsidiary, Orion Pictures. Orion's acquisition of Bucky (1981), a critically-acclaimed portrayal of a Holocaust survivor, was Downey's third feature-length film for the company.
with the handsome charm of John Cusack in this romantic comedy. Sure they have played the leads in a whole bunch of rom coms and we all have gotten tired of having to watch them always falling in love with each other. They actually have this chemistry and the look in their eyes bounces it right back to you. It's completely endearing how they are constantly falling into each others arms and yet he is constantly grumpy and blunt while she is consistently cheerful and more polite. The constant bantering between the two is also reminiscent in the original while the movie does a great job in maintaining the feel of the first movie and still staying original and it doesn't come off as a cheap imitation. Director Rob Reiner really surprised me by this movie. I did not expect to him to be good at making comedies but he did a really delicious job in the funny scenes. I also love how they brought in the younger brother and cast Vince Vaughn in the role. It was such a refreshing chemistry to see with the brother sitting there listening and growing increasing disappointed in his brother for wasting a job opportunity with a prestigious producer. It was setting up for a little redemption and was slightly predictable. I love how in the first movie when they visited the home of the brother's fiancé they took a tour with the
find that Niccolo Castellucci’s direction and with it his mise en scene is not good enough if you don’t like fast-paced motion pictures… The camera often cares more about the tiny actions of Italian intellectuals than giving a good impression of the picturesque portions of the movie. I must confess that I had some difficult moments while watching it as I was left with idle confusion wondering what was going on. Also, Some parts of the movie give you the opportunity to spot blatant Biblical allusions (eg the scripture reciting room, where Titta meets the Cardinal and Irene) that don’t seem to do any stylistic and emotional good to the script. On the contrary, I do wish that Alejandro´s Almendros had worked with it a bit more freely in order to light the film correctly. As a final remark, I consider it utterly unfair to compare this film to Gianfrancesco Mancini´s „We Won´t Grow Old Together“, which is among the best Nino Manfredi movies ever made, even by the master of Italian bargain-bins. So no, Titta lunga fuori! Is not a nice film. Although it has some beautiful sequences (about Almendros) , die correct mise en scene cannot even make up the poor choice of the screenplay. It´s
I have been doing this for my non-esomecial therapy for quite a number of years now and this movie is astounding , yeah, right. This simple-ones a comedy. It's described on the tape case as a terrifying remake of the classic film by Deliverance, so filled with horrific violence that parts of it cannot be shown on TV. - May be the worstest buy in my entire life. I am sick of feeling guilty! I guarantee everyone else will despise themselves too, too. One of the most enjoyable movies, I suppose the only high rating movie that must give the movie a first miss view. You'll most likely love this movie, but the least-known actors made it worse, as some post cards: Devon Sawa or even Ray Liotta are terrible for having fun. Each part of this was built in such a way to make this brilliantly, thankfully, the digital technology has finally reached the right to and good judgment to make us enjoy SUCH sequels and images as these films have been able to offer the last few years. A good plot, very goose bumps. Terrific combination movie, great sense of humor and believing of dark ambience-quite recommended. Movie suits the faces of some Hollywood stars. Humane movie, which has no fantastic natural world. The movie, spent lots of time analyzing the ghastly nature of horror
, played by Sir Michael Redgrave, is quite bereft without the presence and understanding of his woman – so much so that he withdraws to the pub, whereupon the curmudgeonly landlord, played by Sir Ralph Richardson, refuses to wait on the old-mannish wastrel and other with scarred spirits. Even Adolf Caesar’s waiter – odd-named, much so – has his own prejudices to overcome. The film is vibrantly filmed and every laugh is well timed, incisive and often hilarious. It won four Oscars, including one for Henreid and Siegel, the other two for the music. You need to be in a good, light mood to take it all in and enjoy the jabs at German-American relations, English provincial manners and a small peek at some rather odd Anglo-Jewish practices of the past.

love it. May be haven’t seen Tonight we Live, but Tim Roth looks great in it. I wonder if you find you’re drawn to this genre mainly because you’ve got a shared interest in history. Thrillers and horror play second fiddle to it for me 9 times out of 10? 8 possibly after re-watching Cecil B Demented. So I guess historical action adventures is clogging my film funds (between action adventures and westerns) again which rather explains why I have zero disposable income. Anyhow, thanks for putting a lot of the details in your list – directors and studios for example. It is important to give details and credits for what the people behind the camera are trying to do. Although not great, Grant was trying to restore some depth and feel to a modern film genre (for the grandeur if nothing else). Unfortunately, Cary’s homosexuality makes his contribution into the Grand Dame of old Hollywood movies not what it used to be (while I know Andrew’s homosexuality has no impact on the quality or otherwise of his blockbuster spiderman films. Film makers and actors are under constant scrutiny from their fans so unfortunately this type of information is often (unfortunately) over represented in history as contributing factors to their films, sometimes for witty reasons like these) .. I suppose until double standards are
the opportunity to put together my first one-man film for this year's annual horror fest that I'm hosting. This short one will be a warning against taking over the position of head of the household when the white-eyed things with blood-dripping fangs pop out of his mouth. The film, after all, told by Ultraviolet Photography Studios, comes with this special preface to give people warning about what will happen whenever they take over the household and only causes hurt to their wife/husband and children: "I pray that this short film will teach people not to take over the household especially when they've just married their NEW wife. Please don't be biased, be practical. Listen to the warning signs. Beware when u're behind close quarters, innocent people will get hurt and get exhausted if u're freaking stupid. Don't try to prove the haters wrong. Honestly if you've just married, just LET the woman at peace and comfort her when she's sad and all the boys, especially Junior the ADA boy to have fun times with them and in the antics! LMTAO!" Anyhow, my first attempt, I believe, is a successful one. It's a genre film I'll be doing waaay more of in the coming days leading up to the first of November, and it's called "Ny
schooled, so I didn't have the full impact of the new crisis of the Reaganomics age because those new capital laws were confusing to most middle class workers. However, I remember always answering like a parrot, "It's a great day in America because there are no more welfare queens". Obviously, director Randal Kleiser was selling the overwhelming feeling of Americanism by trashing people in captial America who enjoyed benefits of a government welfare state. Thinking about America in a unique, deeper way, I knew the people I knew, who had to distance themselves from their poorer family friends did their best not to be looked into for their inescapabler, material concerns. Somehow, I thought it would bug Ronald Reagan and his militant comrades about this film. I wholeheartedly believe it couldn't escape the views of most people, even before the 90's Marxist riots and uprisings. It, being the most pure form of American revisionism ever expressed, was reprouted and thrown to the trash in terms of post 90's popularity. Actually, most films that express what The Wild Life 1972 did will always be crushed by the thunder of socialist barbarians. Without revisionism, we won't have American films. After Depression-era flick
it was creepy how Robert Wagner's character died and second, when I later watched Day of the Locust that bit of dialogue by Steve Allen being used to describe the movie - "Well, it's art, and art should be serious like life; and it's a little like life; it's about you and me..." has stayed with me ever since. And with this post and that line in mind let's watch: Female on the beach. Trying to show you some of the difficulties of being a wife and a successful novelist in Hollywood May 11/10/42. Written and directed by Elliot Nazarro. Starring: Melinda Moore/ Ruth Roman, Nestor Paiva and The Woman in the trunk. 32 minutes. The movie starts off at the Hollywood Sunset Building Office writing room of novelist Richard Condon and we find out he is at home on call with some dearly sick banker dying from bone cancer who wants Condon to dictate a chapters or so about a couple of characters he has been conceiving but not writing well in his novel in game? Yes a game! But that does not excite Richard very much because Jack Keys Richard wife is lounging and we find out she is an aspiring playwright who wants to to turn the experience in to a film script. They had a honeymoon together she confirmed
I am staying far away from this American remake of Wicker Man. But I googled the original movie and found that there is a new documentary coming out called Revisiting The Wicker Man: An Appreciation. It is narrated by Christopher Lee, the original Sir Edward Leech. I instantly jumped at watching this flick, but then found out that you have to wait until it is released next February. Boo. Sucks to be me. There is a trailer though: http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=9EfRKDTqOEc I hope for the sake of the new director (Nicholas Vince), that this documentary is actually interesting and worth a look. Until then, check out this fan made music video clips to The Lost Boys (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtB5RKYwAmM) and the Wicki Man theme (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvgI4mmCdGM). I don't know. Should be interesting. And if you're bored and wanna take a look at the actual trailer for The Wickerman, see the clip below...it's old school and VHS...but watchable: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQxFU5TM2G8 BTW,
in the lecture notes of my cinema and media studies course, but I'm not saying the guy would like me as a friend. Beautiful but brutal, Ossessione has a raw, dramatic energy and overall excellent cinematography, showing the same intense take on an ugly criminal underbelly we would find in a French gangster movie (Francois Truffaut acknowledges Ossessione's influence over Mr. Lucien Leuwen), of course. The subject matter may have been infinitely better suited to an American producer because once you get the Italian song-and-dance past the 42 minute mark, it's straight pepperoni pizza from there. Richard Basehart is compelling as a dim lout, pitted against a ruthless, relentless would-be police officer, but he can't quite overcome the filthy, brown aura of it all. Maybe it's the setting and the character's unusual past, but Last Breath is nothing if not hardscrabble. And as much as I try to stick with the game, and don't get bigged up about things that aren't really all that hardcore (As the Rain Falls, for instance), I can hardly resist a commercial-rate fetish video either. As it is, I managed to get a hold of Help Me Help
. This is the case of an elderly lady being stalked by a crackpot who would marry her if she let him and who gave a vivid speech about the virtues of bulls which I have stripped of the context (he means donkeys). I put this on in the belief there would be "pointy old people involved", and maybe I like hoary old coot round the rounds, it's rubbish. Listen. I would love Laurence Olivier to speak on this quality of video, the dinner scene is excellent (did he really eat so much at one sitting?) but she is so disappointingly bland. The love story itself is bloodless, and Alfred Lunt's performance as the brother is over the top, and can't think about the scenes he had with Gable without screaming in my head "It's teatime! Tea! Eggs! Bacon!" Still, it is worth it for that bullock speech. Also, "He's dead, Ike" - really, watching a zebra die is one of life's great sights and Gable's bizarre rhapsodizing about it entirely misses the point, but is still funny. Highly recommended as B-grade filmography.rnMagic, we call it, Ines. it is in all things. you and iRecent comment by XNC o1
ever seen. It touches my heart based on true events and how true enemies became friends throughout a difficult time in all of their lives (Iraq Battle). I view war as a tragedy more then a battle because of how soldiers suffer and how they feel throughout the events during the war. I look up to Sgt. Manny Ramirez and his quote that says, "Under my command die" to the Enemy. I admire his attitude because it says respect, honor, and faith to his country and foreigners. Although he dies in this film, by the end of the film I was crying because Manny lost his life at the end. This film has become a plague in my mind and it's something I can never forget! It has taught me many things about loyalty, unconditional war support, and emotional battles in between officers' lives. I don't support military! All you have to do is watch this film and you'll know what war is really about, the hate, and the loyalty! Thank you Hollywood, for making this film live on in innocent lives. Somewhere in paradise, God took his assistant and gave him a choice. "Do you want to come back and live with me?" And he said yes... Finally... Rest In Peace, Manny! Your mission has ended; my life will never be the same. I know why I fight... Because you overstand
well worth it as I got to see it American style and reclining in Disney California Adventure's huge theater in Disney's California Adventure. The movie begins with The Beatles playing at the famous Cavern Club in Liverpool. It transitions into showing how The Beatles started out as a life changing event for each young member. Money made from the a concert is used by Paul McCartney and he convinces John Lennon to get a "unique" building, which they do with the building of a huge piano in their home. The rest is history. I guess the next time you are singing in the shower as The Beatles, you can sing it as if they were singing it for you. I highly recommend you see this too. Not to mention it costs only $29.95 to get in and it is a definitely cool and you get to lay back too, so what more can you ask for. Rico Powell who is in charge of Disneys film acquisitions says the next movie in line, Sweeney Todd, is going to be very different than Dreamgirls and The Beatles. Actually it should be the opposite. The British count tells the story of a London barber who comes to America and has great revenge stories. Sweeny Todd has been adapted before so it will be interesting to see if Disney will get involved with adding music instead of going sequential with the music.
the story of Billy (Kelly), who has spent his life in the slums of New York. A poor-boy-made-good, some ten years back, something goes wrong now- as he is framed for murder. Escaping police, he skips town, and winds up on a luxurious liner returning to Europe. His singing and dancing sets things straight, and he wins the love of tough Broadway star Linedy (Leslie Caron). A wonderful satire of the welfare system, "Anchors Aweigh" almost makes one love the insipid song, "Make Your Garden Grow". As a modern work it sometimes seems dated (such as when Gene Kelly pinches an apple from a blonde) but this film actually has more to offer, to a new audience, than most musicals of the day. I love the dancing, it is done you may call, but of such quality as to make you overlook the flaws. At the same time the movie is not about dancing- except as performances to tap to. This is worth watching again and again. With all the musicals out there it is surprising this is not more widely seen. Although it was not in color (1945) much of it was shot in Technicolor. An "Inspiration for Steven Spielberg's "Hook"- it begins with the camera being drawn into Billy'
the characters as white as ghosts. The snare drum at the beginning is a jolt of reality; we know it means war. We follow the soldiers who press the buttons, that lift the plane off, and wonder how long the ghosts have been dead. Images of the devastation are naturally hard to watch. Not because of propaganda or political correctness, but because they dig deep inside our DNA, because it is basic instinct, to see a woman's hair burned off, or a man blown apart by shrapnel. War leaves a slimy trace of corruption in our souls. The film touches upon the atrocities of the war; the arms race, sick humans, the use of atomic power. 'When will the stupidity of mankind ever stop?' With a reputation fanning war time, the high court was never happy with the verdict. Harsher sentences were demanded; Germany accused. Nowadays, 66 years after the war, this is the only thing the MH17 trial in the Hague is about . But in Nuremberg you're touched by a beautiful melody, a lute. To defend himself, the German Chef of staff offered his skills as a musician. Here was found a network that was good at something, let that nonsense man play his flute again. His music remains the testimony of a generation whose march is over
Autism he is being threatened to buy out by another company, his assistant Ray ( Zahn who always wear his headphones, does a lot of duties around the laboratory and he easily controls Mark's madness away from the hospital) now just discovered the cure. Then he talks to two old friends, Dr. Kurtz ( Adams who plays all his roles with a big cigar in between his lips) and Dr. Ruth ( Zahn's wife) who tell him that is an idea that everybody has attached to the disorder, to the point, that scientist who discovered that Autism are added to the kid's daily medicine, Mark doesn't want to give up. But he is trapped in quarantine by Doctor Railly who has convinced the Media she is the real cause of Autism and now she is running for Senator. Mark thinks its madness just to save his grandson , until finally beats the virus and his grandson gets better. Then a young woman who is a patient comes strolling thru' was he thinks gives him more important reasons to be locked up. Instead was a dream, Dr. Ruth tells him. But Mark doesn't know it and doesn't care, he lived by idealism, lost a lot of his family and friends he didn't want the same to happen to anybody else, even to himself. A very interesting movie where we understand the madness in some doctor's
side and the human spirit,well it could have been a hell of a film if it had like 30 minutes instead of 80 or at most 90 minutes,anyhow Hugo Santosa evades the stereotypical stuff but looks like he would have succeeded if he had cut down the running time by half of the film's frustrating length. More then two hours movie seems like a can and we people expret a lotta cleverness in a cinema to accept such a context of fate. When an entire film is directed around the theme of stereotypical politically "correct" affirmation, where some wonderful scene goes against the whole film's stretched flow, then something's is all wrong. A truthful movie in the time here is always better then an honest one,I guess you have to be in the mood for affirmation not any other sort of stuff. It's a very optimistic film but if the last one in this group serves more points than the numerous many road movies already made,well then that should be a signal. It is sad that unlike the very successful works in this context of emotion films, this might be a "Do" or "Don't" for a wide range of audience looking for something real. If you are not on the look for a good road film and you find one of those "more than" anyone could wish for type of stuff then
of the best recent versions of 'Romeo and Juliet,' directed by Freddie Roman and featuring a young cast led by Christian Cooke and Victoria Justice as Romeo and Juliet. It was a fun film to get and it did a good job keeping my little kids interested. With their help in getting them interested and kept interested, I was able to have a good time watching the show. A+. 6/18/06 Can't decide whether to release my DVD copy before the next Romeo + Juliet...? It's a good movie, and it really just needs some good old fashion, no mp3, no film-out, just actual film, from the actual prints to the actual DVD. Then again, it might be good enough to be released instead of this stupid confession, confession, confession... You know what? I don't know what to do with this movie. I'm a huge fan of the classic, but the only one to offer a good overview is 'The Lion King.' This one was just too good to just resell, and I was expecting to be disappointed. This is the most successful transition of any live action film to Planet of the Apes. This movie is brilliant, with all of the latest movies in the original series taking place on the same WW2 setting. This movie is a must see for all die-hard apes fans.Also,the

film – but what it takes to be absurd and comedic at the same time is wholly dependent on whether the subject matter is palatable. It is a line that is being pushed by director Danish brothers Anders and Christian Bundgaard, and is especially relevant as they take over the reins of such a long and established film institution as SFX. Here, they tackle the viscerally controversial Danish/Iraqi themes, and the response to it is unevocative. What works best in this project is a humanist inhumanity, as it is not exactly violence that we are dealing with, but the sheer moral uniformity and integrity that rolls off the horny, well-intentioned dudes like slime from a venomous creature. What has been documented by by actual drones has got fresh depths now by the nasty humour by people who themselves should not feel a need to stand back and be the geeks that they naturally are. It’s a simple fact that I am not completely sure Anders and Christian really know the relation specifically between the Islam we all know and the Islam really gone wrong, which leaves the whole deer hunt comparable to a comedy in the vein of Vive la France. You laugh until you get a smack. It’s jarring. You can cringe. But would you not dare? Nah, you just did. You egged
, for one thing, originally inspired by the author’s own torrid affair/friendship/rivalry with the Count of Monte Cristo (the 1800s son of a noble Venetian family who emigrated to France, dabbled in the securities and commodities business, made and lost fortunes, studied law, returned to Venice as an enforcer for the French occupiers, married etc). The author was Alexandre Dumas, of course, which lends some gravitas. But back to the book: an affair with the glamorous but exploitative Camilla for awestruck Count Edmond is cut short when he discovers that she is involved in a greedy conspiracy against his own father that threatens their lives and Edmond’s livelihood. Embittered and humiliated Edmond, donning black and fastened by locks and chains to a cave, writes novels and devotes his life to schemes of revenge. Between scenes of vengeance he longs for Camilla (“What was she really thinking about? What was she trying to express, when she couldn’t?”) or forlornly contemplates the functionless cupolas of the Catholic churches he devastates as part of his rampage. “The count saw in the hundreds, in the thousands of ecru domes and balustrades the chessboard of war.”
Judith Eva Barsi (for whom I have a soft-spot because she is tragically deceased) and Lew Ayres (who I always had the feeling connected strongly to Ethel Barrymore) . A lot of flicks of this period sort of take themselves a bit too seriously. I normally holding a candle for comedies The Philadelphia Story and True Confessions, this one appeals to me above them. I feel it's probably because it's basically a take-off on nothing in particular and the whole cast is simply top-of-the-line. I first saw the flick when I was a mere 6. It's good for children but they have to understand it is not entirely conventional. From where I am philosphically the tastes of capitalism starts to remind me perverse rather than amusing (that shouldn't put people off) but, that's about the closest I can get while (presumeing to) enunciate a comparison of sorts without defending (any) preceived political constructs. It's my favouriite for the best streatch of time. I only "absolutley" love comedy set in a contemporary era. Too many movies get the supposedly "profound" by thinking their material if of course abortinal. To me it is refresing to see actors and actresses playing people of little "influence"
to every moment in All the President's Men. At the beginning you're just launched into the story with little feel of what's going on it's cryptic, but you seem to quickly catch on to what's going on. It has a Life of Pi quality to it, where at first you feel compelled, but then you lose interest when you're aware of the game already that is being played (though again it makes you realize how messed up our world is, and perhaps how good we'd be if at least this kind of thing were true). The language and thoughts of the seeker and the Nazarene, with some random children characters, is trippy, maybe excessive, but it does give you the dialogue of the seeker. Then the seeker meets the beloved (American beauty played by closed mouth Sarah Polley). The non judgmental psychoanalyst (actually autistic, self-determined, not diagnosed, self-conscious, sensitive, guilt ridden, good-humored, generous, silly and pleasant, would not respond to the pressed finger) - Heidegger seems to be sort of dropping hints and all sorts of nods to an idea that has been considered available before. The film opens with a very intense, dark musical theme that has powerful accompaniment, and concludes with sombre moments eventually morphing into rather heartening ones.

But aim is the move tells a story about brothers who killing people for money (Bounty rider), who has a very different view from the other bounty rider for the people used hypnotizing method to tricked the money but the other bounty rider who want to a huge money will not accept that method and the racists also threatening bounty rider who is not a slave ..The film has fits foot, decent cast, but I have some small problems about it such as bad script, and the fact that people full on a move to make some adventure with their family and animal. I know it is not a bad movie because there are some lady boy but i like the one to fight for her proprieter i think:) But I don think some action super duper did, also not as good as any movies which I like to first Wayne mason flicks,ллеfersson, Teeth & Blood and all online movies not illegal … I hope this movie was something amazing :) but it not as the rest of the movies I ever saw it is good but not good it is not bad just have nothing special about it. So this movie have some not posible way and things such as the Sombrero Hat that i love actually is Greg (John Cusack

on, they start to get a little short-tempered. Then Mr. MacKee turns up, looking for a bit of coffee. He is surprised to find the television on as he walks in. But his surprise turns to horror when he finds where the night is leading them. Mr. MacKee and the theatre manager agree that they need to turn off the TV. But then Mr. MacKee divulges the reason for him wanting the set off. Now the kids have to figure out whether to turn it off themselves, or make Mr. MacKee keep his mouth shut. Arguing or playing Monopoly: these are the best ways to settle things while those sleepover parties are going on. At least, that seems to be the only logic required here! After all, these are Massachusetts… er, Massachusetts ain’t Minnesota or something! Of course, with regards to people hitting ventures not having enough equipment… why, that’s just style! Award-winning director George A. Romero tells this MEAN spirited tale. It’s fun, but drawn out a little too long. Those of you with an interest in either horror or low-budget cinema will like this film quite a bit. Of course, fans of cult and arthouse cinema will certainly like it.

the Beatles- world which they lived in. The director of this film (dir: Danny Boyle) had showed the Beatles-preteen (1957-1962) and later onward it was well edited in order to create new techniques to show the effect of their great music."A Hard Day's Night" could easily be the worst rated film ever made in history- they made wrong decision of making it and later a few years later destroyed it but in a positive way. Now lets see the negative side of this film, the worst thing is that Ben Kingsley performance as 'Sgt. 'Ronald' (Anthony's age mate as Paul mccartney is nothing but worst and funny in the same time as the actor does not know how to pronounce his name. Also the fact is that the only actor that made performance like Ben Kingsley is John Lennon. John brought the sings in front of audience and sang them to make them strong which helped him to reach the top of stardom without helping anyone. In this movie Lennon is not allowed to sing as the role is given to John Lennon (which fits him well in the film) which you can see him editing and camatizingspeaking and then singing some Beatles's old songs on stage.Everyone knows that the Beatles songd which the idea of the upcoming film are very fun
went from topical political issue flick to a very blunt, unimaginative action noir that everyone involved wished they wouldn’t have or had to. Speaking with Kris Kristofferson and Danny Glover, I get the feeling they probably thought they were making a much slower, more cerebral Western and were disappointed that this wasn’t the case. Normally my hot/cold preference for this goes with the hot/feminine – written by Shane Salerno (Armageddon, are you fucking kidding me?), the female characters are the biggest failings here, while anyone played by John Sayles is always hot. The women range from Ciara DeFrancesco (the girls are into Dean Drive) to Elisa Donovan (Cooley High!). Morgan Griffin (as the wife of one of the activists, Kate) unfortunately looks the part she was given more than anyone. Sayles has seemed to give up on casting only looks and has begun to use powerhouses Elias Koteas (Peeping Tom, Thin Ice) and Thomas Kretschmann (Untergang der USA). Other casting includes Billy Crudup (Without Limits, The Cat’s Meow), Chris Cooper (Capote, Thunderbirds come under attack, September 17) and Ed O’Neil (Family Fidays nasty character,

Pretty good soundtrack with the usual suspects like Social Distortion, GBH, Anti-Nowhere League, Cockney Rejects, Stranglers,...There's some nice shots of San Antonio, Texas here and some scenery you won't forget. If the Swans movie is supposed to be awesome than this is a pointer just the same. This movie has not one, but 2 gang fights that surpass the Batman series from recent history.

have to give this film the highest praise. Not only is it a true story with an ingenious twist but I was drawn into the scenes and I can't believe the level of acting that was portrayed. Furthermore, I wanted to see this movie again as soon as possible. Very good indeed. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Well done and highly recommended. Fabulous acting, stunning scenery and tense moments. Great cinematography! This is a brilliant movie! The saddest part of this incredible bio film is so underrated by all. I loved it and recommend to anyone. If you like drama, joys & love this one will hit the spot. Andrew is the reason this film is great, he is unstoppable. A true gem! A very good film. Now, is not everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed this movie while watching. A true story. Dr Victor Marsh. Was devastated to see him die. True story. Excellent. Keep watching this and you won't regret it. You need to love this film. 10/10. Good story line, a lot of drama and great acting Brilliant biopic of Michael Glasscock, it certainly deserves to win several awards at this years oscars. Nick Carradine played the part to perfeccion! Don't miss this film as it will be the surprise of your year. also
Rachel Talalay's Telefon (1977). To be fair, it's not much worse than the original Thai version, which wouldn't win any awards. So if you can't afford the import from Thailand, at least this one from Uni is alright. However, can we have a choice in terms of buy-ability? It's DVD-14, region-free of course, but with only the PCM 2.0 mix in Japanese with English and Spanish subtitles. Sure we get 16x9 enhanced, over a decade after the original Thai version - granted - but other than that this release from the up and coming Uni label trails the regional releases by the likes of MegaFilm (Germany) and Presenttimes (Greece). I hear Media Blasters SkipChain plans a future Thai-taucing and sexycycling Uni release, but they might reissue this one as well. More likely they will find an excuse to lop off the credits and go in for the kill: Witness! http://www.screendaily.com/story.asp?section=news&story=19618. -dms 2/23/2004 5:39:51 PM 931626857t
really operatic. Again 90% of the movie takes place in a wooden cabin in a snowy forest. But, if you're a Ryuichi Sakamoto fan, you will like this hauntingly beautiful music sung in Chinese instead of Japanese. it is somewhat operatic. What do I know, I just like it. Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker speaks in a weird melody, the way he speaks, I feel like a lot of the time he's singing with his voice the way he speaks. Werner Herzog follows his fearless style, he wrote the screenplay as well. There's one scene where Harker ravenously eats his plate of food, then he vomits it up immediately, and it was shot in one take. Herzog was sick, he was obsessed with maintaining a realistic tone even if it meant putting himself in harm's way. And no, it's not opera. There's an orchestra playing, there's a high level of synchronicity to the orchestration/acting, it's very operatic in presentation. But, operatic in its goal and execution, not opera in its execution. Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe watch it. Or don't. It's the 80's, it's horror, it's not for everyone. It'
, turned on to their marvelous 1948 film When the Bough Breaks by Alex Smoke (AKA the late Russell Brand) who played Basil Fawlty in the splendid remake of Fawlty Towers, since purchased (20th century Fox) in part by John Cleese, I made it a cause to see the movie and learn what there is to know about the particular brand of hijinks espoused by such luminaries as Eric Sykes, Leslie Phillips (star of Stanley Kramer’s It’s Brattleboro and many subsequent Peter Sellers comedies) and the perennial Jack Warner; after all, who doesn’t want to see how comedy was done in a certain era without the institutions of obscene and disturbing social behavior that have long since run amok in our pandering and time-sucking pop culture?

(Tom Hanks) is the patriarch of the family. He wants to make a good life for is family, especially his daughter Annie (Zoë Saldana). Michael loves Annie dearly for a little reason –she is the only child he has. Unfortunately, that would change. The beginning of the movie welcomes the audience into the reason for the movie. The camera the hover over the city, the movie is set in the 1930s perhaps. From a slightly higher up view, and zooming, you can see Michael Sullivan talking to Frank Nitti (Jason Butler Harner) on the phone about a job. Normally he is a trash collector, but Michael’s obvious superior knowledge of formal business with no experience was evident. Just as quickly as Michael agreed to the job Nitti asks Michael to do something for him, which was essentially taking out one of Nitti’s rivals, Johnny Knoxville (David Dastmalchian) The problem is that Michael knows the rival really well, as he was from Sullivan’s old neighborhood. The shots change, the camera now focuses on Michael as he talks to his family, mostly his daughter Annie. Then, if you look at them, you can see the slightest of recognition. Michael was starting to become that cold, heart-less person and just a worker for someone else, as opposed
Massacre in a smart, remote mansion – or Tudor house – by people in animal masks; just some extra scenes and a different actor ‘Breakfast Club’ style college students to fill out the plot, a terribly dumb plot at that. Part 8 is out now and presumably they’ll be another one soon. Cue the other 25-year-olds mucking it up just as badly. I didn’t mind how dumb some of the movies of stupid teenagers going and getting killed in deer masks or the more soul-searching preachy ones up to today were, since even the wheels on these crammed-with-U-S-identity self-parody car chintz franchises come off before the end of DTV sequels. But this kind of stupid gets on my nerves. That’s what makes it truly clueless: the “tackling-serious-social-issues” washing its face under “just-taking-heads-off” bull-story. Incendiary family, sexual problems, spicy date rape are twigs – the root is choosing material too broadly for keeping things fresh. But also through jokes – some of the recent macho man-child have had reasonable writing, production values, performance and were at least dire fun/intentional. This isn’t. It
saucer in an "interplanetary zone." In 1967 the British Eagle Comics issued a comic-strip story involving "a modern and decorated Adam"--its title was Genesis--who creates the Eve character by mixing his DNA with that of a monkey and a lizard, pushing her head-first into Adam's rib chest cavity. This isn't supposed to be furniture in the generic sense; instead, when we're at the table closest to the sword-wielding gardener, our building blocks are not wood but RNA. This is the nerve--the fatal mistake, the emphatic return of God--to al-Ghazali's disapproval. When we are outside of God and find ourselves inside God---only to be both at once, in terms of the swordsmiths among us---this is effacing the differences between us and everything else. It is as inexplicable to us as how humans are supposedly morally different from wolves (or elephants, or rhinos) in areal view: it is a problem of ontology and semiosis and the urge to know, and ontological problems are the eternal source of an exalted sensibility. For the traditional Muslims, this is a grave issue: after all, if one is God, then why are things snows and wolves after you
humor, cheap one-liners, and mathematically improbable situations, and the whole thing becomes a chore before the credits even roll. I liked them but it's time they stop the force-feeding. Luke needs to stop hanging out with Carrie and if he's a Jedi then he needs to stop laying on the floor, lying to his masters, and nearly needlessly sacrificing himself. In the end, this was fun from an action standpoint but not nearly as funny or engaging as the first one. Last 15mins had to show they could do it in 3d and it added nothing to the film. Leave it alone. 480p/ 300p dual audio, 4.3 GB download. Sit back and laugh yourself silly. Justin Timberlake’s comedy timing is the best part.

but for some reason, and I can't name which, I don't like it. Most probably for it's too much style and superficial "brilliance". It took me second viewerman to enjoy the last part, but at first I was bored. It is not the most exciting film, but the most-awarded. "I should like this film" and sometimes I do. I think I'm just in a habit of the mainstream Washington-Stoner-Simitatacters. I need to watch "Rashomon" now as "Kwaidan" too. The last one is supposedly my most favourite film. I almost cannot name a second one like this. Thank you. You raise awareness to Japanese films. I have got to love them, and never was so mindful before. The way of Kyuu is different from the rest. I believe it reminds in some way methodical Siebel (I bow to his sweat and blood, liters upon liters required to finish his films.) Nature, wild and natural. The lack of jokes and happy endings.

Well done. Is it even too late to just repeat the horror of Penthouse and Playboy magazine's flopping parties? Is something about the celebration of the end of scary nightly hide 'n seek knock knocking down the final curtain? I would have said the same about the crash of the Titanic. Did the movie in question have to include being caught on film breaking out into displays of choreographed swimming (it gets so watery....), and had the same purring steam-train original score thing like any bad CGI new ground it's trying to melt through is hardly poetic?

at developing his characters, making you take sides and face yet more dilemmas as to who to like or who to despise. This has been a huge box office hit world-wide, and should also win plaudits for what it’s actually about. It’s actually about child abuse, the horrors children go through at the hands of those who should care for them, and is as hard hitting as any of the recent news stories we hear about. Performance-wise, good too, although we will have to see who will win an Oscar nomination amongst the cast. Mark Wahlberg and John Goodman are not known for their performance in this kind of film and yet step right up to the plate and nail their parts. Melissa Leo is absolutely outstanding and is the star here. She’s good enough to come in a strong second to Best Actress! This is a fight, and even if you don’t like to see it voiced, the writer has a big mouth and will voice it however he has to for you to wake up. You will either (a) not watch, (b) see but walk out (or insert naughty word) and go somewhere else, (c) watch and move from angry to very upsetting, as I did. Only you can make that choice. And you have to make the decision not based on grizzly or nunnery scenes, just on watching.
Gladiator, Meat Loaf and snow in the north mostly, and that's not enough. Only 45 minutes long, and it felt WAY longer for me. Should be funny, if only for Fresco's fumbling, odd breaks in character and trying to carry the weight of an entire mortal plotline. Really sticks out, too. Would be ideal if he sped it up to a quicker pace but I don't think they'll. They stay around just long enough that one forgets they have original plans, but still not long enough. I feel like the original actresses could have done about the same job in similar circumstances. As for Luke Percy, it's kinda hard to say whether he's new or not. They aren't harping on his acting skills or pretending HE's Lewis Hart. Second episode should be more inclined to prove any of it, though. Will they be able to recover and improve? Totally worth one more go, but you gotta wonder with 1 episode for every primary build-up player. It's all been done before! And brilliantly!

a lot of watching to do). The first and very important thing is that we're not being fooled at any time it's a proper exit from Hammer Ltd. after their good days. Back then studio was sued by Quatermass producers over the unjust use of the name. And Amicus simply dared to go farther - they not only directed name but placed it at the centre of the whole stage, creating the Big Six-esque brand for themselves. And even Ellen decided to lend her blessing to the new band. Not going to lie, it felt really fantastic when their first song came after the title, using that scene from Hammer's famous trailers. Rather spooky they frame "Can't get enough of that Hammer Horror". And there are four episodes! Good god! Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! And speaking of things from Hammer, I was most surprised by the Hammer-styled fx. Too many times have these companies gave us disgusting, silly and downright embarrassing monsters, so when I first saw the heavily unnatural movement of Terence's head, I didn't know what to expect when I'd see the monster from that nightmarish angle.

childhood! Perhaps the poster of liquid uranium could have impacted that. I was too young to know what it is, and I do remember thinking it was unusual (and perhaps kiddy-literature version of a nuclear waste drum). Luckily I was able to find the boxed set via Amazon for a very reasonable price, in good condition, and thank goodness. I pictured it as the treasure box that piece of mind would be. Yes, we all know my childhood memories are wrong, and no adult would be more pleased to learn of this series than me. The fifth book features a danger I've not thought of in my other musing-Fleshmort! I wish I could've quoted more of it, but my big plan to just type up the entire dialogue of the scene with the Fleshmort was too expensive for my dad to help me with, and when I did type it up I forgot an entire chapter. Oh well, there's another thing my childhood has forsaken me on! That's the thing about fond memories, they're always better than the reality. I prefer the better story. I so badly want to go back in time and tell my younger younger self about the proper obsession it should be, when it's time. I love it that I adore this book as much as I do, because it speaks to my tr
being the after credits scene. It feels empty, it's weirdly shot and the ending is kind of a shambles. Take 10 years off Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Lewis and it may have turned out better. The other performances are solid, same with the music, this film isn't the work of an amateur, the budget ain't small and yet somehow it's an awful film. Seemed hamstrung by studio interference and by groups that just don't understand the horror genre and never have. It doesn't have to be bloody, it doesn't have to be over the top special effects or over the top actors...though it should be well acted to work as a film. It's just done wrong, so wrong. It joins Interview with the Vampire as a film that really would have benefitted with a low budget. I'm gonna fearlessly say it MINK, you're thrilling desire to do this ended BADLY. Too many cooks in the film making process...same old same old sadly. Humpty Dumpty walls are rebuilt each and every time this excuse to opportunity is done. Small cast away from big budgets. Then Hollywood does what Hollywood does...preys on the gullible public. Sad. Eminently sad. I'll not post the untrailer here...it's horrible....

Sorry Zajac but you are just AWFUL! :P:P:2:dunno: My babbey YEAH RIGHT!! :P:P:P:D:D:D:D Just kidding! There...logically...could...be...plans...with Twilight, but by the last episode it is sooooo obvious. I have made "notices" about the show b4. Such as Edward vampyre bondage? Noticing they look like any @#$%?) werewolves except we give them credit for being puppies. They have no clothing, so how are they going to carry around enough muscle meats. and poor clothing :guffaw:, besides they run all over Bella's house, I see it, not very safe. When they were at school with rather notionable clothing, very classical. As cameras were filming they just started running and there were tree branches and other things in there eyes GOFF, and made the muscle meats appear too distorted and such! Ridiculous! The clothing was nice, but it went away
The whole movie was boring. The ending was terrible too. The only good thing about this movie was the jokes. The jokes were funny but I don't think that justifies the film being considered so bad. Don't watch this. Tons worse movies I've seen.PROS: Pretty funny.CONS: Boring and a pretty bad movie. Sorry Al... You deserve better.8/10. Mediocre at best. Full Review by Caleb Miller ( who feels totally different but likes the review ) .....A nice Entertainment.Al pacino is so good at starring these kind's of movies. He is the movie and the verbal dances delegate to him . Nice acting. It was a joy to watch!!!.Full Review by Kuldeep Daniel ( who feels totally different ... ) .....Better than you think.....Al was merely making a movie, and since in the process he decided to share some of his methods with the viewers, it is up to the viewer whether to watch and listen attentively or leave the room like an unrully class during the film's production. I resemble Al Pacino. I think that laughter is good for the soul.An entertainment movie about phone sex business, director is Joe dante. Al Pacino is the cast main actor. Tila Tequila is the cast main actressAl
Tombstone. I figured here I was gonna have a good movie. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed as the movie was poorly written and poorly adapted. Holding out for a Page Biggers novel selection, unfortunately, there was nothing. Well, I did get my wish of seeing a movie which is adapted from a book. Since the book is never released in print form and available only for purchase on the internet, here is a review of the book, In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash. The title of the book is a running joke/reference to the few early American scripts (Goonies, Addams Family, etc). Now for the review. This is a medical drama that follows a young surgeon in his tale of learning to start a medical facility. In the book, he and his wife, Lucy, marry, have five children, a son, Sam, who becomes a lawyer in Iowa (Andy Granger), and a daughter, Mary, who falls in love with a drug salesman man, Harry Gillson. The wife dies of tuberculosis and the daughter dies in a horrific accident. The rest of the novel follows the doctor, His name is not Bryan Mills, but Henry Higgins and the plot could be made into a Robin Hood tale. Anyway, the doctor with the help of his Customs agent friend from Brooklyn, Paddy Sklutskie, tries

I liked this so much that right after I had finished the entire show, I watched the entire show again. Regina Hall, 48, is a mother in the third season. But why had they reserved two ballroom suites for two highly competitive Wen-Yi schools that only worked along with the Double Cross? Every episode was better than the last. Did she see this Martial Artist and stare at him for two episodes? My Dad who was born in 1952 loves the show so much he sends me the DVD’s as a present every year for Mother’s Day! That’s when I realized he looks like Scott Jansen and I started watching again. Accept that and make the most of it. Why did Nicole date Freddy for a while? Before the kiss, he stares at Ally with all of his intense eyes! No matter how successful you are, you can still develop insecurities about everything in your life. Oh g
let orlando Bloom understands the script the story ends here. I like this ghostbusters a lot. (laughs) and I think it made a lot of girls like me, a lot of girls that would never have seen Ghostbusters, a movie like it. "And now it's giggling during these moments where the guys are still doing their best." But it also makes me sad, too, because this was the moment when women were no longer afraid of these old movies. This was the culmination of 25 years where women gather around a movie, but that moment is gone. So then you think what could happen with a movie like all the men? We are talking about dropping a new R-rated tag. We also need to accept the fact that it doesn't exist anymore. And if you are not confident in a script, then it should always be changed so that it works for the voices of the actors. See ya, the donald as fans of the PM has given Ryan Gosling A Tough Time here. (Log in here: a look back at the year of... (and it made me happy, but it also made me sad.) With all due respect...

able to predict which fetuses will be born with a certain disease. He takes the fetuses from these genetically damaged children, mixes them with normal tissue, and injects the material into mice in the lab. Take a moment to consider the ethics of this. Now imagine that he is using previable but fetal children in the research. At what stage of development? What if he’s destroying the foetus to get the tissue instead of preserving its whole? What if he has actually killed his research subject by injecting the pubescence or sperm, because pubescence or sperm also contain genes. What if even his consent is no real consent for others not able to reasonably assent or understand the importance or the implications of preserving the future citizens of the world is a social contract? how much can society morally forbid such an issue? What if his consent is no autonomy, and he’s being manipulated in experiments where even his body is against him -because, after all, the concept of a trisomic gene occurs in humans, and we 99% of us fall in the normal category - what really makes this question more complicated is that the more we know about life, the more we realize that we’re nothing miraculous, nothing special, nothing more complex two chemicals, a ferromagnetic iron inside us that reacts to its environment and
have been hamming it up like a sh*tty B movie production. So you end up with something in between, and that's a pity. It just could've been, well, funnier. Still, thanks for Eva Green being in it, that makes for a lot of pretty fantastic onscreen Californian female scenery. Outside of that, not much really reels me in beyond an okay execution of the story (B movie plot and all!). I'll admit a broken nose is pretty bruisin', but a busted lip is nastier. And the right one at that! Wolverten, spaghetti, marinara sauce, al dente. Meanwhile, the movie's gotten a pretty simple-pain-in-the-$\$$$ renewal, thanks to the sky-high and ever-growing rental rates for 3D and IMAX screens. Image Technology still uses projection technology that completely ignores any other shapes than round, so why not? Also no speakers in the next row can sit down. (My kind of show!) Oh, and while you're not likely to escape with an iron claw or drift over to New Zealand to pay homage to the game, I gotta say this is a pretty nice teaser. I'm sure I haven't seen the whole story, but make it more R rated, throw Wolverten some
translated into English if I went to Vienna. That sounds like a wonderful class. Translating from old German or Russian into English is kind of like when the English invaded India. The English invaded India and over two hundred years they got along and kind of adopted some of each other's culture, but they did manage to learn new ways of making tea and inventing perfect curry. Then they returned to England, being the elite. To this day when the English go to India they plan their tea time one year in advance, or as we say, they plan and know their destination. But they also know they will have a very different taste in tea then they have always been used to. As for the Indians in England, those, second generation Indians, don't know how to act in England because they are Westernized and don't use much spices and can't get their hands on authentic Indian food. So the real challenge is with the Indian in England as to what to get into that authentic Indian experience. Yet, all native English speakers love curry and tea so much they can't get enough of India's food outside of India. And they crave to travel to India to experience authentic Indian cuisine and tea. More then. I have to admit English food is not authentic. Yes. Their food is... I was going to say "right" but I'm not sure that's the word. It's
Every riot and stampede from the trail to the saloon seems a retox of the last. A woman's past and future are reputations outside the boundaries of "woman" that transform her from a social image to a social symbol She's an image of a woman, but her popularity is one of endeared hardship. She's dramatized for what she risked or endured. The edges of her life are pocked by violence and her frame is marked by pain. Her integrity and will come from defiance and resistance, this came forth most in the videos. The women are marked as the East-Coast, what we may dub "Broadway", for they escaped most of the violence, but embraced the surrender of losing her propriety, for who, when then, is our new Lewis and Clark of re-navigation and connection. She is Rebecca, but now we'd like to know her name. She is Arabella, but now we'd like to know the ways she handles her tricks. She is Pocahontas, but now we'd like to know how big is the space between peace and danger? The West is dead, that's no controversy, but this, the interest of image and industry today, is where she carries her past to a new Pacific. The direction tracks, from the patterns in the link, our art curated into
how the law was abused. But ultimately, the lady gets life in jail. This was a movie about how a woman is looked at by others. That the ALL the perceptions of her are flawed and misguided. That is the point of the movie. But they left out the media point of view which is the story was presented without any emotion. the tone was smug. Unfortunately, the "Life lesson" taught was that the incarcerated get no breaks. When the jury decides the verdict is Death, 65 minutes before it was given the dumbest return verdict you can imagine. The movie should have portrayed the misunderstanding of ol'Bootsie in a more human way and less like a stereotype. The movie seems to say the only significance of the trial is that a death sentence be given. I don't believe this one true. This movie would have been much more powerful had it expressed the physical, mental and emotional toll that prosecution takes on the parties involved. Additionally, if the director was going to take sides, that side should have been to the woman. See it for yourself but I think you'll walk away with the thought that a word like "I" other than "I am guilty" was not used during the trial, nor in the inter-view. Also, the cast seems to have been written and the scenes forced and not natural

as were the ongoing character arc that is the bottom line of most Altman works. But I found it a little flat and I think that's because I don't really give much thought to the LA Society of Preference in the first place. I'd catalog this as one of the worst films directed by one of the best due to a lack of anything new said. I can be redundant, directing my views toward others. "This is it, drive-in style" the film says at one point. The grungy grit of Abrams' "Spielberg" and the artistic hail-a-taxi of "Malkovich, Shallow Hal," sure to draw interest from audiences of both rails. Scored by Julianne Moore and her current pop band Broken Telephone Loose Wire (thaw in Finland nudniks), the girl band is to the forefront of intellection for several of the characters pictured on screen. Rousing stuff from usual suspect Altman, the final act is best bet. Strong lakefront party spirit.

but just barely (didn't make it to ten for another month, which explained the frantic wheezing as the house caught on fire and poor Dr. I. COGG missed me); the movie was titled On ne meurt que deux fois (no turn-offs when you're twelve). The funny thing is, i really Liked this movie, which is also quite strange, coming from the likes of me: i liked it a lot. I remember, amazingly, almost the entire movie. I mean, EVERYTHING! It was about two cops, legends of the underworld, i forget their names but they were played by well-known French actors: D publishing de AA. and T publishing d RN. All kinds of things went on between them: every move was a revelation, and i was enthralled. A RIOT ensued when both the body of one and the head of the other were discovered in the same truck, dumped at the same time; as if one guy's been engaged in all kinds of illegal and indecent activities on the one side of town, and the other on the other side of the same town, which the terms of the felon's probation strictly forbid, so inevitably, they come to blows, in some tiny, suburban cafeteria that looked and smelled like everything was from about
middle school. My brother used to call it 'Moon Man' because the moon guy is never shown. Frank's a moody guy who forces his son to drive him around. The son decides to buy a put-put that Frank always wanted so now Frank is put-put happy and everyone is happy. Live Free Or Die Hard was a fun diversion although I wouldn't put it in the same league as Die Hard. Won't Get Fooled Again quite honestly makes Rush's With A Little Help From My Friends sound like Manfred Mann's Do Wah Diddy. I imagine that Sons Of Anarchy may have some biking parlance but it's just the adult version of Wild Hogs without the contrived script writing. Rambo is predictable but still effective. I actually kind of enjoyed Zeppelin in my youth but I guess it's cheesy to some who it was made for. H+ was good with the political corruption. Rig had enough action to overcome some slow parts. The Wonder Years is another matter. Ever watch one and be just bouncing against the couch. They don't make these kinds of television anymore. Great show! I'll check out Children of the Corn V some day. Does Walking Dead count as horror? The 5th Kind was alright. Do not rent Custom Frenzy. OMG

moral plumbing as this one!! We certainly live in strange days!! It curious that they get in a tizzy about immigration yet 20 years ago nobody seemed to mind that Joe Queenan, the nutty white Irish fella (I think has British citizenship ) had a hit song about sending all these Mexicans back!! Did anyone here anything from the Hollywood crowd denouncing him as abject racist cutely so or were they more worried about getting a hold of him so they could use him for one of their pompous pet causes? And 30 odd years ago there use to be harmonicas at the door of every home on Independence Day praying for rain, hence the green skin! Difference between a joke and a joke is        this: research everything : It also seems to be several hours with the sound turned down, except for large chunks of dialogue. and mutilated landscape scenes: In 1985 there would have been no reason to not include Joe Queenan's spoken word "We're Moving The D
the mise en scène and the cinematography – variable ambient light, deep focus and an appropriate use of close-ups. The voiceover seemed unnecessary although it added to the art deco feel of the picture, almost visually expressing an incorporation of the technical into the more artistic forms of expression. Paying homage to Melies and the early film pioneers, it almost has the look and feel of an old, silent cinema classic. The acting was a little stilted and the cast didn't fully embody the quirkiness but neither was this distracting to the overall feel of the film. I must admit, I was irked by the faux-naif presentation of the musical notation at the beginning and was surprised to learn that these musical passages were by Alexander Scriabin rather than being a pastiche. So I decided to do some further reading on Scriabin and his musical transformations which appeared to deal with the organic/physical realm of existence versus the other side of existence, the spiritual realm which is what I saw when looking at these images. Ultimately, then, the music and the film appear to have a common theme which elevates it above the simple cartoon. I seem to be unaware however of the impact of Scriabin's life on his output and the following would be appreciated with regards to elaboration of that: [Random fact: there are so many interpretations of
accent. Not really bad but you know... she was just awfully funny. I would say Forest's performance was brilliant as well and you could feel helpless sitting there watching him try to figure out how to save himself the whole time. Brilliant movie! I've loved this since I first saw it when I was a kid and this time I came away feeling that it was as good as I remembered. I hope you enjoy it too! Great movie! MistrSnapshotFanUSA 20:57, 14 April 2007 (UTC) . + 5/5 stars!834ottscott123 08:47, 24 June 2009 (EDT) I loved this film when I first saw it at the time it was released, and it is even better in my view today. In my opinion it could have just been as much a comedy as a horror film. The hi jinks with the poison stamp being pressed and even with the Aunt, had me laughing so much and for so long, I wanted to watch it again. All the characters are all too human. Both themself trying to help each other in different ways yet afraid of what each other would do next and still they loved each other. The real acting performance that made me love Forest as a person is when during a sequence of his frustration and loneliness over F

as exceedingly polished. At times it has a very polished look and feel. Yet, the actors do take a few dips over acting in what will eventually become a blend of classic zombie/slasher flick. It’s genre light and the few special effects in the film are the most extreme slides that I’ve ever seen with the actors sliding across the screen. However, that does not take away any enjoyment of this film because it is a lot fun to watch. The story is a very classic Low Budget Flick. This is probably the PLOT, along with more than likable zombies for what comes out of this feature. However, one that we being to analyze, you will see that there isn’t a lot of plot in this feature at all. Exalted script, however, that is very enjoyable. The Performances in this film are very commendable. Tasters of this, and he’s not a believable hip Rap artist. There are some of these sitcom performances just including an actor, put them near a camera, and act like they’re usually expected to act. However, some of these actors, like Clint Holden, avail themselves very well, and are just delightful to watch. All of these are low budget flicks, so their biggest credit going in is that they needn’t be the majority of annoying to watch,
fun since my first screening of Incredible Hulk! It was really awesome. The last time I saw the movie was just after seeing the midnight screening twice, and I knew it was a blast so I walked out absolutely pumped up. But it was no hype this time -- the hype was the effect of the movie itself! All I could do after the preview screening was yell elated "WEEEEE!!!" Again and again! That's how happy I was. Here are a few screenshots from the preview trailer. You have been warned! They spoil a great scene! You already know from the dailygame site that this gorgeous lady plays Ava, who should not be trusted at all, and she looks awesome in the previews: =) Take a look at those ninja assassins taking on Thorpe and his colleague. Awesome group action! Wait till you see the whole movie! Then I went to another screening of Solaris after leaving Red-eye. It was supposed to be the premiere, but director Steven Soderberg wasn't there. I read an interesting article over at dvdactive about what happened to Solaris online and if there is a a DVD version of it, but that's not what I'm here for. 2 minutes into my Solaris screening I was thrown out as a most unwanted immigr
large numbers of mistakes and inaccuracies. I would exclude the few obvious mistakes which have been – as you must – taken into their own account. Is it saying some thing about our celebrity culture that a movie necessitates any comment on how inaccurly it depicts the Beatles? Usually, a movie’s depiction of its topic is a commentary on its society’s social beliefs, about how the cinema audience believes the people we consider as heroes, loved ones, friends, acquaintances, or celebrities. In this circumstance, it’s clear there were two separate issues on the minds of a lot of folks (including actors, directors, producers) when they began working on Began All over again: the 40th anniversary of Beatlemania and the passing of George Harrison. On the basis of several misguided opinions, Began All over again is exactly about John Lennon. Not about Paul McCartney, George Harrison, or Ringo Starr. Lennon was more likely the focus of Began All over again because of his earlier collaboration with the director, Michael Winterbottom (and his friend and representative, Johhny Kite). The film’s primary mistake is to focus on Lennon and his life and ideas. Though he really didn’t hesitate about debunking religion, he felt they had been correct about the syntax, connot
EVER! And aside from Firefly the same goes for sci-fi shows. I mean Xena used to strike me as ridiculous since she had captured more evil warlords than Batman,but she was infinitely more nuanced and interesting in all the opinions I read about different shows. For Buffy and movies like me love wallpaper ideas Xena I just remember laughing and not really caring to know any details be they character traits,official version of events. or foreshadowing opinions. So instead I spent years studying implausibility and production,but I enjoyed them regardless. While I probably wouldn't spend next to no time watching these shows, I would definitely rewatch at least the first couple of seasons of both Buffy and Angel (who at least sounds cool). I mean all romance comics by animefansdorama can replace the english wording with japanese wording (each character has just as densely clad characters on spanish. buffy the series is a little more realistic in terms of costuming and hair but still extreme...check out the short movie digital faceoff reminded me how I had a couple tries writing a little fanfic but I stopped because I wasn't sure how.

be as good as it actually is. If Tom Selleck had been good in the 1st one, he is spectacular here. It was so good, I re watched scenes thinking what a magnificent job he has done. Lack of believability in a couple of the scenes serves to to enhance believability in the majority of them. Its non prostitutes scenarios offer a more tasteful view of reality than their scenes, which have been replaced by drunks and debtors chasing Linnet (Laura Albertson) around. The producer Bob Mitchell was duty bound to deliver a film for the financial people, but, pleasingly, he has really delivered something with historical and artistic merit. Its quite civilized although Selleck walks out of the saloon after his brother (Donnie Kessee) is killed, and rightly so. I was pleased with Jake issuing a challenge to Tom Buttles before he joins Li Banner and the piqued Buttles comes to the window to join the challenge and gets his shoulder torn out by an angry Jake. You could feel the tension throughout the film, so many times I expected Jake to draw. The guitar tunes with Rebecca Sweet are so well synchronized to the scenes. Sam Propstra is a great character, and his relationship with Quint Asper is heart warming, it actually was in real life,
some good villians."  So, all it makes me want to stop watching and never watch again?  Pass.  Rather than simply portraying the movie as a whole, a unique form of review would be to show six or eight segments, in apparently random order. The likelyhood is that a movie would be as perplexing and seem absurrd as one of the three books by Stephen King I've ever attempted to read. Like being shown just a minute of the legs of running feet -- thump, thump, thump.  My favorite line -- "He'll kill you!" -- delivered by a very young Kate Bosworth.  Lastly, the actors in this movie look like they are watching a screen somewhere that shows us exactly what they are doing  and which sounds like the voice actor Henry Staples did for the video game, "The Red Yard."  Does Imaginary Properties own the rights to the movie, the book, or both?  Does Amazon own the rights to this review?  If either is the case, I would think both would be happy to let it go.  2208 total characters  Why is she still alive? <
that these so-called characters had to say was merely a rant. The actor was incredibly good looking and had good delivery of his lines. Although I am a Christian, I feel I wasted my time. Thank everyone that is posting negative thoughts about this movie. And so this is it for my first post. LOL!

I am not a film snob, though normally films remakes of movies I didn’t care for, do not interest me, I make an exception for this one. The original film, was originally serialized in a magazine by Dashiell Hammett as Red Harvest, in 1929, where is became and instant success. It marked the switch to writing hard-boiled fiction. This why you should not come into it expecting it to be a remake, this is the first of his detective novels featuring The Continental Op, and the only one of particular interest. The first paragraph of the original novel, is a real sentence creator. Hammett does provide musical to some of writing over its 182 pages, and both the shooting and movie are called Red Harvest. As with many novels and screenplays, especially in noir, and the themes in Red Harvest are, slummy factory owners prey on the workers, crooked, city officials,police forces, being connected to the fictional King Mob, who favour political corruption over societal good. Within this fictitious Boardwalk fighting for power, between two criminal gangs of Moose-hide men, the Paughs and the Hindus. Hammett says, The book takes off from a gun battle I once saw in a western city where it started in the morning and they were still shooting at one A.
English. Canadian accents with a french foreign dictionary acting as happenstance dialogue. "Excuse me, mon cher..." if, you're lucky. Gorgeous scenery and tight directing, matched with relaxing classic french music à la Manon by Clementi, which the director said was first on his list of potential musical scores and he was delighted to be able to get orginal instruments to use in his film in it's place. Romantic, poetic and cautious, at the same time more than I ever thought it possibly could be. Everything is completely in it's place and has been done before, but all that aside it stands is ground as it's own entity. It fits it's quality with a continuation of controversy that the french judicial system has always had, that being what happened to Guy and the other people that took part in the May '68 student protests in Québec.

(1952) is much better, though. But this one does have an original plot and a good cast, although Gloria Grahame was much better in "In A Lonely Place." It also has one of the most spectacular endings of any movie I have ever seen. It is very innovative in style and editing, and it goes to show you the effectiveness that was possible with traditional film making techniques. Of course, as a modern movie director I can appreciate the novelty of the ending, but my real comparisons are to the computer-generated graphics featured in modern films. There is nothing even close for nearly a decade until "Corrina, Corrina." So I suppose I am merely diverting myself.Anyway, years later "Death of a Neighbor" still has an interesting style and keeps your interest as Dr. Kubik(Neil Hamilton) solves a murder case. Dr. Kubik was formerly a scientist, but his wife's death drove him over the brink. It is all judgement day to Kubik, but he eventually becomes a Detective and solves he greatest case running up against an abusive and murderous Colonel (Wallace Ford) and Martin Sheen's psychotic nephew, using science and logic as his weapons to solve this murder. There is also a businessman (John Banner) who commits murder to disinherit his
. When he sees how well a trip with the boys can potentially go, being an overly critical man, he pushes himself to do the best job he can. As the scoutmaster, he had very little control over the boys and was forced to watch them grow... as a brother would. But his billy club became his trusty sceptre, walking his boys through the great outdoors, and in the end, he becomes probable the best scoutmaster in the history of scouting.This was outstanding. The characters were each like pincushions under a barrage of bullets, and many of them are the same in each other. They all have problems, they all have dislikes, especially that of Robert Jordan, each event in their lives made them what they are and how they are. The only distinction I found that anyone had was each one reacted to a situation in a slightly different way. The dialogue was brilliant and moved the story along. It actually struck me as being oh so real, especially the times in the '20s when Robert Jordan would take the troop tramping or fishing and they were out of touch with civilization by a day at least. There were a few choice words that would puzzle any boy scout, some of the things done to the major character in this book were just awful. I really became attached to all the young actors in this drama, almost more so than
a modern show in terms of lighting, choreography and the unified movement. Seagull, White Morning, Still and Dust were all genrally excellent, except Seagull in my opinion which didn't get the things that the audiecne probably expected, outside of my expectations. I generally feedback to people that, your experience is generally the performance you expected. Some of the people in the audience probably expected something a little bit more out there, because the show conjuers, in a news report as pretty experimental, and people were acctually expecting that. I think that next time I'll watch it, I'll probably con you and expect nothing. But I think that the biggest issue was simply the storytelling. My points were brief, fiction as a theme was not the point of cutting, where as a veiwer you're used to focusing on point and the universals of narrative. But that was my perspective, and I enjoyed the performance. I thought it was pretty cool. The acting was fantastic, but the time being on stage was too long, just happened on the thoughts or because they have too large a cast I've seen this show at the national theatre, and it's one of the reasons that they have to cut it. I think one of the key issues in relation to the acting in this show was that the performers were applaudable, but one of the
this movie on the right foot. On to the politicians... certainly a subject worthy of examination in the arts. But I found the "art house" parts and the "political" parts mixed, and in my humble opinion, not very artfully mixed. Two different stories with a scant few common characters did not work for this making-of-"The Candidate" viewer. One was left feeling that there was neither a good story by itself, nor a good story when mixed together. Having said that, I enjoyed the work of the fine cast, and I am sure in close view just enough touches of the dual stories to keep one interested. The bottom line: worth watching, but not as good as the TV mini-series on Kennedy's run for office a few years ago, and not as good as I was expecting because of the different aspects of politics and the arts that this movie might highlight. Well back from 5 stars, but far from a 2-star effort. Okay cinq, but... A film by a younger director/writer who had to stretch to write both sides of this story would certainly have shown significantly better results, I think! In retrospect, I would rather learn more about the producer and the riders titles people and perhaps a better story carrier.

Rhames though. I saw some promise in the film but decided it was pointless at the end and not as clever as I thought. Some things, like how Reese & Bluv's friendship started was a little interesting but things like this and the lack of connection to the characters lead to me being bored through the majority of the film. Predictable, no funny jokes that make you laugh out loud, not amazing but not horrible either. Obviously better than most Hollywood films though. 5/10 Great graphics, nice costumes, make-up, visual effects, action, & entertaining. They dont all fit work and together though. Not overly offensive. N-trop character. Didnt appear to affect the outcome. I do think it's too violent though. The soundtrack is not too catchy and its sequel is better. 5 out of 10. But in their defence they probably didn't give this film that much budget and one of the writers has admitted they got less money than than the first film. Need more from the latter sequelspective writers. Some are a good team. 10/10 Overall. See From. Ice. Sinett's drawn on The Case? @Gina Smith.

don't PAY for it. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It was directed by Virgil Films, and has some classic classical music thrown in...for unfortunately no reason. The plot line, if there even is one, consists of a brief drug deal heard about in the beginning, a van ride to "a beach with white unavailable girls" (Real Line!) with six douche bags. These beach characters are all from different places and have different lifestyles. (Just like the real-life beach people, the ones that actually stay at the beach). We also get to know the B-plots, which isn't a plot. We have Bevo and buddy who accidentally bought drugs from a homeless guy, a dogfighting business (great minds think alike...they had copied "Best of the Best! Land of Honor" a little too much) and random spouses that ride around in vans in 2007, and pickup up 13-year-olds. Totally not menacing. I never expected to see the same hand bringing me a porno dvd on my 13th birthday. But, they aren't even pornographers...They make documentaries. Smart. The film, however wasn't smart, as the images were timed to the music with non-sequitur cues. There

teasers of it on the leading networks and cords, you would think that it was going to be a romantic comedy. Instead, it was an action drama with romance involved. After all, there was a beautiful and talented actress Grace Park as the lead of the show. While, she was not hired to be a just a pretty face as she would have no lines to speak. However, she did have a good relationship with all the behind the scenes people since she could speak Korean and the commotion of this show caused Sky Castle to go on a hiatus for a while as Sky Castle started in the same plot as Key West. But, soon, as soon as the drama matured the whole plot will transform into a raw raw action drama. Gary looks all desperate on the show while Dae Gee are annoyed returning older actors are still considered attractive. Eun-hae lives in Key West the same way he lived since England. Park Su-jeong is alive and repaying her aunt by running a talent agency and is a powerful woman behind the scenes. Her agency includes Rihwa, who loves Super junior. Sang-hyun comes to Key West to enroll at the gabaton school and Lee Seo-Won or I don't know what to call him in the drama stops him in his track and introduces him to a bunch of strangers.

us get together and critique a different film...most of which are not good. Really bad comedies (e.g., Bewitched, Horndog, etc.), really bad horror films (Pumpkinhead, etc.), really bad science fiction (Deep Rising, etc.), etc., etc. So I get into the habit of watching just about anything that is second billed at a theater, or on cable tv for that matter. Often during the summer I watch a lot of bad movies given that I am awake late at night to run The Insomniac. At any rate, I probably watch more movies than any other person you know. But because I love movies, I am still extremely hard to please. I know bad movies should be fun, and they usually are for the most part. However it's not that fun when a film is a sloppy horrid mess. There are some enjoyable mindless monster films...check out The Worst Case Scenario, Frankenfish and Troll 2 for my top rankings of good bad movies. They still have a plot, characters, and meet horrible logic and conditioning at their emotional laughter inducing points of their screenplays. But a movie that is a sloppy mess...that ain't good, ya'll. Having said that, Six String Samurai, despite the title, is simply a decent movie

of Airplane. (Oh, wait, Chris Rock did that...). Once again, the structure is lacking (the bag at the airport has a larger part that deals with the black character entering the airport with him and his wife, who are then separated, etc.  But then we're left with very weak storylines/multiples plots/characters who are one dimensionals) so don't expect to laugh much after the first, oh let's say 4 jokes. It is rare that I go to a movie and ask myself what I did for my money...this is no exception. If you miss this movie, you'll miss something. Put it another way, you won't learn anything you didn't know about bad movies. The character who suffers the most in a bad movie is, of course, the comedy director. Look, you go to see The Rutles and you just accept it will be terrible, or even in Vera Drake you anticipate a fully commercialized irony. But you go to see a movie with Whitford and you expect SOMETHING. Well, nothing works in the script, and the large cast of actors all are left merely mugging it in exaggerated manner. I
of that era, but with a focus on fallen heroes, not anti-war. I believe the movie should be required viewing for all school children since we need to remind future generations of the great cost our nation and children paid in order to end Nazi and Imperial Japan tyranny with unconditional surrender. IMHO, this will distinguish the movie from other WWII films that have flooded the market in recent years like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Letters From Iwo Jima". We did lose our sons and daughters; they didn't die as victims because America didn't try hard enough. In fact it pushed our war-weary nation, a democracy, to try and end the war because of the terrible suffering felt amongst the population. However, the war was won, and rightly so. We would have become Nazi colonies if the war hadn't been won. The war resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 million people, of which America lost 1/3 of a million of her sons & daughters. German casualties were about 9.5 million and Japanese were 5 million. It is bad enough that we have to send young men and women into combat today, many times without adequate equipment and supplies, and for short engagements. WWII actually justified an unconditional surrender. Now, those thugs and dictators using the ruse of

its source material. It ripped off ideas from the book but really that doesn't matter as that wasn't needed for this film...because: it's more stupid than the book. Although the book is about a dangerous virus, Congo was all about creatures, adventure and a mysterious location. All of that got thrown out of the window for a story that doesn't elaborate or explain itself. The plot works on paper but in practice it's an irresponsible cluster. It's impossible to follow, confusing and the constant usage of random cuts in between boring filler shots is annoying to watch. It's hard enough to have so much going on at once -and it was around two stories from the book and the film doesn't use either one to its fullest- but Congo still expected viewers to keep their attention while cutting back and forth between a bunch of things. The human characters are the biggest offenders here. All three of them worked out! It feels out of place here because noone takes it serious. They're there for comic relief because the film tries to do jokes too hard. Many of these gags do work. It's hard to identify what because it's so repetitive and it happens often. An example: Congo; the plantation boy catching animals with his butt...yeah it's a pretty funny idea to mess around with but the film
to a girl named Kate who is desperately looking for a guy to sleep with her so she can get an ultrasound. They both agree to share a bed that night and a relationship ensues. When Lisa returns to San Diego, she realizes that she's pregnant with Kate's baby, and she makes’s the tough decision to raise the child on her own. Lisa, who has no prior experience in child-rearing, has a lot to learn and she encounters some hi-jinks along the way. Kate blasts out of Lisa's life, but she always wanted to be at peace with having had sex, and she does ok. The story ends in the present - we learn that Kate is pregnant with Lisa's child. Kate has her boyfriend's name on her uterus, which may not be the best way to identify the father of the baby. Kate wants to raise the son, but is doubtful about his ever getting to know his biological mother. Throughout the story, we follow the three characters (Mica, Lisa and Kate), we chart their progress, and see how hard it is for them to accept their responsibilities. There aren't many surprises or obvious plot twists, which is mostly like watching a biographical documentary of how three different people handle parenthood. Isn't that interesting???

up in interesting ways, as in the episode here, and any residual mystery or suspense was avoided. Early on it was figured out that the girl embezzled from her dentist. Effectively, what happened was identical to the murder of Gene Deerfield in Part 10. Lauren went through a lot of trouble to fake his death, but when Dave wrecked her plans, it was too late. He was an old-school psycho who was known to do things that were not quite legal. In short, the way she played with him was a product of the curiosity to see how far she could go. He knew he had been played after he took her to the abandoned house and they were reunited. The way he tried to negotiate a peaceful end was a tremendous change from the beginning, where he set the fire to get in touch with Quinn. Keeping the burn scar (a false connection) linked him to the case. His confession was immediate, but his hesitation in confessing to her was in response to knowing she was working with Quinn. One of the aspects I appreciated about this was that Dave really loved Lauren and put her way ahead of his misdeeds. He had the opportunity to return to a life where he could do as he liked, but he looked to the end of what he had planned for them. The change when he disagreed with Lauren about looking for
Friday, for example.. I laughed so hard.  I like all the movies with <SPOILER ALERT</SPOILER ALERT><IMAGE: 8660:logo:red overlay</IMAGE: 8660:logo:red overlay> in stand-up comic roles. This movie is a good example of his best screen work. The movie was probably done on a pretty tight budget [$50 mil back then is nothing today] it helps that the filmmakers had all of Denin's standup routines in front of them. I think this film would have been a great vehicle for Denin if he had sunk his teeth into a more substantial role. It's a good set up for a road trip comedy. If you were going to make a movie like this, I think you would have to be smart and avoid all the obvious pitfalls. Bill MAcay..such a bald headed buffoon.

But when Sharpe steps out for a moment, a misty-looking figure wanders into the cell and he starts listing all the prisoners who will be brought there once it gets going again. And when Sharpe goes out to trash the place for the night, he finds a very angry Conan O’Brien standing there waiting to change his cell number – 666, of course.

dissappointment there was no dodging car chases in this movie either. The only vigilante action takes place at the end of the movie, meaning the mane plot of the movie was pointless. This movie show real violence. I can understand that many people might not like that, but as a by the books revenge story, this movie was done right. If you liked this movie you might just like Kill Bill or the Japanese Deathnote series. Side-note: this movie is available on Netflix. So go ahead and watch it ;) P.S: I gave it a 7 because the story was done right :). Just the acting and pacing were awful but who cares, they're not supposed to be stars. They're supposed to act. Plus,-the film makers and fellow actors and actresses pulled through on the budget and film shoot. So kudos to them. This movie got is A rated budget in my book. They tried hard. Far from perfect. Far from great but worth the admission price The haters of this movie just don't know what to do with this movie because 1 the rape scene in the beginning and 2 the bible quotes in the movie. On top of that, can we point out that Jesus had some God complex? Hitting lots of people in the face with a lot of Gospel references in 1 movie. Take that you haters haha

a family vacation video that got edited into a longer, narrated, viral video on YouTube. Going by the name "The Scary Film" on the filmmakers' YouTube page means that they've made a conscious decision to follow in the footsteps of films like "House Of The Devil" and "Shaun Of The Dead" rather than confining themselves to just being My Strange Addiction recreational video with horrible acting and fake screen effects. The horror genre has one more trotted out facet it can try to revitalise - the obscure and amateur original, probably the most common of which is the "family vacation video that has to be watched with headphones on." You can find these poorly made videos all over the Internet, but they all began with home videos of real events, or in this case a film, that was made by filmmakers just like you or me.

I will, however, will make mention of the strengths of an individual whose moral fiber and ethical standards earned him the title of “courageous leader”, whose clarity of thought earned him the sobriquet of “Iron Mike” and whose sense of humor earned him the title “Champ”.

That’s right, all you Paulie phuckers may be spitting nut oil, but Ludwig (“Lewie”) Coleman, though he is only 19 (is he even 19 yet?), sees right to what you are doing, and he wrote a spectacular tautological trendily-titled article in his weekly column called “Paulie is a douche bag, not a real champ!” Waaahahahahaha!

We were at the very front of the stalls and I could see light shining through the computer generated runway that was meant to be under North Korean Reggie’s feet in Cairo. The scene stealer for me was Gamora (Zoe Saldana) because she was the only person with half a personality in it. After getting over the disappointment of Marvel wasting one of the greatest comic book lead characters in history I started thinking about the potential genre. The film’s budget was the largest for a non-21st century action film. It made over a billion dollars. I’d even say the suits got value for their money. So sure the film wasn’t what was needed for 2014 but there was potential beneath it begging to be unleashed. I’ve heard time and again how there should be a female centric superhero team film, Tom Hollands co-wrote a high school Avengers influenced concept with Nicole Perlman. They struggled to get it made and finally made in 2016. They got actress Felicity Jones to play the lead. Lyndsey Wegner had finished her film Sound in The inbox of fanboy George Clooney. Marvel got in touch with her. Three months later, in Nicole, a well placed kiss and the contract was signed. From there
-feeling road movie. After his New York sojourn and his London jackpot, he goes to Cairo. The film is mostly about good people enjoying alive life, not about cops-robbers the way Batman or Scarface or Reservoir Dogs are. Sensuality, love, music, dancing, and votes are the warm stuff we need to survive in a world where the New York times leads every morning des lyres of death, and the half factual articles cement it. Morocco and Cairo, stars of Sahara, that's the breeding ground of the immigrants. The people of Cairo talk gravely of mess in the belly of the Camel and the dogs which guard humanity from god's anger. Which is the right perspective in a life where you shit with the street drains. The music: brilliantly illustrative of Mediterranean spirit. The series tells the tale of the overcoming of passions, not their proliferation, and doesn't insist on drug selling or stealing.
