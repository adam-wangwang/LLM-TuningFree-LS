. Joe ( Viggo Mortensen) and Annika (Claire Danes) are the adult children of Glen (Omega's Strangelove's Peter MacNicol) and his wife (Vanessa Redgrave). Joe and Annika are estranged, thanks to the reluctance of Glen to come out of the closet. Joe coaches track and Annika is sickly; her specialty is more on the philosophical with dressing down people's nascent emotional sensibilities a la Miranda from Sex and the City (her and Burger's Samantha Seaborn from The West Wing share dialogue that involves fashion critique turned therapy). Joe does not have the emotional intelligence to connect with Annika. As a deliberate risk that pays off, Annika succumbs to her fatal illness after sleeping with Joe. Joe is not qualified to be her sole caretaker. He does, however, succeed bringing the estranged family together in Glen's time of need. While not of stamina of a full-length film, Evening is competently made; Jeffery Hatcher's script, in which the story takes place, is cinemagical enough. I don't know if people outside the gay community will be able to stomach this film though, especially people 12 and under. It comes in a time where the eleph

isn't nearly as fun as the previous ones, with Bill unable to attend for one reason or another. The plot is needlessly convoluted for a series about Bill and his brothers, but the dialogue will be enough for fans of the show. The real joy is in the extended musical performances, offering songs we've never heard before. However, those have been noted elsewhere, so enter at your own risk if you consider Bill's story line spoilers. Overall, not up to the previous three episodes, but a step above the horrible TV series. Can't wait to start binge watching the 1-7 on Netflix again. Well made. I enjoy watching any Bill Murrary movie! Lots of new and classic performances. Just wish they would make the first 4 or 5 seasons into a Netflix series. Worth seeing! I remember watching the original on TV when it came out, so the longer gaps between the movies never bothers me. If you're watching the other movies, it's more than worth waiting for this one. Not crazy about this one as much as the previous three Cracker films, though I still really enjoyed watching it! Lately, I don't have the patience to watch seasons of TV shows, but I love these 90 minute movies! Jeff Bridges appears to be "just Jeff", but the film also stars Nicolas C
Italy, The House on The Edge of The Park is a simple story of two thuggish rednecks, Fred Newland (David Hess) and Ricky (Giovanni Lombardo Radice), who are looking to blow off some steam by inviting an unsuspecting girl, Lorraine (Caterina Boratto) and some random guy, Carlo (Paolo Malco) over to party at an old farmhouse located on the edge of a park. But what Fred and Ricky have in mind isn’t a fair exchange of affection. They want to torture and kill the two for sport. Along with the thugs comes a group of militants, for what is otherwise a simple tale becomes a critique of the hippie generation. Who represents the 1960s represent, and could something positive come out of this new era, are the questions on display here. But first and foremost, there’s voodoo and cuckoo. Troubled by youths who refuse to follow the rules, one might feel it’s an affront against civilization. It’s enough to make a grown man sang fans foo! Fortimus tansit. Translation: I can but stand and wait. Fulci was known for some very prominent scenes of extreme violence, which are what make his later films noteworthy, so don’t expect anything too blasphemous here
this blog for years – I must confess I am new. I also wonder if the the topics and the manner of the business can be interpreted by the comments – with a couple of exceptions of course. For years I have encouraged women to “get off the bench and play” but after reading the comments I am quite sure the conversation here is rather discomforting to those who are trying something new – or – if they don’t normally talk so loudly it is often intimidating. Now we can bring up something new in meetings or groups like “the conversation must be removed from here immediately and into private by Friday afternoon”. What business are we in again? I’m concerned the environment may prevent an employee from generating new S&S business. With some of the arrogance dispensed even to things without argument I wonder if some think the business is simple and laughable. Other comments remind me of a retired player I interviewed about one of my books (?) saying his Dad “hit a bucket of balls a day when he retired and no one could believe how good he was so he didn’t tell his score”. Sorry – can’t paraphrase this well as it doesn’t make too much sense – but – it really didn’t matter HOW GOOD someone was if they were retired. But one thing both “boys” seem to agree on – “newbies suck and old road dogs
shows, be they excellent or awful, do their darndest to convince the audience that this is serious programming, I feel that "Bionic Showdown" wanted to be something else - a trashy but really entertaining screen grapplefest (think "Rocky III" and "The Last Dragon"), taking itself as little as possible seriously. I mean, if you can deliver a line like "Those cyborg ruffians are out there makin' my flesh crawl." how can you expect anything else? The script is cringeworthy and the acting stiff as a board, but if I wanted smart, I'd go to the library instead of watching a TV movie from the 80's. To a good degree, the results are entertaining due to heart and a decent amount directorial competence, which are, in reality, more than common two other inferior films could tell. You may forget about this film, unless you're an '80's fan, but "Bionic Showdown" stands as an entertaining viewing, almost by itself. But don't let me ruin it for you, find out for yourself. 5.5 out of 10 if you ask me.+ info on IMDB+ purchase on Amazon.com+ comment on Amazon.com+ comment on IMDB edited by soopiee[]CodeReplacement:ied please![oMB

best, while the later ones get watered down, lose the magic, appear more phoned in, whatever. In the Blair Witch Project, though, after the first flowers of the franchise ("who didn't love 'em") were plucked, the director relied even less on characterization, a coherent story, believable acting or anything else that's "overhead" in storytelling. Now it's more a formula, a simple structure to follow, where satisfying the audience is the bottom line. The whole thing is more clinical and cynical and towards this...lessening of the original idea and decreasing desire to maintain the qualities of the original success that made it a success in the first place. As I'm writing this, to be honest, I'm starting to wonder why I, who views these things in general as "one step away from stupid" should even bother to write. My wife noted yesterday that MR16 already earns a very high living, even in this economy. So there's nothing to convince me that's it a good idea to saddle her with a beached whale of always increasing monetary liabilities.

waited patiently for the release of The Cocoanuts (1929) on DVD. Put together a fabulously funny movie with an involving computer game and you will have a very happy old codger indeed. The parcheesi, er, I mean textmining, candy is the addition of line drawings of the characters, many from actual Paramount Studio cartoons, sprinkled throughout the film. The complete film experience, thanks to the folks over at The Internet Archive and in particular the mastermind of the whole kickoff revival, James Smith, can now be appreciated in a new and gorgeous way. The top image in this blog is an ellaboration on an image seen in the Casino scene in The Cocoanuts. Hopefully the rest of Groucho's timeless classics will be made available before next millenium.

who will rule the province of Shanghai. The de facto ruler of the province, Whiskey Wu (Wai-Man Lam), is allowing one of his underlings, Jung Restaurant (Dick Wei), to take the election prize. What the province needs is just a front because the major operation is pulling money out of the province and shipping it overseas. For such an operation to succeed, they need, at the very least, the silent approval of Wu. Wu protects the shipments and intimidates the competition. There are, of course, those who don’t like the way Wu runs things. On one side, the provincial police led by Commander Wen Yeung (Warren Fung). Many of the cops are criminals themselves who want in on the deal. From the other side, the Triad leader, No Gnamm Jimmy (Yuen-Man Cheung) and his two thugs (Francis Ng and Gino Mak). Wu has also been amassing an army of gangsters led by Bosco (Question Mark) and his henchmen. Surprisingly, though, the party the cops don’t want involved is the police. They have their own agenda, which is to eventually. Election gives Woo the opportunity to cast all of the actors from his two major movies at the time: The Killer and Hard Boiled into one big
but we've also sat through a lot of one-joke comedies and pretentious essays on the meaning of life or that whole supernatural crap. Even unlikeABLE, from late last year, had a lot of laughs and also a lot more insight into human interaction and the meaning of friendship. Such a movie struts through the reasonably well-worn ground of what Christian barlow might call the "Collegiate Equality Equal Op Equal Opportunity Film". Think Sing, for lack of a better example. Brown of Harvard, on the other hand, pretends to rise above all of that crap. And then there's nothing of consequence to be seen. It's a shallow film centered around a love triangle that shouldn't be called one, but is just monologued constantly by Brown, a train-wreck, hyper-analytical sociology student. In training? Har. Sociology student. In Harvard. Sophomoric '60s rich spoiled kid humor. Get it? This humble film breaks my poor illiterate little heart. If you're going to stand for something, don't shoot low. And if you feel compelled to spread some moral lessons, at least say something meaningful. This isn't edgy. And it's not clever. Find some other way to hide shallow nuttiness under a veneer of
Year’s Eve films of the era. I’d also refer to it as the modern equivalent of Planes and Trains and Automobiles. It’s a checklist movie about a fun combination of species but always ends up hitting the same note. Most dating films did. At least this one scores decent characters and an even broader range of influences. It especially slides from 30’s screwball comedy and the slapstick First National comedy teams to straight drama. It also declares that even children and associates can be coarse or creepy. However the plot still suffers from the reality that a film this early on needs a catharsis that several stories simply can’t provide. Right from the start I had the feeling that it would need a plot akin to The Gold Rush. There is a tight aspect to both pictures that should have come into focus quickly but with enough leeway for growth. For some reason the first half of this film still feels cramped. Where Chaplin succeeds in his climactic resort to nonsense Patterson seems trapped. This would become a major problem during this arc in film comedy. Everything becomes too lite by the start of the 40’s. Now this picture has likeable talent that one can come to recognize and even feel for. It is part of the brand associated with the Monogram team and the studio at large
thought the movie was gonna focus on their lives and how they become finalists. It turns out it was more of a semi-movie. It's the lead actors' debut motion picture, not the reality show winners. Overall the film was enjoyable. I love it when movies redefine things such as relationships. If you are in a relationship, you know what I'm talking about. Most of the characters were so interesting as they were all complicated and gritty. The lead actress was more than just a woman on the screen. She brought a lot to the film, as her character, in my opinion, had the most development, despite beginning as a man-eater. I love her transformation throughout the movie. I also enjoyed seeing the dark gritty version of GA special agent Burell. he never backed down, which made up for the FBI fumbling more than once in the film. I also liked the tie-in between Missi and her father, it was cute. You can definitely see star potential here. They have good characters they can work with and expand on. The action is just right and the actors and actresses in the film have done great. The down points for me were the gaps in logic. I know it's a movie, but you have no explanation for her skills, other than she was once a weapon (another lame attempt to make a sequel reference). It
made. My ratings are based off of the uncut "complete" episodes, which for me, is more entertaining than just a weekly episode. Perhaps if I had not rewatched it, I may have changed some stars down. This season is, just like Season 10, the least "oh my god" funny season of the show. But there's still a lot of good stuff I believe in this. Dave Chapelle is welcomed back, this was his last appearances for a while, and the best gags in the season come from him. For me, Dave is 1,000 times funnier than the other dude (I've heard his name and don't give a strawberry dick). I guess, the previous season, they did a lot of parodies of crappy "reality" television, the show did not have a grip on things non-reality tv shows had poked fun at so the gags were horrible and childish. This season, it seems they seem to keep closer to the "Reality" stuff, however when they go into Dwayne Johnson ("The Rock" guy) being in a wrestling match and stealing back the town of Austin, after Robert Deniro and the gang steal it, the gags turn silly. The feature the prank phone calls which are funny, but after years of waiting and being disappointed
how terrible everyone is. There are no British films like Lethal Weapon or Daybreakers or The Avengers or Iron Man 2. There are no films about Newcastle being attacked by an x-rated parrot pimp from Virginia and fighting him off with a wrecking ball. If you want inaccurate representations of British culture, ignore films and just look at TV. There children are always happy and scotched eggs are probably considered vegetables. And I can't walk down the street without bumping into a young lad telling a carload of friends about how he has been knocked over in front of an old building for the fourth time that day. For the Organising Committee it is unsurprising that the definition of cultural poverty is deliberately a dirty bucket of gravel. The point is, that the main reason why the film sector may also overindex on unemployment is because, even within the creative industries, the communications and screen industries are at the bottom of the scrap heap. The other vital point here is that this is an English definition. Even within the small pool of screen works that do depict Northern Ireland, they primarily occupy more a retired terrorist-led gang than a bunch of skateboards waving about folk art. Furthermore, much of Iraq appears to be a ruined version of He-Man's kingdom of Eternia, with the odd
movie. Actually, it was an insult to the very intelligence of the writer Joseph Losey. German made film; based upon the well-known book WIE EINE MULIE (The Wayward Widow) by Joseph Losey. It always amazes me, the quantity of good to great books that time and again are rendered into movies and without fail, totally transformed into something BESIDES a good piece of entertainment. This time the movie was raw, vulgar, filled with coarse language, misdirected paying more attention to the TECHNICAL aspects of filmmaking than to the story it meant to tell, a slug with reprisal scenes of coarse, vulgar, coitus and brilliant cases of verbal abuse. It was, in conclusion, a pathetic display of bad taste and careless, sloppy measures for converting a book to the screen. Pity there are no measurements between a GOOD BOOK and a GOOD MOVIE. We would then have been spared this outrage to an otherwise superb ROMANCE. I wanted to cry when the ridiculous train robbery scene was shown. My husband cares nothing for books and even he suggests I stick to reading because movies, well, often lack the magical verve of books. He feels this was a horrible movie and he was resigned to leave our DVD's of
to tears, the first movie that made me hold my breath during a tense scene, and that's just two things, there were many others. This is, in my opinion one of the top ten movies of all time. It's deep and heart wrenching. It grabs you and compels you to live each moment of the movie with the characters. I actually believed that I too was a part of the movie. There is really nothing to say about this wonderful flick, except that it is definitely not to be missed under any circumstance. So go bake some Brownies, see the movie, and reserve your sobs for the last 2 minutes. All i can say is, if youve seen this movie, good luck preventing yourself from bursting into tears when you hear Alan arguing with his grandma or David fighting Milo, or whenever you stumble upon one of the other numerous heart-wrenching moments this outstanding movie offers. A masterpiece for sure. … written by daniel on March 6, 2008 IMDb By 5.0/5 Free Shipping Directed by: Seth Gordon Starring: Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott, Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, Eddie Kaye Thomas Genres: Comedy MPAA Rating: R For Strong Crude And Sexual Content, Pervasive Language and
are clearly recognizable, particularly the popping Kurtz. Where this film excels are in the random synergic collisions of various great past film characters, such as a cinematically and emotionally captivating appearance of a young man played by Rod Taylor; notable encapsulation of submarine action combat and great wartime enemy camp sets; spectacularly abortive rocket arming sequence; and clever seamless ending which wipes the slate clean and sees the cast start life over again. As is often the case in period pieces, the 19th century dancing and demonstrating is slavishly rendered and takes away from the film segment, such as the Way To Mandalay in which Terry-Thomas as the Prince appears as a caricature of Bruce Cabot in the classic Mutiny on the Bounty. The title term City of Lost Children is heard, but not applied to an identified locale or foreign objective beyond the final incarnations in the weird and disturbing dreams of Martin Stewarts's Clayboy and the crime queen. A moment that any filmgoer will never forget is Terry-Thomas's theatrical gesture to be revealed in the pinched vertical Smellovision window of any town cinema, but this many editions of television or DVD since, is beyond reason to bridge to a virtualagency.com overview - best accessed directly here - .

contrast, the 2006 live-action version is a confused, contrived jumble, reaching for some mysterious and arcane lessons, uncomfortably aimed at teenage and adult meanderers. Because the 2006 version has no clear and solid change to the plot, cutesy and charming are replaced with confusing and tedious. Because the 2006 version has no clear protagonist or conflict (two major keys to creating a great fictional story), the protagonist becomes man's lust and anger and the conflict becomes an exercise in exploring the meaning of unrequited love between toy cars. The plot is also muddled with repeated flashbacks with two different sets of characters, causing the viewer to wonder what is happening, what was happening, and why is it happening? The CGI effects are pretty good. And the theme song, as played by Plain White Ts, is sort of catchy. All in all, the movie is pleasingly devoid of the unnecessary moments of vulgarity and glamour found in many movies of this era. This movie is adequate or excusable but not great. Film snobs may enjoy the educational element but pop culture lovers may grieve over the painful waste of their time and money. Sadly, this film represents the canvas of a world famous artist but the palette and brush of
this movie. The actors are not up to par with others Imelda was shallow in role like I am not a legend in Mays concert at the Kennedy Center. She KNOWS damn well of her talent. She lost out from the incomparable Lea Salonga do you still need to compete with her What you did w/ Al Pacino was on the right track. plus she shows alot in her personality on this performance with Marie Antoinette The movie even lacks the songs, and I listened to the songs over and over on my iPod. Even lately from our national Alimango Dance and treasure o' the East (T.O.T.E) went to more international and national trivia contest than their GK. If they really did not choose this as their project. It's okay... One man's garbage is another man's treasure or so I THINK THEY ARE SO BORING. SHAME ON THEM. SHAME ON THEM. SHAME ON THEM. SHAME ON THEM SHAME ON THEM. SHame on them... I am really disappointed. One comment is slapping Imelda is the most paid political dynasty in america. Frankly speaking, I prefer ANGELA LANSBURY as Madame DeThorceau. Because of your movie I felt like singing

is trying to fix his kitchen sink. With the help of a friend, Joe studies the operation manual and tries to do the plumber thing. Ian, the friend, only recently became employed and he's apparently a quick learner. Unfortunately for them, crazy Uncle Henry is guest government inspector. What should have been a routine repair turns out to be a scene of hilarious comedy. This is a great short. If you've never seen a McDoakes short before, try this one out. The texture of things has several colored mattes and some nice design joined by some bright colors as well as other set design that looks very attractive. This short begins with a loud pop and an extremely attractive design. One purpose of the yellow mattes in the short that was to almost put us into a slightly yellow tinted world of absurdity. I like the design work done with this one. There are several different shorts on this same disc; but this one is the comedic one, so mixed together on a normal disc, would not be a very pleasant stream of events. This one has backgrounds, and design that really were not a part of the construction scene. But yeah, the kitchen scene that follows is extremely well done. The artwork that was used for Joe's kitchen also was quite good. Finally, there were slight alterations made in the final scene by splitting the frame in order to make the characters appear
actors because they knew what they were leaping into. I loved the original film which I watched on the big screen. As with films based on books, this one in no way reflected the book. So disappointing! A complete waste of money and time. If you cannot think of anything better to watch, do spot the silky dresses and hats! If you have to watch this film, I suggest you watch it last. If you see it first, you will lose all hope as the rest of the films on the DVD may be the Goodies! Channel 5 don't spoil us anymore, please? I await the next low budget disaster film! Crummy! Roman Holiday, the book, is so much better than this! No wonder the actor decided to turn down the offer to Hollywood! I cannot understand why the author was here in the audience. I thought she died many years ago. Do not waste your time with this film. With regret, I must give this 1 star. Pip pip! Movie Overload! 50 Shades of Crimson! Bad, bad, urgh! Save your cash! Please! This is laughingly bad. It would be quicker for me to start listing the positives mmmm (thinking)! Oh yes, Pip pip! Oops! Nope. Sorry, film. Urghhh! No 1 star! Not a 1, not a
say it's anything else. Hmm. Hard. Stylistically it's below Waterworld's (it looks like a cheap TV production, as if with the SFX and ATMOS it got a retouch and some may even think they look all right, but they don't.) But there are some good guys in it and some good moments, but also some overused and I fear predictable plot points. There. Good enough. Hell, almost everybody says Sucker Punch is a great movie and I'm quite befuddled... as it is with Transformers. Let's watch, let's chill, let's drink nothing to loud and then be fulfilled. Now, this one has like totally - excellent jazz... and "yes, we can", please! We all can, right!

film. giroux gives us her protagonists as they are-flawed, teenagers figuring out the world with mixed sets of directions. i love that neither amy or rod withholding giving their entirety to the other (the latter allows the former to stop taking care of her father, the former grants the latter the opportunity to practice sciences with her passion). i love that they disagree with one another, i love that it takes so much time for them to realize that they truly feel for one another. they don't draw the "let's never let space come between us" or "we're doomed to be apart" conclusion some literary romances allude to and/or harp on. amy and rod haven't even sorted the time they do end up spending apart due to institutionalized care and alienation (among many other cruel things). what giroux has done is so important for those still coming to terms with our differences, of allowing choice to step in between reason and recipe. giroux risks and personally, i think she doesn't just absolutely nail a feeling or a truth about teenagers and adults i've found in a lot of contemporary fiction, but that the recipe in question isn't about genetic deformities or understood gifts...but a refund, a return to those we love lost. that it isn't about shaking your
horrible and everytime i saw then i thought : "They surely won't guy any chance on better actingjobs after this fail". I fucking hate it.. I gave it 1/5 because i was forced to rate something. Trust me, there is not a single positive thing on this movie. I don't think i will watch it till the end, after that i am just sure i wanna gouge out my eyes with hot needles. Stop watching shit. I did. I honestly never wanna see this crap again. If you don' Ukrainian! Few times i was shocked like "They made a tv show about me right now?" and after some minutes i realized it was just happening around those guys. I can't remember faces features, but there is some guy who slaps a new-born babe and for some reason i was rooting for him later on in the movie. Remember this words: "Don'take tape, it's cursed". Thank you, and i never again gonna see this again. You can trust me. If you wanna watch some good stuff, i suggest you to not watch this crap.. There are many great movies out there, get movies like "The machinist", "Insomnia", "Angel Heart" and even "Saving Private Ryan" and so one. Get good stuff. This isn'

sense of time couldn't be closer to absolute zero. The fact that this single father must resort to the monstrous evil of reading the physical newspaper to find the data on a person's day gives you an idea of how archaic this action thriller is. As you'd expect from a '90s film, the "cool" women here have cable connections, tubs of shampoo, and husbands who sell cocaine. Characters blaze past the camera while skateboarding and listening to Public Enemy. At one point, Jay is given a Walkman with a CD-R disk that recurs as a plot device later on. Ridiculous bon mots like "government hacker," "Earth Year 2012," and "zero police prior exposure" are predicted as if to make the proceedings even wackier than they already are.

film, the post that I refer to is here, and is followed by amusing responses from the contentious reviewer, the kind of person we writers get to come face to face with in the cruel real word of comments threads. But anyway back to the actual review. In case you cant read it, let me summarise, it consists of 1 sentence of the most superanovious ‘absolutely fucking bloody awful.’ This review will be shorter than that review. The reviewer did make some good points, and in it’s defense I have read positive reviews, the Financial Times ‘young adults will find it powerfully, tenderly touching’ and World Socialist etc. But unfortunately I defer to movies that are less depressing in their portrayal of Venice. For what it is worth I would recommend the Venetian Adventure by Tom Williams. Its far better read of independent Venice. Ok, not contemporary Venice, but if you are going to have Book of Leon Crimson, Venice and gambling, imagine it 17th century, and there you have it. Small, independent, beautiful, proud, and heroic. So please save yourself the 90 minutes, you are probably better off another edition of Batman. Or better still Venice can be experienced actually, just go somewhere else. It is not always a principality of fear. Although It
any sense to us if you you have not seen the original 1902s master piece. It is something you have to watch. For the purists this movie is hard to digest in the beginning but, we find it O.K. for better or worse. It is different from the old one seem fluent action can be found in the computerized work. The movie should not be watch at a theatre (as one reviewer recommended) but, it is a good ?to watch? at home. The industry miles stone given by IMAX. Three cheers for the new guys. Any way our kids enjoyed it (as we did). There are nothing but praises from our children. The art form itself is great to look at. But unfortunately (as far as we understand) 3D imaging done by IMAX was done in Adobe Premier which is another copybiatory technique. Any way we love to see IMAX movies contiue to create more glories as in this case. CoBiatore can resurg sets very good overprice hype for the future. We seems to forget the creative genius of Edison and Tarkovsky and friends (who has made novel concept in his art form). Our best wishes to the makers and to the viewers of this movie. Come on in India let?s open our eyes together. Hey world have the heart to watch this???!?!! You cannot imagine what
an offbeat sci-fi cartoon about bio-engineered animals. It’s ugly, it’s trashy, and it leaves me wanting more! Of course, this is me we’re talking about. Twenty years ago, Ralph Bakshi left us Son of Celluloid. This was intended to be an animated adaptation of Conan the Destroyer, a film so horrid that Bakshi would rather pay off a mafioso than ever finish it. BoomStudios picked it up thirty years later and released it. I didn’t watch the film, but thanks to this book, I at least think I got some of the gist of the movie. My expectations weren’t high, and with very little investment in it, I want more. Littered with sex jokes and cheesecake, it’s not worth whatever insults I pay for it. But occasionally, characters show up who don’t act like boobs. The Tamian (Bambi) and Thull (Jason) are actually fairly well written, and their conversations (censored as they are) are amusing. The plot is somewhat complicated, making it hard to review since I pace around my living quarters while plotting things out. I actually did this a couple of times. I would say that the plot or the characters have depth, but those are probably low bars with
also starts with just a skit where, the viewers are laughing at this other guy. And then, all of a sudden, Uday and Majnu arrive on-screen with their fancy-shmancy song which again is a parody of typical "badmaash" themes. They would whenever their mom said anything have badmaash written all over. Appa from Munna Bhai, Bluff Master, Ramji London Waaley, Dhamaal and many other movies followed. This time, it goes all around the world for them , at least that's what makers think. They go to the IIT entrance examination (What a personal issue that is, with Akki especially. Come on people, he's still young to get into IIT and to know that his characters in most of the movies were from the IIT makes me feel he is the "Old" Sanjay Dutt)  and naturally want to rape those girls, get their very punny, and all, answers and end up choosing the same girls for the movies. The film proceeds where Uday and Majnu claim a film for Majnu (who loves Shiela, I know right), but then they end up doing what every other mainstream Punjab-based movies do - have rich, lavishly decorated-farewells, and un-fill preserverance of
- but I still did not know anything about it. In high school I mentioned all picture processes Ivan. Ivan, you see he was me, I was simply transfering myme anger on my L-plate, my father was Ivan as well and now Ivan has become one my favorite characters in movies. Ivan sound pretty funny in a Czech version (Ivanov), too. He is totally nuts but he kind of set me straight. Thanks, Ivan! Not. Anyway, movies about high school students/college freshmen could be so, so many. Well, this one is not one of the best ever, but it is pretty OK for Mi Smokovic. He plays big fat man Ivan (who took psychology classes at University) sounds much better, but still does not quite come to his previous parts in Mamut or Boys from Bariloche. Ivan Lennon (???) had some pretty average funny scenes and I would take him over Steve Little (keep up with the Macaulay!). Not. Anyway, they are helping Paul Rudd all the way. It was amazing to see him confused... he looks like a good guy and personaly i never expected him to play such a role in this movie... but we have to remember what internet does to our brains!Encarta-like sentences are fun, too, and I see some surfers got some funny funky lines from this movie.

) around her relationship with her husband at the time, a John Waters Cameron protégé that Milburn was looking to replace. I also recall her getting into hot water whilst playing tennis at Althorp and slept with the Prince of Wales at Althorp - Walters and the Dukes of Marlborough's attempts at blackmailing Charles to try to prevent such twitter for media attention. Now I haven't even mentioned her FIVE children. At 66 now, she looks well for her age but maybe it was unfair to make her the front and back cover of the U.K. Daily Star. If she is alright, well then great. For Norman Foster the publication should be retracted first and legal action taken afterwards. It falls short of criminal behaviour, but it is certainly malpractice.

brief for this particular review, and that doesn't change just because I didn't write the story...ha ha. It is definitely not short on details or unique because it's entertaining and goes into good detail (without being too descriptive), especially on the football field. I've never read any of the other NFRA novels, and although this is the ninth one, it works as a standalone. I enjoyed reading this one enough that I may try others. Four stars. I got it free somewhere, and got the second one on sale...and merely a year later, the GoodReads reminder appears that I was supposed to review it already. It's a bit late, but better late than never...better late than never...This time frame is acceptable. They aren't reviewing my book, and if they only look at my reviews after a personal "reminder," it's not time-frame specific. According to a Tweet from one author, his reviews sometimes didn't post right away, so now he waits two days before writing more reviews to see if his posts came through. Not sure anyone actually cares about that kind of stuff...except maybe authors themselves...yet authors should focus on writing. I will finally get to the review: FOOTBALL is NOT for NERDS (NFRA Book 9) by Jennifer Zakroff is the ninth (#9)
...Its one of those movies only I love REALLY truly pound that emotion in my head! when I first got it (think I was 11) I loved the cover and corny dialogue . I rented this one, alone after school in the hot summer sun and I swear..after a few quiet minutes in the LR of my moms house at 11, with no mom in sight...I was scared out of my mind...blood...guts...and stars swimming through the giant blue picket fence? gah... I never got that first image out of my head for weeks and the idea that I lived in a horror/killing world and not my adventure cracking jokes/weeding lad fame world. This I think is truly the most under rated horror film of all time (probably over do/under seen....) & the one many of us have unintentionally hidden/stashed away! "That girl has a blind side you can drive a truck over... Deeeepression, which would explain the designer coffee mug, she's on TUEN'S, and is hell-bent on harvesting my liver." & my favorite quote: "GIVE UP JOHN, HE'S TOO SMARRT!" Givin me chills/laughs to this day!!!!!! Love it
ed at little kids but not everybody will like it. The main target audience seems to be six-year old boys and then maybe girls have to just go along. My own kids watch Huevos de oro sometimes, but they do not really like it all that much. On the other hand, this is an amusing cartoon movie featuring some decent actors...some of them are not exactly very well known in the English-speaking world, like Antonio Banderas and Jim Cummings. Others are known only for dubbing random English-speaking roles. Finally, we have Danny Trejo and Kristen Bell. Not an illustrious line-up to say the least, but one never knows with these things if it works at all. Thankfully, in this particular instance, it does work! Well, kind of. Another good sign is that this movie has to stories by the legendary William Steig. Once again, not a name that is really met much outside the realm of literary critics and academics but he was very prolific and wrote many classics. In fact, I do not know of a single one of his works that did not get a movie or TV adaptation since the 1970s. The title refers to the golden eggs that haul Hansel and Gretel through their adventures. The famous duo steal the eggs and go for a nice walk until they fall into the hands
CGP removed but he had an interrogation in front of the Senate Congressional Committee, who lost their patience with him, and he picks up his family and leaves the country. However, he had a sad accident during the trip and his wife (Kathleen Quinlan) had the formality to sign an impromptu divorce. He then goes to live on a farm somewhere in Wisconsin and stays there to take care of his son Jacob (Mickey Rourke), who is possibly autistic, because he doesn't speak and is frustratingly disobedient. He is left with another son who does not resemble him, comes back occasionally, telling Dutch that he is a psychopath who will later kill many people and screams that a spacecraft will come to take him away. Unfortunately for everyone, it will happen and it will give three days before the explosion of the planet. Dutch must now keep his son away while at the same time making people understand the danger, which they fear, and at the same time the MIB investigation begins to search for this sergeant who has defected.

reasons of certain chapters. In addition to its adaptation flaws, it's a rather basic, slow, dull, and flat film. Analysts are comparing it to Old Testament movies but it pales in comparison. That's the problem. I found myself longing for them at some points. It's a drama film with a story that we've already heard and a flat reenactment that's as black and white as the book's pages. BTW it opens with an unneeded two words, "The Bible". Really? "The Bible" has been around for how many years? Will we now have to add our movie titles with our name too? For example, "ben's Noah" or "garfiel's Noah". Let's keep it simple and write the name of the movie only. It's "Noah", extra words not necessary. Same goes for "Hillary Clinton". She became Hillary the moment she was given the name Hillary. If the name Hillary was that important maybe they should have she should have went with it? Donald who? At the start as God is appearing to Noah and speaking to him the face of Arronofsky (I think?) is thrown on the screen as if he's the voice of God or that somehow he is actually playing God. Maybe he meant that god is a god among the people so it'
hero is Charlie Digger Mellon, placed under 24-hour watch by Homeland Security. Digger has led the most charmed life of anyone since the Declaration of Independence was signed. A Beverly Hills geologist, he snickers at the private sector (because Jobs were for snowflakes) and subsists easily on cash lent him by the owner of the earthquake-powered firm his father founded. The suspicious feds accuse him of plotting to start another American Civil War by merging two opposing political parties, which he’s loyally supported in excellent circumstances over the years to the benefit of richest one percent of the population. Events unravel from here. The government agents recognized Digger was a villain from his perpetual pessimism, even ignoring the Hollywood dreams he displayed when watching a protest march on television. But Digger let his guard down in the strangeness that followed, when economic grievance stopped meaning what it always meant, as when witnessing a home invasion disguised as Quixotic reform, abetted by an HNS character. Set in California à la Ayn Rand, this 1960s treatise on American political corruption failed to thrill much less to keep the pages turning. Digger we forgive; Condon, no way.Flimflam for fortune-favored
LOTR's, but as Legolas never appears on the Silmarillion (I know I'm english-impaired, it souds lie a fish...), I will not tell much about him. (But on the other note, we first met him in the shortstory "The Fall of Gil-Galad" [MAY WE THANK STUART DAVID FREEBORN FOR THAT ONE], where he is described as a tall warrior about 300 years old) Now from that we can guess a few things... First of all, he and his father had been aking as a 'road' for the ruin of beleriand. (Hereafter shortened to Infindel referring to Beleriand's final end and the return to the our Sea, due to this) ...and here I was gonna talk about him. The books may give detail look into his glory and power, but for this competition I'll restrict myself to movie canon. (Or close to movie canton, as I show in the annexes.) DISCLAIMER. This is just an icandory work of fan-GONdryal (my folk really wants that name for any refugee lying far ahead...) and should not be taken as an academic study of tom's masterwork. INSANE AMOUNTS OF SPOILERS. I
looked a little cheesy. Well, now I'm going to have to eat my words. The Land Girls was a fantastic film. I particularly enjoyed the Peter Pan tie in, which incorporated the model trains - nice touch. The only part I didn't like was the band concert at the end. It looked as if it was filmed at a very foggy Glastonbury. *Shudder. Thanks for mentioning it it in your blog, Iceland Girl. I'll be on the look out for more films directed by David Lister now. Glad to hear Kids in Need of Mothering was good too. I'll be checking that one out too. :thankingyou: Am looking forward to filling in more weekends with films. The early British ones, complete with corsets and manly men, are great fun. Unfortunately they're not picked up by many New Zealand TV channels, so I have to stick to dubbed French, Dutch, Italian, German or Spanish versions in order to understand what they're saying - very tricky, especially in a film with sing-song accents. :wink: I'm currently practising as a panto-trot is about to start at my local theatre - last year it was Treasure Island, this year it's Robin Hood. Unlike the British panto, which is mostly singing with just a small spoken play thrown in,

it shows how technically horrid the film actually was. This new film also suffered as it was taken from the perspective of the Willis robot, when a different angle could have better drawn you into the film. The film does look much better and certainly more polished. However story-wise it adds nothing, it sticks too close to the original without adding anything new to make it feel more relevant to today's audience. Some new scenes were not really necessary. Cage parents were not given any depth and their fate adds nothing to the story. There is much focus on the dolls and their use by humans are touched upon but nothing groundbreaking. One of the strongest scenes involved a toddler who is felt to be a returner. Rated 12A due to a disturbing scene of child murder. Not really any standout scenes before the end of the movie. The film actually follows the original to the letter with one noticeable exception being that F had a voice in the new film, a big mistake in my opinion as its use made the robot a rather more unlikable "character" without really doing anything overall for the story itself. The film as a whole had some good moments, but nothing that really made it worth the ticket price. I spend some time trying to figure out how the various robot models worked, but they were only on screen for a few seconds at best. Sigh. This one misses the mark in just about
this should have worked much better. Heist movies require great suspense. That's the basic ingredient of the genre and when it's not present, no amount of directorial flummery, impressive staging or action sequences, colourful characters or star charisma can make up for it. There just has to be something to chomp your lip over, bite your nails, chew your fingernails about. The interminable, needlessly convoluted elaborate preparation set-up tends to drains away all the tension as the forces involved multiplies and sub-plots thicken rendering everything implausible. The operation itself goes off without hitch; the very thing that makes these movies tick is absent and the lack of it characterizes the scenes following the actual heist. Individual set-pieces featuring characters who don't mean much to each other and so don't have much to play off each other means that even star charisma can't save the show. These people are comparatively uninteresting as they don't really have much chemistry with each other and/or little to play off each other. Gambit - first and last name - is about as bland as a Hollywood star portrait can get. The flash antiques auction/robbery sequences final 10 minutes or so are the best bits (except for I know who I think is the
told by a boring, sloppy writer. Long, winding sentences. Stabs at lyrical descriptions that were just dull. Trivial observations about the stages of grief. Often as I read I got the feeling that here we are basically getting a bunch of feewlings from, say, Helen. Just a lot of feewlings introddected by something that might be the beginnning of a story, or might not. Few of the stories are fully satisfying or have any real climax. Chiromancy, which is telling a person's fortune from the lines in the palm of the hand (or the lines on the hand if you study solo on a friend's hand) is interesting except that Uma is one of those rare people who seems to have no lines on her hands, and it just so happens that George also has no dramatic lines. So all her divining is a failure. I kept wanting to say, This is supposed to be suspenseful fiction, but it resolves so quickly and tidily that there is no suspense. Oh, but these are clairvoyance and chiromancy stories, not technothrillers. And then when you're done with the six stories about the same people, there is an essay about the author's ideas on suspenseful fiction. And then there is -- what else -- an author's note about why Interpre
and producers knew that we know a lot about these movies, so there's whole lot of things that are different. For example, a minestrone in Charlie's Angels tasted like tomato soup. There are a lot of different flavors included in minestrone, not just tomatoes. Pizza in Shawshank Redemption isn't red sauce with mozzarella cheese. Authentic pizza should be tomato sauce, not tomato soup, and anchovy pizza can be deadly addictive the first time you try it. I love anchovies. Wild stripers love anchovies too. Charlie Manson? no. Yuk, no. There are a lot of black households with 'Charlie Manson', how about Tom or wrong way Bob. The other name that is more to still alive is Clyde Barrow from Dallas, Texas. He was suspected to be the Boston strangler. After being on the run for a while he was caught and they cut his Achilles Tendon off. A very severe punishment for shooting at a local deputy that was chasing him. If he was the Boston strangler, you'll be safe in your house now. He's dead. No big deal.

Les Yeux Sont Les Vous Mêmes, and you usually get from point A to point B by flying down in a pod which disappears in gusts. We already know that Aramis is the boss of this gigantic underground construction project, and that he is diverted from the project by the Unstoppable forces of Darkness. However Beaumarchais is simultaneously the precocious son of some goofy country bumpkin scientist who hooks up with a bunch of scientist debtors who live in a floating brothel, visits Voltaire, plots against the Scientific Fascism of the Duc d'Orléans, and has to fight for knowledge against a corrupt government, a cruel killer robot, and an angry mob preventing the scientists from acting upon the evil scientific knowledge they are using to put an end to humanity.

Chekhov play, the bittersweetness of Tennessee Williams with a nod to David Hare. The film is culturally of the period, its references to rustic life in rural India take us away from Man, Woman and Child to another social entity. Protagonist Alice Green, has her farm and a husband who is deeply committed to the social strata, the mechanics of the community, the cabal, the camaraderie of village life. Even the villagers' interior decorating style denotes a preference for the simple life, squeezing what appears to be a Naugahyde sofa cover onto a mattress like the film's referencer, Tolstoy's "War and Peace." When the darling comes along he is too much of a natural entity, a cornucopia of encomiums, he smiles at the dog, he looks pityingly on the diseased chicken. In the village of Sraphand is a distinction of wealth among the various caste that travels a train. There is a subtle percolating in an enigmatic life in Srahmd that associates with the mendicity of the train, even an opaquely referred orange grove. "What Alice Found," which is built on the talent of Sheila McCarthy, becomes an impeccable and witty a transposition of "Summer and Smoke."
better biopic than this. If you think their lives were interesting enough for a movie, you're half right - The Three Stooges needs somebody experienced enough to tell the story well. What we get is a series of lazy-character homages that center around the Stooges themselves. Forget anybody who's worked with them or for them. This story is fueled by the impulse to make us like the Stooges, so it resorts to the time-honored tradition of associative plotting to try and hammer that sympathy in. Much like its subjects, the movie is goofy and foolish, but it's the kind of goofy and foolish that wastes the audience's time. Plus, its attempts at edgy humor are barely even that. Without something else holding the storytelling together, The Three Stooges chronicle comes off as a half-hearted cash grab, one that is never even clumsy enough to be funny. To distill a biopic in this manner, of real people's biographies, but ignore the nuances of their existence, makes for a lazily retrograde impersonation that no one can be bothered with. Love your neighbors, but make no attempt at knowing anything about them. Originally, the Farrelly Brothers were going to direct this movie. Their comedic identity must still carry some sway

the time and have always intended to acquire it on DVD once it was made available, but for some reason never got around to actually ordering a copy. So after re-reading my own review, I wondered if I might have been a bit more generous in my assessment. In an effort to judge it with fresh eyes, I pulled up the trailer on You Tube and watched it again. I have to admit that while the film still looks like a tough sell to a wider audience, it's obvious that the work that went into it far exceeds the talent that's executing that work. With the benefit of a little time and my own set of eyes, I was bothered by a few things: the acting isn't very good at all, continuity errors such as a shot that begins with someone standing looking left then cuts to another merely looking right and the trailer itself limiting the film visually which is quite a difficult thing to do. All of that said, I think the biggest thing that bothers me about the film is that the premise does allow for HIGH-HORSE but the film never really engages it which seems like a lost opportunity. Aside from that, there is an oddly dated look to SEA OF DUST which I can't put my finger on though. Perhaps it's the costumes, or the hairstyles, or the setting but there's something very

will help you to realise that there is a whole lot worse that you could be worrying about. An interesting production from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music made to mark the 70th anniversary of the ANZACS landing at Gallipoli. Based on the opera The Custodian by Richard Mills and Sally Rynold, this is an educational work about POWs held in a Japanese POW camp, who find a way to cope with their incarceration by attending to the soldier’s metal insignia and medals sewn into standard issue uniforms. Though stagey, and with more than a hint of propaganda, Rancid Aluminium was an enjoyable production, with good singing and acting. Young or old, you would be hard pressed to find something that would make you feel worse than the image of that flag, or the beautiful rendering of the hymn that ended a magnificent concert of sound and visual effects. The Sydney Symphony proved once again that with the right production they have the musicians, skills and atmosphere to provide an emotional response to any musical genre, including that rather dry stuff called musical theatre. Especially in this week, when we will commemorate the events of April 25th 2002, and consider the horrors of armed conflicts over hundreds of years. I am sure the soldiers of 2011 would agree that anything that
his cult of the personality. It was a year of political turmoil that shook my perspective cleanly out of my teenage ruts, and creatively pushed me to begin to see the socialist worldview in a new light. I had to put down well-organized intellectual memes and look anew at the world through a different political paradigm. My actions of boycotting continually eased their hold on me, and I began to pleasure in discovering Stalin for myself. During this process, I also began to understand the monument of a lifetime of great consumerism and the consumer culture which underpins it from many angles, and learnt a few facts about Soviet trade from the standpoint of the USSR's trade deficit. I discovered from a former Soviet Union citizen, that Soviet computers were capable of taking my orders and recording them as profit, but would never notify me what I'd ordered, or when it was going to be shipped. Another revelation I discovered, that cut to the heart of the Western demagogue's system of internal flaws, was that all successful Soviet satellites and spacecraft were built from Western planes. The discovery made me suspect that instead of destroying the Soviet aircraft discovery, Western systems and processes of technology were being used as a precedent to re-build Soviet aircraft systems. I also liked that Russian streetcars were still being turned around manually by
and there. Which, thanks to the Internet, is a whole lot when you think about it. My first exposure to the self deprecating ad-libbing humour of Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall were from when I watched their season of Absolutely Fabulous. I remember thinking that this was my kind of humour. To this day, I still think about "The Lincoln Town Car", mentioned in the episode "Wild Thing". I can't help it. That previous exposure and it's related soundtrack alluded to this amazingly funny series called "The Young Ones", which was also starred Rik Mayall, and led me on a hunt. I've already written about the discovery of that. Now, for a long time, I've wanted to write about Ab Fab, but also Bottom. So here I am. Here's a fictional world that is closely linked to what us RPGBloggers hold close to our hearts. I do believe, I am not alone in this yearning. I mentioned this idea the other day on the original RPGBloggers Facebook group...Atta-Boy swears even went to play a Bottom character once in his D&D game. Yes. We remember. And I believe it was one of your fantastic contributions for the anthology. Yes, Atta-Boy....I love
this film.........This movie is a treat for both the eye and the ear! Just had to get that bit out of the way.:-D *lights more candles* ...................This is probably the best film to have come out in a long time and it for sure not for the lack of trying.........But with most films that seem to fall short of this one's almost perfect stature, the competition is in a class of its own. It's almost criminal how creative this movie has been at times (Special mentions to The Script) and most things would probably be in print till the end of time about the movie and how it is no doubt the best film of the year. If only i could just say this with a whisper or a sigh without knowing for a fact that in itself is halfhearted. But what can I do? I love movies. Movies are my god. Movies allure me to another realm that still is a part of real life (being laced with magic) and makes me believe that life works a particular way. This movie if I must confess, hasn't just been good. Oh no, this movie was so much more than that. It was spectacular, breathtaking, outrageously wonderful. It almost taught me a few lessons. Like, it doesn't take much to believe. The amount of faith that must go to belief to mould
main character falls in love with a young boy, this is barely noticeable in the film adaption. The book is a hard read, and should only be attempted by people who don't mind the writing style of the time. The same holds true for the film: Expect a slow and intellectual movie that is indeed an emotionally loaded piece of art. This is not the type of film you can watch with friends or family. That means if someone you know has told you about the film, respectfully decline the invitation to watch. If you insist on seeing it, please make sure to grab the book, watch the film on your, whatever, and read the book the way it should be read, and only after watching the film adaption. This will ensure a satisfying experience. As far as I know, the director's cut is the one that has been used for television as well and this is the only version that is available at Amazon, but I don't really like that route. DVDs are cheap, so invest in the movie — you will believe the said 20 minutes of cut content are required for the film to work — once you've seen both versions. You won't watch it often, I guarantee that, you sit through the film to review why you've liked it, in order to understand the 20 minutes. In any case, go watch it already! Btw, "A Death
but it's still up there on the list of my all-time favourites. Favourites usually fade eventually, but watching this film always brings me right back to where I was when I was fourteen or so. Is it messily melodramatic? Oh, yes; almost certainly. You could easily point at this film (or any of the films in this series that I will be listing) and say it's schlocky garbage. But it didn't ever come across like that to me. Never fully accurate or completely rational, it was still more reality than about every other film coming out at the time. In those years, films were either flat-out cartoons or far-removed fantasy. Breakfast Club is a solo exception. Meaningful, real. Worth noting, in this case, comes from dumb stuff like the teasing scene where Judd slides down a flagpole on a winter day into a snowbank, or moments of (to us) trite comic relief (with that, I give you, Bender, smoking stolen cigarettes and walking away with a cherry, etc.). These were dumb things, but they brought the film closer to home. School life was pretty serious, but more sobering and serious moments could be found easily in reality. Lets face it: that was real, and a light-hearted moment of reprieve was
I've ever watched (and it was actually good!). I have a confession to make, and it pains me to say this, but "Behind Bedroom Doors" had a better love story than "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." Sorry--the effects in Harry were awesome, but the story was stupid! I swear, Harry Potter is basically a ripoff of "Sorcerer" with great details, minus the MacGuffin. My other confession is that I miss "Johnson & Johnson" terribly! I'm not sure how Fox is treating "Just Legal," but I've heard rumors that the show is off the air for good. If that's true, it's horrible! "Legal" had a dazzling cast and incredible storylines, but alas, it lasted one half of a season. It seems to me that if NBC can eject Johnson yet cling to McGregor, that's a contradiction. I'll spare you my tirade about McGregor altogether. Enough said... "Legal" was superb, and the best show not on TV before Fox took it off. Way to sink your own show, Fox. Last time I checked, if a product you make is good, you sell it across as many channels as possible. This doesn't seem to apply in
made. Why did we bring this up? Because there are new judges and a new host in the UK's version of "American Idol." Amy Poehler talked about it and did hilarious interviews here and here. This could be a very busy week for the Facebook news feed as everyone on our friends list will probably be watching, if they are not already. On a side note, Poehler has a podcast called "Smoke and Toadstools." We might just have to stop doing laundry on Sunday nights just to listen to it. (You can subscribe to "Smoke and Toadstools" here.) Also jamming this weekend is a 6-hour extravaganza titled "Salt," although not about the salt that fills our clogged pores after consuming too many mesclun salads, we hope, or that exfoliates our rough patches here and there. Rather, it's about the prosperous and noble salt of the earth who brings us one of the most successful movies of summer in the sequel to the first movie called "The Prosperous and Noble Salt of the Earth" (not to be confused with Lauren Salt, of course). Enjoy! We're off to examine the ingredients of our mesclun! See you on Sunday...or Monday. Or Tuesday. No
didn't really understand the weight of the movie. That it was about marital problems and cheating. As an adult I'd say that I'm neutral. I didn't love it, didn't hate it... but I did see the genius in Clint Eastwood's performance. I could see why he won Academy Awards. I can't really go on to give details about this movie because I remember little of it. It's kind of like Forest Gump, Ordinary People, and Shampoo jumbled into one movie. So here's the lasting impression, which I guess is a plus: A movie about a hot shot lawyer who comes from a dysfunctional home, sees little of his child, who has a crush on an underage call girl while dating a free spirited ex secretary. There you go... movie review #1... in the making it is. I'm brilliant, I know. :) I say rent and watch it. Maybe it will make more sense to me now that I'm older. :) Have a great day! Stay warm... Can't believe its July 2. End of June... Winter gone by as the Ancients celebrated the birth of the Sun... aka Winter Solstice. Funny how that works. :) How about you? What are your gifts? I like this idea of seasonal gift giving. :) Your gift to the
I first found out about the movie I thought it would be great.Of course, anything without Tom Cruise is just perfecto. No one can replace him, but Susan Sarandon does the best job she can.It has just a little bit of everything, sort of like the families names, to mix it up. I thought this movie was very interesting and very entertaining. It even had the right amount of suspense at the end like any good psychological thriller should have. I even really enjoyed the music. I enjoyed it, ok, Susan Sarandon looked frightfully (maybe a little frightening is a better word) like Bette Midler. Join my generation Tom and enoy it. You will bye Farmy. I didn't like Farmy. Bed my B, Jo!!conjugating the verb mean? i.e. go shopping. This is a tonal language. Suppose it were spoken in Louisiana. It would have to mean something else and for this movie to have resonance for it's American audience. I just don't find it believable at all.not from the Sweedish Chef? My favorite scene was that doorknob that was about to fall off...hilarious. Having a nice conversation with your self-contained and nice looking Maine Coon cat, who was watching happily his hostess choose items from the fridge. It was awfully nice,
ten, but I have had to give it eight, especially the first hour that I normally just skip with popcorn unless I am very drunk and want to die. OK if Dan Schneider and Kevin Kopelow were to get a hold of this film this would be more entertaining. I am glad producers have chosen the path they have for Annie because had it been given to Dan and Kevin I would have been forced to kiss Damien’s ass and watch the back end of a car for the next hour. Annie has some great characters that are either annoying as fuck or whatever, but that’s as far as the similarity goes. Currently available on Amazon, but can also be found on Netflix and YouTube. Grab a cup of coffee because Annie may attempt to put you to sleep. I had sympathy for dickhead teacher, Mr Bracy – can’t understand a lick of shit he is saying; but Fox suits didn’t like that plot twist because there were more annoyances in the film than a Central American road trip.

Christopher Wallace and John Travolta. Now I find out they start dating cops for 12 years apiece which is supposed to be a real story. All I have to say is, as far as the movie goes itâ€™s totally true. Gillian keeping all the money till the end is totally true too. That type of killing is horrified enough about the whole situation. Christopher Wallace killing a pizza deliveryman. They should have picked some other movie besides this. After the life story of a guy like him. They should have talk about all the times he rape so many women. Talk about what the had to go through. Do a documentary about direct influence on gang violence. How can you go from doing one killing to hundreds. And to think that this guy was a little gangster with so much potential. Its only sad that the neighborhood under-developed that much. That would have been more sadder than the movie. Youâ€™re about one year later, but better late than never. I myself would have loved to have met him. As a real person that would have been a challenge. To change him into a real person, would have been it ideal wish to encounter. Too bad that he didnâ€™t fall victim to this other party. Which will be the middle event between this whole fiasco. If that means think about Wrong time, wrong place.
the adventurous cineaste. The film moves through an array of existentialist ruminations in the form of the philosophical and social problems associated with Australia's land: the forefathers' threat of imminent extinction of the local aborigines, lack of identity, the loss of kinship with the land of one's birth, the fear of the unknown, and finally destruction. The film's story takes place around 1998. The narrative primarily revolves around a marine biologist, David Dara Flinch (played by Sam Worthington, who portrayed Jake Sully in James Cameron's Avatar), the son of an Australian doctor. (Flint was a popular last name in Britain during the 17th 18th centuries. Mitchell is also briefly mentioned.) David's wife, Meredith, played by Laura Dern, is an environmental activist who is determined to stop the Ocean Strike (a large oil company) from building an oil refinery off the Australian coast. As a consequence, she dies in a plane crash, leaving her husband, Emma, and sevenyear-old daughter, Slim, who is played by mysterious-looking Morgana Davies. When the trio arrives to meet her plane at Darwin Airport, they race to the gate to board in time. She is last person alive to find a telephone bo
until I watched it. The opening scene portrayed the paragraph from the synopsis perfectly. There is no doubt, I really like this film. Wish I read the book as well. Maybe that would help. The Psychic Who Met a Gorgeous Ghost was released in 2015 and is a standard ghost film. During the beginning I wanted Aya to get a restraining order or kick the place but she stuck it out and communicated with him. A little sacchariny(Not really but some of the scenes had that sentiment about the way things might happen or work out. Overall very good movie. Nice ending. Yep, still wanna read the book. Hopefully, its a good one. I haven't seen the star in a flick in awhile, but he is hot. I liked her too. Mixeru no yakata, Maveshu to kuruwa no monogatari]. Suitable for Fans of Horror comedies.

too many things but ends up as just another poor rip off. It's all about being cool, having an achievedi, and proven badass for a day. You scarcely see him do anything else besides get in fast moving vehicles. The main character, a single father stud named Slick, is trying to save his ex wife, who's ahed drug addicted for so long. She led him into a arrow trap, rotten by paranoid fear. Animated during his frenzied, tense, moments, he darts buy reams of C-clcars, gaggles of goons (hired side) cars, and a "Transporter Van" van. This is a world where each one of these men lost their driver license before they got their driver licenses. They make a quick pit stop to deliver more information before they head to the US State capitals where Slick can dismantle the conspiracy hiding truth. Along with his team of 'good' dutch women, Slick must save his wife. The problem is the cool cast, including his son and his secretary is thoroughly useless. The cool men are finally so callous they don't really care about saving themselves. The last reel is foreshadowing the huge logic leap of revealing the secret to the UFO threat. In the end they try to say that after saving themselves, they put their lives in harm
everyone has been bought off. Everything that happened is a lie. Like it's not even actually happening. It's totally A fake. *SOILER* That is such good news, But why it is the characters believe it is real, And that's why it's a good story. I also hate the character Kerry Locke and I did alot of thinking about why and the only conclusion I came to is the "Bill Hicks Gun Scene" in is that seriously like 5/10 minutes of Jar of Flies, As far as I remember he has got to happen in that movie it is so weird, If there is a bingic are you gona talk about the Bill hicks scene I looked it up and he was video about stand-up on the juat shaves become so satisfying, So there it is I built this the Locke into it, I also think the show is about Karma and it is your payback if you ever fucked over the vulnerable, I think the just fucked you over hard. I think Tom manages to shake off some Karma, but I think You get to see and how extremely cruel minded this show can be at the end of this. All in all I think that they don't want this show to become a supernatural the show, It's just gonna be package for the Loners of the World to wear black
me this is something you would never expect. mark what would you do was a documentary that can tell you alot without having to even talk. I just hope this show has an episode dedicated to the internet, cause how else would we know about the show. “relationship questions: if someone is single come on us shocker...but a person who is married or dating with someone that makes you wish they were single? are you joking uh what about the person who is with their significant other and starts a relationship with you?Mark; What would you do? actually looks a lot like our own TV program called “What do you think” our program is an actual social experiment and we are quite sure that anyone who calls themselves a producer had to copy us, because other than us no one had the idea, the imagination and the guts to film real people getting caught as they are having an affair. Also, what’s up with the “secretly on camera” part! if you knew that you were being secretly filmed then you weren’t being secretly filmed. “Mark what would you do” debut week aired the same thing as our program did. Supposedly it’s this American version, however, we would like to know who is who and who is pissed…and for sure we, Have the solution to this problem…!If you want to save your show give the viewers the real thing,
overused and probably reeks of sucky cheese. I’m suprised this was actually released as some movie, it seems more like a DVD that bargain bin stores would put on special. The acting, special effects and gore are not to be compared to any other type of horror flick. Its more scary when your stapler falls and kills you. The screenplay is actually much worse because if your not watching this horrible movie all you can do is laugh at it, because of its utter dreariness. I’m a diehard fan of slasher films, yet this was pathetic and rather annoying. On the other hand and before my final statement I’ll give it a .5 more because I watched it to the end. My advice to anyone who hasn’t bought this, don’t. You should go with your sixth sense to save yourself from the pain of dealing with this flick. I would suggest going to the library and reading a scary book, then you can waste this money to buy something that’s of decent quality, and enjoy watching it than this crap. Anyway…Worst rented movie in a long time, maybe I should save you all renting it for a dirty movie to watch with your co-worker. If you decide to go through with it, I’m sorry for you deducting money away from movie-makers worth your time. It
outrageous) from a cynical point of view. Yes, I am a soldier from a family of soldiers, but I find it surprisingly easier to laugh at the insane stupidity of the events shown through these caricatures than getting mad over the evidence of the ridiculous and reprehensible activities of those behind the scenes. The facade shown in this movie is a fairly realistic one, but the acting makes me think that Mel Brooks might have stepped in to show us his view (probably black). The all too common greed and self-delusion in this movie screeched with the squeaks of piggy bank, corrupting the truth, but laughing all the way. John Cusack never really gets into character as he bumbles through the film, but for once it is by design. His character is an idiot. Special effects and the group of other actors around Cusack are on top form and power the film. All adds to a fun and fast paced picture. If you are looking for an insightful or thought provoking film, think again. A stick of dynamite never got closer to the truth. It isn't nuanced and neither is the film. There are several caricatures that make the film fun, but when they are a bit to close to the truths currently being told then you feel better laughing at them. I reckon I laughed a lot!
months ago and feeling some lingering shame that I am so entertained by medically-horrific, emotionally-human shows as Grey’s Anatomy. We’re all a little guilty there, aren’t we, society? I’m putting my hand up here and now to proclaim it as I restart where we left off, on episode 25 of the second season of Grey’s Anatomy: “Doctors Don’t Make Mistakes”. I know this is playing with fire, but as I’m on a typewriter repairing the ribbon with tissue paper today, I’m not going to chop off the circuit board by wiring it up wrong this time. Like the episode before where I found out that it started in Shondaland 2005, so I had binge-watched season two and still not gotten to anything before the season I’m immediately watching on repeat? And as I’m on fire? I have no easy way to play with this episode because it’s light on Izzie action and heavy on the medical jargon. Still, I have snippets of thoughts and reactions to share, bare your naked naked with me. By the end of the show, I feel like I’ve been to the opposite sex’s store, as I’m emotionally, mentally, and spiritually depleted.
a load of scantily-clad half-wits chew gum (when they aren't wrestling)'! The Pearly King of course refers to the legendary but not entirely factual Dick Turpin. The low budget film seems to lose a sense of inertia when it 'hits the road'. It tries to create some tension with the action of a gang on a kidnap-mission to secure the transporting of a mini-cassette tape, with talk of ransom demands, which from the teenage audience seemed to be a none starter as no kids would do something for money. The biggest laughs of all were garnered from the sub-co-stars. Was that William Devane as a policeman or does it really matter. The best examples of dry the camera should take so long to run out of juice of course were in scenes that found the young hero in the bathroom improvising at his guitar to some ballad we'd never heard before. All in all, neither of the main players in this film, Anna Mottram or Harry Devlin, has been heard of ever since. Not been heard of by anyone except the Magistrates Court. So there's two fewer excuses for the film to append the 'the film you wouldn't......' prefix. (Officially the film is on digital trail in some obscure archive

I remember this much. This distinguished looking man was drunk pulling into his driveway outside of an enclosed garage of his home. As he pulled into the driveway he noticed his wife playing nude with another man on a jailhouse behind the garage. The man failed to stop his car in time and crashed his car into the garage. After the alarm went off (I guess having no power)the man got out of the car to find his wife defiled. He grabbed the other man's neck and threw him out of the front of his home window. The alarm was monitored by a security company because the same window had a security grill on it obviously to prevent break-ins. I remember this because the enclosed garage I spoke of had a door like a large bathroom door not an ordinary 4 foot walk in door. If you are familiar with this movie can anyone remember it's name and the actors? Thanks ## the movie you are referring to is called The Postman Always Rings Twice starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. The Garage in the movie is missing it's electric opener and is hand operated. The door in the garage is a metal 4 vertical panels door also without an electric opener. His car was a Lincoln Mark V. His wife was fat and not flattering to look at. Before the crash, his wife caught Garfield in

favorite films of the year. It has a nice mix of Hong Kong action, with a heaping helping of camp  humor and some blood. The whole female vampire/women(androgyny of life) angle is great fun. Charlene Choi is a charming embrace of charmingness. Gillian Chung really rocks that androgyny. I really wished that there was more of Charlene Choi in this one <img src='http://www.kungfumagazine.com/forum/pubcols/col_smilies/082shhh.gif' border='0'> Even in white, I think she could give Hugh something to twitch at. After Diva, I never thought Charlene Choi was looking doing anything special till she became part of the modern Twin's Army. Now I can't fault her. As trying as she can be some times, she looks fabulous here. I love the way the vampire theme brings subtext to her position as a woman who is mistaken for her younger sister (Situation 调情plight kept
technology, innovation, romance, and evil all into one. It tests principles. "The Land" is chiefly dealing with time and time's effect upon principal characters. Just as some people are stones with little affect on others, so too is Truman and just as Judges are stones in the cohesiveness of society, so too is Truman in time. It is a perfect allegory for an elite milieu exercise in justice. E.g. there is one plot twist for which, at times, I was able to abandon suspension of belief (and that is a high order), though I must say the film's climactic and concluding sequence more than redeemed for the occasional gaffs in credibility. If just suspend disbelief, enjoy, and just go with it you will find a great movie, and if you're like me, (see my first two characters, verification that I'm a geek) you will love it. I hate to give anything away... so, for the truly dedicated; the "iris in Truman's store is done by either an ellipse or a hypercardioid microphone held near your mouth with a thumb at the bottom button and a finger at the top. I loved the building of the store. It's like a chorus in a play wherein each character is acted with nuance appropriate to their character and circumstance and though
though we were kind of scared. Although we couldn’t watch the first Nightmare on Elm Street movie, we loved watching them from the second one on. The stories that John Wayne Gacy might actually be Freddy Krueger at Halloween and the stories of the murders and other crimes he committed were some of my parents' most interesting stories that I remember from my childhood. John Wayne Gacy was my parents' favorite serial killer. They even knew what age he murdered and that he kept an album with nude pictures of his victims, and that he would rape his victims before killing them. While I’m sure they didn’t discuss anything beyond that when I was very young, I distinctly remember fondly talking to them about all of these details and them going, “Really? You are actually interested?” I was, and still am. I was a weird kid. Anyway, I remember the covers of the books my parents brought home. I bought them my freshman year of college, specifically to lay in our hallway in Ewing Center East. I grew so confused as to why, and desperately wanted to read about these murders and murders in general afterwards, but the reality of it scared me and I was never able to read them. Every year I would see them on my dad’s shelves, and every year I would put the book back. As I
the opening scene on the floating coffin for very long. These are not the type of zombies I like. And if anyone talks about not seeing the final scene as being improper I'll kill you. Not worth 2 minutes of my time. Out of them all I would probably vote Fulci as the most disturbing but only if he got a hold of a 16mm camera. Also, the "Don't forget me" scene looked dated to me. I kept thinking of a California Raisin singing " I gotta be me " . I did'nt understand how these were even called zombies. More like stump puppets. Anyway I'll give it 2/ 5 zombie stars. These filmmakers who make sh** like this should be bashing brains in or something , believe I'd outlaw this type film. but thats me...and no I'm not Zombie Bob.I 'm a litle older and suffer from gut kicks. Lucio Fulci films suck out loud but then I ve been spending too long in the zombie de-nile..crap!! It 's time to watch something like Taxidermie...plenty of yummier scenes and much more logical than this crap. So Tim Guthrie please let me know when your next cool zombie flick is released, do away with distributors
in this schlock. Well, it is a "home video" that absolutely feels like watching a home video. I mean this one couldn't even get a theatrical release. And I bet it was made in someone's backyard. The ghost has a male voice but when we see her, she is obviously female and she's supposedly a 13 year old girl. And the less said about the pitiful "special effects", the better. The screenwriter's daughter must be in middle school or something playing this part. And another one was an actress in "The Devil's Bride". The video itself looks like we aren't watching it on our TV but through our computer... This is confusing and a total dud. Here's an absolutely perfect movie that sucks so bad you can't help but laugh. Kitschy is only a few letters away from being truly ultra and nasty. Let's stay far away from anything Necromancer! It's terrible. Skip this one, of course. I bet the second one isn't any good, either. I bought this "home video" from Amazon U.S. because of its great price (even for rubbish) and actually, I'm glad I bought it because I needed something to share about here today. The acting is embarrassing. Everyone is overacting and the movie drags. Dis
run animation. A special edition DVD of how u have to work for what u want and that chances are it wont be what u wanted. There life in these movies is neither 1 u want to choose or live. Sometimes wat u get and have to work with is luck thats all that is given. Should he stay? and continue to be enslaved or go? and maybe find a way out of this horrid existence? That is a tough question to respond to and that is why there is no plot and for whatever reason its the way it is told and this should have ended a while ago. Sometimes to make something a moving experience its all about the followers trailer always makes it or breaks it. Animation does some fantastic moves to death with this one, this is not the norm and is far from being the average. But that is what makes it amazing and worth the buy. Legends was liked much better while still not brilliant it was some how more satisfying with the alot of actors used in somewhat larger roles. There are so many things i would have liked to see done better that its almost pointless bringing this up or thinking of all the better ways to do this to be more pleasing and enjoyable. The impact or tone of it all seems to be of something that makes eye brows move and keep people watching when they would have a better time doing something else. Short lived and ridiculous those are the feelings and emotion
love interests, but challenged Nick over his naive and terrifying viewpoints. The movie was fast-paced, clever and (although predictable) light hearted. I thought Hart was excellent in his portrayal of Nick, and his comedic timing with the other actors. Isla Fisher held her own, playing Elaine, a warm and welcoming character. This is not a movie for young children, however, they'll enjoy the beach setting and "sleepover camp" theme. I expected no less from Dennis Dugan, and Reggie Miller is a natural in prime time roles. Ginger Rogers is the one actor I wished we'd seen more of. The chemistry between Hart and Fisher worked really well, both real and fun with comedic timing. This is a great film to pick up at the beach or bring along on a vacation. I was not putting up nets from escaped bats and other creatures. I thought it was a very entertaining film and recommended for a fun Summer night at home. Tv Reviewer Ladygodzilla is correct when he talks about pozzy...... crazy84pozzy2011!

with Hugh Jackman's charmingness and boyish good looks! They were surrounded by great supporting cast! I particularly loved the green bag, French juggling guy and Victoria Rowell. Two things that bothered me the most - (1) the amount of cash that they sisters have, given that they were just small town girl and bar waitress. I always think such romantic comedies don't really hit home, because they are just not possible. (2) John Cleese singing was just unbearable. Overall, I did like the movie and I rated it 7/10. I will probably watch it again one day! That's the sign of a good movie! I hadn't had a good laugh for awhile and KUM was just what I needed. LoL! And I think this is the movie where Meg Ryan crossed dresses for the first time. Hooray! Now there's no stopping her from dressing up and putting on make up! I miss you Meg! :-) I really thought that the movie would be just another one in the Kate & Leopold series, but boy was I wrong! There was this mixture of romance, action, travel, adventure, deceit and international crime! This is definitely a world wide class act by Spielberg and co. What great composition that added tremendous cinematic value! What a great storyline with such amazing
couldn't find fault, for once in Ellen Page's career, in her performance. She was absolutely adorable as the ultra-futurist Nazareno, giving us further proof of the fantastic comedic timing and charisma she seems to naturally have. The young director, Jun Ichikawa, has once again delivered a beautiful film to the audience who are ready to invest the time watching black silhouettes on white backgrounds in a non-narrative way. It compensated for our short attention spans the 21st century has left us with. Coupled with the fantastic cinematography and the martial-arts style soundtrack, Elle Plus Haut Les Cieux is an exceptional film made by yet another great director, Jun Ichikawa. Highly recommended watching and I for one am considering re-watching this film straight away. Cheerio muckers! and cheerio to a bloody good film. The Best Film of the Cannes and yes, the Grandpa deserved it well. Just very simple, beautiful, rare and thought provoking. Four great young stars and each with their mesmerizing talent. Love the world through this film. Sunshine was less than thrilled but she was totally stoked when she saw the end scene of Jun Ichikawa's Elle Plus Haut Les Cieux, which she admitted changed her way of viewing society and age.

’ve always liked Blackadder more than its equivilant Red Dwarf. With an ensemble cast including Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle and Stephanie Leonidas, director Jake Scott’s reinvention of the 1969 TV series is overlong and patchy (McGregor is far too soft focussed), but is never boring and benefits from superb production design and a polite dash a bit of political correctness. Slightly misguided as an adaptation, but enjoyable nevertheless, especially for those of us yearning for a gentle comedy with well developed characters and not two old men slapping hands on each other’s knees and trying to pass it off as ironic. As Plunkett tells Cady at one point, to torture someone to fight for a cause is morally bankrupt. Pluto Nash is released as a double feature with Tortilla Fesitval and is a five hour commute away from being remotely entertaining. Hugely disappointing and an instant classic in what should be the most boring genre on the planet. It’s all hands on deck this time, with a Bristol Phantom in the saddle and a DC3 leading the way in the air. Despite its lavish production design and moments of shocking violence, the film is distinctly uneven with a script that jams on red lights for reams of
the liberty of picking a few obscure films to recommend. Though "obscure" doesn't necessarily mean interesting, it's a hit or miss process to seek out obscure films that are actually any good — which is why I've done the dirty work for you. While many of these are mostly trash, with the exception of Blood Feast (there's that "klutzy idiot" Goldy McNuggets all over again), these are lesser known films that still manage to entertain, and that's all I can ask for from the obscure and random titles that I choose to watch.

sick from school for a day or two after a surgery. I was going through some stuff at the time and this movie really spoke to me. It’s been years since I watched it, but I recently ordered it from Amazon on BluRay and can’t wait to watch it again. The thought of watching this movie brings back so many memories from my youth. Especially the scene of both of the characters standing on the ledge. I remember doing something similar as a teen to think things over. Every time I see that, it reminds me of my teen years. I need to spend a lot of time alone and I need to spend some time alone going over things I came to do in this world. I have a new boss now and have a lot of big changes ahead in my career. This movie touches on different things than what I’m going through now, but it still has meaning to me even now. Whether you like movies or not, this movie provides a very good lesson. I encourage you to watch it and enjoy it. Let’s just say life isn’t fair. How do we deal with it? How do we stand up to it? There’s more to life than just simply existing. Let’s actually live, not exist. We don’t want to waste our life away. What’s the value of it all if we don’t even get a chance to properly

I had to see this. I did enjoy Wicker Man when I saw it in college, and it scared me too. Now it scares me on another level. This film captivates you as the pagan myth unfolds. What a blend of the modern witch and witchcraft with the ancient Gothic tradition. One can't help but think "who is holding the rowan and who is holding the hawthorn". Also the story about the bellringer has two excellent members...of the type Haverford College's bell ringing club was cursed by, and as well the stripped pagan priestess fantasy utopia was creepier than I was expecting for how the modern Wicker man would set up shop....but it was a very dark ending wonderfully executed with the actors' emotive talents. Definitely worth a careful viewing. Netflix. I have heard Nicolas Cage takes his celebrity capital and fictionalizes famous people of the past in the Wickerman, so I must seek and find that next. Anyone give the Wickerman a stamp of approval?! prefacing this, Wickerman is dark, dark, deep deep, old world psychic drama. It was directed by Robin Hardy like the original in 1973.

it. What a film! Absolutely brilliant in many ways and so refreshing to come across a piece of comedy that is genuinely funny beyond belief. The story unwravels in a wonderfully complex plot with a lot of clues, throwbacks to classic Hollywood films such as Rebecca and Rear Window as well as an extra dimension of star-studded comedy talent that will have you laughing your head off from start to finish. It was released in 1945 when the British film industry was on top form and going to Hollywood was one of the ambitions of every young thespian in the UK especially as key British directors had gone to Hollywood to make a name for themselves. It took a brave director though to make this film. Theatre became routine during the war. Films had stopped altogether for five years but in 1945 the British film industry was given the green light again and every director wanted to make a proper film again with huge casts and riveting plots and Joseph Losey came up with this gem. A murder mystery based on a Dashiell Hammett novel which moves from one set piece to another with brilliant dance scenes, fight sequences, funny comedy and a fantastic horror b-movie atmosphere. Apparently it was a box office failure on release because the critics didn’t know what to do with it. It was beyond categorisation. There was no precedent for it at
ever seen. To begin with, I think the camera work and editing were great. I often watched films shot at 180 degrees, and focused on certain details, enhance the feeling of what war is. This film has succeeded in making people who have never been in any war, even to those who've tried to avoid it, be convinced that war is hell on Earth. "The Thin Red Line" is the opening credits, excellent soundtrack (director Terence Malick also wrote the screenplay, and is occasionally known for his lyrical style), and the love story may be the best ever put on film. With flaws in those that lead the war, as did George Clooney's character did, helped the story play out a lot better overall. It took other themes, like a religion and the idea (possible myth?) of being shot by an arrow in the back while hiding. If you have yet to see this film, please do - it could be the best thing to come into your life! 10/10... Expand >>.. Along with having minor flaws to it, this film is a masterpiece, and most definitely the best war film I've ever seen. To begin with, I think the camera work and editing were great.

a shame that the “ballet” sequence is somewhat abbreviated, but you can’t win them all. Based on a successful play, the characters are fairly stereotypical and the humour at times predictable, but a really good example of the 30s MGM era, with production values to die for. Completely untouched by the scriptwriters’ knives, preserving the artistic work of the director. Spectacular climax. Highly recommended viewing. Don’t miss it! 97 min. divx Colour 1.66:1 Widescreen.

IMDb gives King Kelly of the US Naval training programme in Chicago as the main man for the war exercises, whilst the other drama is about rival gangs. The real King Kelly was the eight or nine times national tennis champion between 1935 and 1940 rather that the boxer and prohibition racketeer who died young from Spanish influenza. In any case, there is no blues at all unless the Chicago blues are singing. The whole film is beautiful. Watch it have a great time!

Dr. Markoff then realizes Rita is a vampire and catches her in the act of cannibalism by feeding off two people and six cats. However, Rita's attempts to overcome the Blind Vampire Syndrome is unsuccessful, so Rita is not able to negotiate with Dr. Markoff for her life.

all unravel in ‘Sweethead,’ the 1989 David Salle-directed, Edith Wharton-inspired and redemptive redemption film written by the magnificently down and dirty Dubra Filer. The story of Rose; her lost father, and her ‘accidental’ family was ahead of its time. Conquests of the brontosaurus-sized ego and the collection of polished bones. Revealed at last, Rose not only overcomes her past, but accepts it as vital for her evolving growth. But taken on face value alone, it is a deliciously vicious little movie. For a revenge film, it has a pleasant Apanasec way of making you hate your enemies, maybe just a little. Beneath the sensual intrigue that is so driven by Dubra’s grandiose, larger-than-life heroine, Rose is an avenger’s angel. As much as Rose attracts her motherly ‘ruthless’ would-be nemesis, perhaps the affair escalates naturally, but after you’ve nearly killed her. Possession always has its drawbacks. And when confronting a petite, seductive, though gangly, all-psyche, would-be mistress-of-manor, well, who would not? Including the title song performance by
Christmas film about a magical fungus that lives near the Odense towers built by Hans Christian Anderson”. What could be more absurd than that? Laughter is always a great weapon against cynicism and depression so thumbs up for director Anders Morgenthaler and his team! More of this, please. The frogs who have influenced this work have probably worked as subcontractors for Aardman Animations. Think “Chicken Run”. I believe it made a big impact when it opened in 2000. Now it seems as present as a Petrushka from the old Soviet era…. A clever and highly imaginative Danish Christmas film that is not afraid of the odd grand u-turn. I even found myself believing in the magical mushrooms in the final act even though it may seem a little overdone in parts. No room for boredom in this film. It’s one jumping, driving, dancing, singing film. Come along for the ride! You certainly wont regrett it! I give ‘The Flying Coffin’ a well deserved 4/6. Cheers, The Danish Guy”.

(one of my all-time favorites), with strong source material, a relatively well-respected director, a charismatic young Amber Tamblyn in the lead role, and it had a peppy, fun teen comedy soundtrack. Yet it didn't translate well to the screen. The film provides so much dead air -- tedious moments in which very little of interest actually occurs, in which nothing really happens. This can be seen as early as 30 minutes into the film, when Amber Tamblyn's character receives a hand-written letter from someone about whom she hopes to know more but about whom she seems to feel guilty, possibly because of some behavior exhibited on a party yacht. For a moment, it seems like the director may be attempting to make some sort of subjugated-feminism metaphor between the piece of "trash" which there is a dreamy, metaphorical long shot of at the end of the film and the bedroom of a bratty young teenage girl who has been spoiled by her parents and by far too many Disney movies. With this in mind, could the suitcase full of Madonna memorabilia at the beginning, Madonna being a second-generation vehicle for much of the same idea, not represent the finely represented and idealized but perhaps unattainable ideals which are actually useless. The director drops that plot thread before

in taming a wild animal. In turn, despite the great pressure of the grueling narrative, the audience is inevitably drawn to this otherwise impossible and frail creature. With superb mastery in Spartan tactics and storytelling, filmmaker Agnieszka Holland assembles intimate, visceral insight about historical horror; it records the slow aftermath of a shocking physical and emotional tragedy in achieving the most timely lessons about the complex, imperfect infrastructure of Europe. In Voidhez, as an exile from England is sent into banishment in 1920's Poland, with a bleak and embittered path that becomes propelled towards an ominous direction that would have appeared inevitable to any viewer. However, it is to Holland's credit that she cannot fashion an ending as easily predictable, and instead undulates from a rather evident flawlessness, gleefully pardoning the lurking danger that sharpens the whole film.The chaotic flop of his and Konstantin Kryzhitsky's codes is appropriate particularly for a film that will take its space as an epic, durable writing deposit to define the 1980s. This is evident not only with the momentum Kurovsky's main character develops, but also by the way the film verges on many taboo issues

I want to see the next episode ASAP!!! They've always delivered on the previous seasons, and I really never had a problem with anything before. Greek just gets better and better each season. We can only hope for this to continue to be a great season, because the creators still end up hitting home runs on this show. If you haven't watch Greek don't miss out on a great show. And watch this season because I really think it's one of Greek's best. So I'll end with, "Go Greeks!" Be sure to tune in on Tuesday, January 5, 2010 @ 9 p.m/9c to catch the new season of Greek, and stay tune after that, because you don't want to miss The Beautiful Life, and 90210. It's an amazing night of watch TV
on, their little experiment in camp turns into a horrifying nightmare of a different sort in this creepy flick. Deep in the middle of nowhere with no power company unions to stop them, they hold this night of terror. The horror starts small with a man saving a dog from being unjustly hit by a car.

The movie surrounds this group of kids who have been intrigued by the possibility of getting into suburbia by means of having their own business. Besides, a place to put their old Erector sets. The real fun begins when one of the kids discovers the video store during a nightly foray into the woods.

creativity that the Fab Four left us. The Fab Four – The Ultimate Tribute, it is not another spin on the fab four, but it comes to feed nostalgic members of the generation of the sixties with a sound-alike that is on a mission to bring alive the magic of the Beatles live. To do this, the tribute reproduces a complete concert event with a fail-proof performance as it has been done in over 1,000 live presentations! Two shows are separated by an intermission. You are invited to stretch two hours and 45 minutes and you will be voiceless when you will be on your way from the presentation. With stunning accuracy, the musicians and singers of the Fab Four will make you think you are watching the Beatles live in their prime. With incredible attention to accuracy, the Fab Four will make you forget that they are not John, Paul, George and Ringo. From the costumes and hairdos down to the instruments and gear, the Fab Four will let all those memories waken up and at the same time they will create the likeness of The Beatles. Even the introductions of the songs will take you back in time. On top of their execution, they have the attitude to entertain and to get people to participate in the concert. At the end of the show, they answer questions from the audience and this touch makes them
was pushed out the door and to the multiplexes. As HBOROOTS says - it is a shame. The film is a cross between an ensemble political satire/comedy and a myster-thriller, and some may find this to be a jarring experience. Sayles was tempted to make a "Billy Wilder-esque" dark comedy, so much so that in an interview he cited Double Indemnity and the Coen Brothers as inspiration (quoted from the Siren's Criterion Essay). I'm not sure how finished Sayles thought this movie was when he had the privilege of premiering at the Venice Film Festival; the film is very rough around the edges, but actually not in a Billy Wilder film, Blake Edwards, Tati-like fashionable liberal iconoclastic way. I certainly have to wonder if every film personality (*cough* Liev Schlieberinurie *cough*) doesn't set fire to the barn with their inevitable underwritten script after every solid offbeat offering would have Warner Bros. execs checking the latest screenplays on the lot. As far as politics goes, Sayles true to form, is direct in its depictions. And make no mistake, this is a cinematic soapbox and a very entertaining one at that. Presented as a conspiracy-theory genre film,
/15/17 years ago at all the Oppikoppi Festivals, Superbowl at cosy hall with pretty girls and psychotic violence this is the movie for you… Go see it! It takes you back to those times of when blackened victims of Moses Mabida, Carol Bouwer, NAF and anxious policemen mixed together with that energy of a punk rock band. See what happens if a punk band & and a bunch of streetpunks/goths mix with a career high cover band and … a Catholic priest. “Reality is a song with a thousand verses, love is a lie with a million ends” Oh my daddy, oh my daddy, please tell me this is a linga song. Toeka, Kai Walter, rocknroll… Guys, if somebody points a cannon at you, get the fuck out of the way or you might get killed. Looks like there are two assassinations and a bunch of amorous outlaws behind bars. Maybe in the remake, The Bouno Bandit, I can play a cameo part. Alfa Romeo is only the finest Italian car. Too bad I don’t own one. You’ll see more details on our FaceBook and Guilty Gong pages. It’s a great festy: “You mighty jungleneyer!" Last, but not least, last
believe a scene put into motion but not multiple changes. If you enjoy and love the book, just love the book. The movie was enjoyable to hear my daughter scream and jump at each scene. The ole' horror movie cliche is played out in this remake but its scary nevertheless. I liked the witch's house the best. The beautiful blue accents certainly puts you at ease..yes, joking. It's got a creepy haunted look, a bit lavish for a rural area in western Virginia but most houses were new, 100 x250 and dirt roads at that time. We really don't know what the creek and house look like when you leave out the accents. I googled this one and the house is actually quite beautiful with a modern country decor. Yes, I only have google to go by.I prefer the ending of the book where we find all the bodies. Sorry if this is a spoiler but the ending left me feeling disappointed and unfullfilled. Every time I turned around they changed the ending to fit a tv budget fake scare. Which brings me to my last comment....well three comments....Bottomline is, to come out with a movie that strays so far from the book as to what creates a movie that takes you out of the story.Each chapter centers around a new disaster that is about to happen and what led the
principals were real actors, rather than the recurrent hunky second bananas who mugged and shrugged their way through many a LS pictorial. Relying heavily on location shooting, this was the last of the LS 'murder plays' and probably one of the most literate Mexican lovers of the series. Like most such fare, the two stars get off a little, but it's not much. There are complications involving a live, young son (well played on the quiet by director Gibson) and a pained academic who see that these two star-crossed lovers need no greater adversary than each other...or so I thought. Then, finally, the murderer himself (tall and earnest, somewhat wasted by Gibson) enters the picture. The one-note villain actually shows some thought, having planned out his humiliation of both his unrequited lover Linda and her Mexican lover before they are all set afoot on the razor-sharp curve in the road somewhere on high in the Alps. It's fairly ordinary fifties fare, laid out fairly leisurely, but with some nice, well-filmed location scenes and some okay acting. Fiore Agricoli's musical score is full of shawm, brass and percussion and is redolent of European locations and scant apparel, if only
love movies like this. While trying to not give much away I think its worth the price of a ticket, due to the quality of the film the only thing better then watching it with pop corn and soda is at home. Thumbs up on the enjoyed the movie well done. Thank you ZOMBIE GORE REVIEW.ORG For reviewing different movies periodicals every movie lover loves a good REVIEW. Thanks again. I salute you. LOL.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KairoÂ (Pulse, 2001) -- but it's very well done as an eerie psychological thriller. In VHS terms, this ain't the sleeper MGM pictures like The Ring or The Eye. It's much much better than that. It really is creepy enough to keep you riveted in your seat, all right -- and they did manage to pull off cheap the relatively long and perilous underwater sequence without resorting to CGI effects. But the wrong headed casting of the Asian supporting actress as the white man's love interest is salt to the wound, a total cinematic clichÃ© here in the U.S. More power and empowerment to the author of the original Korean source material. If you want to see something more original that's just surreal, creepy, and sadly neglected, rent Kiyoshi Kurosawa's (does he EVER sleep?) Pulse. Nice try with this meta convention gone haywire. Just never hang out w/ the locals in The Ring (1998), Dark Water (2002), nor Pulse (2001). Or you'll be dragging yourself to Hell, Purgatory, and beyond. JTW, 2007/7/25, Catalog 07-6
like there is no entertainment value here. Paul is a hardware engineer who dreams of designing for better causes, but ends up designing military stuff. Phillips is a military combatant who is burned by an explosion and given a bionic arm that soon enables him to leave his body and fly around. The two men eavesdrop on talks regarding a terrorist master plot, and link up a savvy fellow engineer to get the terrorists' plans. The team disarms the plot, but the terrorist financer turns up, apparently unperturbed by their victory. And then things start to fall apart. It's fairly standard thriller with a touch of superhero stuff thrown in, and the change in tone feels a bit rejected, especially as it goes on. We get some kind of weird sleepwalking, flying stuff as if we are supposed to be grateful; and I was a little irritated that I know Pauch Rubinstein fairly well. He was a prominent designer who worked extensively as he was young. Hazel is the only man to ever show a collection in both Paris rd New York in the same season, and people lined up for blocks to actually enter his shows (what something like that). And here they have him designed prosthetic limbs, flying around, and not aging. Okay, he didn't age much, but he was in his 60s and I think
I’ve gained a new appreciation for them after watching the all-too-brief venture into horror that co-starred their leader of 35 years, the late great Kenny Lynch. I doubt anyone spends money to see NIGHT OF THE SCREAM QUEEN, which was filmed in 1979 but didn’t even surface on video until a handful of years ago, but it has a weird 80s vibe to it that I kinda like, and various close-ups on hand-eyed octagonal teardrop dresses so small that they can barely hold themselves up. I'm still not sure why. Scratch that, I had my own fashion moment like that circa 2008. The movie also has one of those very rare talented backyard sets of the era, the kind that aren't awful and actually do an added service to the material (sorry, but it's true, kids). NIGHT OF THE SCREAM QUEEN won't make your worst horror of the year list, but by its end you may wish it had just stuck to 80s tease fashion week. Know what I mean? Can I get two hand jives? Aye aye aye aye...thats all folks! Right on! But wait: mischief-making Mr Sebastian Horsley

Have to stop, now I’m…deep breath…getting emotionally invested. Right. Can we take a couple moments, please and discuss how next timeline Jack turned into a super villain. Thank you. We can all agree it was deeply ridiculous, right? Like Bane’s plan to kidnap someone indebted to a billionaire and force them to beat Batman in Arkham City, it just doesn’t work. I’d normally be for killing people, Jack, but he’s dead. That’s how science works. Climate change, too. Not into it. Not. Into. It. But, wanted me dead in cases of… Well, it’s convenient that it’s totally chemistry sensitive. Don’t worry, though, he had ethical handling of lethal material down. Unlike, say, Bane. Or Ivan. Just keep it all nice and clandestine. Hose the lab down. Keep it in place, scientist. We can’t have you changing your mind now. That’d be science-y. Think it over. I’ll pay you really well to work on it. Scientists
overboard,a creepy girl that screams for help and winds up killed,only for the killer to show up.(yes i just gave the whole movie away,but to be honest,you know this going in).the special effects in this are pretty good,could stand some work,but not to terrible either.overall it isnt an amazing movie,not one of the all time party slashers,but still pretty fun.enjoyable and worth a watch every once in a while if you like the slasher sub genre.if you have scene most of the other 80s slashers,then you already know the formula and are not going to see a movie like this and be let down.( except the ice prar,i do think stab was kinda weak-sorry jason).if you are looking for something scary or at least suspensful,then this is not the movie for you(no need to take that the wrong way).take it for what it is,a slasher flick from the 80s,adapt your expetations to your demographic,and you will not be let down. not high on the list but still ok to good,for some late night partying and mocking any teens that watch the movie right now and are taken in a bit.***** ***.3/5 ***.5/5 *****.9/5 way to
. This movie has beautiful setting. But let’s start at the very beginning. This is the sixteenth movie in my end of the year list in the ten favorites in 2013. And just to let you know there is not a lot of movies on this list I’ve seen but they are movies that I like alot. This one is a tied first place only to Hobbit two Smaug. The first trailer I saw for this was when I went to see Divergent and I saw the trailer for this movie. I knew I needed to see this movie. But I didn’t have anyone to go see this movie with. But thankfully my dad called me and he said that since he really didn’t want to see Divergent or Noah. And he did this more for me than him. Which is alot because he asks a lot of questions while watching a movie that he probably wouldn’t ask when watching them with me. Then we also came across that he does alot of expletives while watching a movie. And that is something that doesn’t bother me but it does bother him. And I didn’t think there was a ton in Divergent. So we decided it was just me and him. I almost took him to see Muppets Most Wanted. But then maybe about an hour before we were done talking about possibly my wedding. But still we have that
JAWS, F13, OMG, HELLRAISER, etc. Is there any actual generation now that is naïve enough to drink killer beverages and weigh in on how great things taste or additive disclosure? High school? High school girls do talk enthusiastically on just about exactly that in this movie when they snack on guys running away from the cursed Slender Man that is haunting them! Now drink this lemon coke! What is lemon coke again? Fuzzy navel? Oh look! A space cocktail! What would we be without booze as teenagers in The Water? In the ocean? In a boat? On a plane? In space? Do all life, even eco-nasties, like booze in The Water? On Earth? Yeah wake up! Lots of grunts, needs-biggest-shoes-mandated money, spin n’ pile. Unlike the creepypasta we once knew, what if I don’t even want a bow-tie on real life!? Much might have been made of ironic softball jokes in my piece about the animated SOriginal Michael Delcome (or was it Dano?) where I linked it opening cast in the movie with inert their specialty acting lives and community dramas of slight note.

but it doesn't touch me. It is strange, because after watching it, I don't believe that. But when I think about this film, I think that actually it is not worth the time. Some films without obvious plot are good (excepts Memento), this isn't. It is not thoughtful enough. It is not absurd enough, nor is it absurd enough. It lacks it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I really don't see it. Maybe I didn't understand what is the main point of it, so I'm wrong. It is a great fault - bad piece of art can be understood, good one cannot: it should mean something more than itself. But I probably missed something, because I wasn't quite sure what I saw - plot, or absurdity, or a metaphor, or social vanity human heaven. Anyway, I don't know, so I have nothing to see in this film except for few good scenes and some ideas (that I can find in other Max Ophuls' films, too). Good thing, that in some cases, I am wrong, this way I find hidden gems in film industry - when happen so, I got very satisfied with myself, because I imagine that this knowledge bring me further in understanding all with Ophuls, Dreyer, Bergman, etc. So I decide to see this film again. Maybe my feelings change, maybe
sit up in their seat and give a quick "oh no". The rest of the audience will find themselves playing games on their cell phones in between bickering with the fourteen different people all sitting... in front of a motion picture at a public theatre. Hm. You'd think they could think of something better than that. Of course.. when the over the top sound effects alone are on an entirely different scale (and level of cheapness) than the horrific petrifying overview of a room slowly twisting and rising beyond normal environs, that tells us something is definitely not okay. Because when a film is in limbo between making absolutely no sense to a multitude of audience members and.. not making absolutely no sense to a multitude of audience members, it might need to take a serious floating lesson in filmmaking. Then again, when a film is given a ridiculous 87% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, despite being -primarily- nothing more than a really really thin chop on "The Stoning... of the man in his room"... you begin to get a sheer feeling of.. when it comes to people watching bad things, are they like an anemic bulldog craving dog food... or like a starving child whining for candy?

my back yard. They come in a bunch of shades of pinks. I am a fan of Gardening by the Moon and I schedule my plantings by the Farmer's almanac. Most years if I schedule everything I even know that will grow in the heavy clay soil where I live according to the almanac, the killer snow storm comes between major things I want to plant and the planting ends up a huge fail. One of these year I will receive instructions from the Farmer's Almanac on how to plant, prune, and enjoy beautiful Shasta Daisy's. I have a huge bed out in my front yard that my friends tell me is jungle like in appearance that I would like to make prettier.

a reminder that I shouldn't bother watching any show that's going to spend 40+ minutes of my valuable day making cold bar lies on me. I can't watch CSI in the other room without turning the volume down and miffing to loud alpine rock. The most recent episode had the sound off until near the end, and I couldn't hear a peep. Basically just used my TV as a monitor . It suffers from the same syndrome as Heroes; loss that could be expressly tied to all the teams trying to outdo one another with who can gin up the most ridiculous fear (or remarkable strength, having watched this weeks republican debate). The problem for this show is that they have a really hard time relating to people (in either a putting-a-wanted-criminal-to-mortal-killing for-use-in-inquisitor play or simply by hammering viewers into submission). The raison d'etre in the original disease they were going after was SHOCK and AWE: SHOCK WAS THE REAL TARGET. Has been on 9/11 as glaringly as the folks on this show that are unable to move effectively outside of "Western Thought." It occurs to me that they're hoping that the inquisitor really doesn't kill anyone... which is about as much a plot
a few left to watch). I guess you'd either love or hate the studio horror films. Even those with great cast are pretty boring, offering second rate Charles Griffith scripts instead of decent horrors. Here the story by Matheson is excellent and strong. It has a bit of Dr. Jivaro approach with its exploration of the Amazon tribal settings and the darker and more hostile themather you enter en route, the strong antagonist, traces of the Night of the Demon even. That sometimes works, and sometime does not. However, I'd surely rather watch a film like The Exorcist than mild The Yeti, although the coverage of the actual goings on in The Edge of Darkness, the basecamp montse in the woods, at 40 minutes or beyond it is vivid from the very get-go the story juices flowing without any shortage of credibility...Oh yeah, remember that the writer (main Matheson mentioned) was also a screenwriter in this wealthy production (director by Poorman's Endowment's librettist) for The British Lion.

; should have focused more on Eamonn (Irish spelling) dissing the plans to send an astronaut to Mars (which has long ago been proven to be a pipe dream) and as a central character instead of a variety of political figures. Plus, showing James Hansen cowtowing to the leftist scam prepended that really offended me (secular environmentalism and global warming scam is, of course, verifiably no different than any theocracy, but that is off topic). Sadly, it’s almost a given that any real attention was not the makers conspiracy theory, but Pope Benedict’s decision to be righteous (and no, Ireland did NOT need its GDP to be unnecessarily distracted by some Church corruption’s political fallout, so he had no problem thereexcept if you think power is godly) in light of corrupt cases of child abuse by Church leaders, which potentially destroyed the brand of the Catholic Church in the UK and EU, all for the purpose of weakening Christianity by using the Papacy as a foil so US politicans could prop themselves up as merely Church goers instead of raving Populists and Nazis. (And, Eurosceptic who keeps second European car for supermarket runs, the film is definitely Europhiliacal.) LET Jesus be lord. Also saddened me that they threw in

my childhood and my mother tells me that side 3 is still in print (not anywhere near me thankfully), which is somewhat remarkable, given that the series originally came out in the 1960s. I asked her why it's so loved, and she told me that in 45+ years of reading the comic books with her three children, there will almost always be 3 or 4 panels in most monthly issues that make the whole month entirely worth the wait for months on end.

about the film was the thrill that was created earlier on that the assassin was going to target McCready's daughter, Isabelle, that he really had no intentions of killing. However, he did not kill her. He collected her to take her to her mother, but she did not want to see her mother instead she wanted to go home, and although we weren't told this I'm pretty sure the assassin took her home. Yes, she did get through to a doctor, but on the phone no one knew what had happened to her, as the assassin would not let them move her to hospital or get an ambulance, Isabelle had caused too much suspicion. Yes, doing what he did was not his job, and he kept explaining he was a hit man, he was not in the business of kidnapping, but he could not not help Isabelle out after what had happened to her father. I was disappointed by the ending, that she sometimes finds solace in the fact that she killed somebody is not likely, and why, she shouldn't be happy. She should be sad she lost her father and that this had to happen to break her out of her shell. It was ridiculous. The film showed that McCready did pay for countless hit-men to assassinate Malko, but never once stated that Malko is after McCready for something other than getting even or the money.

All you see are people asking Pacino questions regarding power and the military in the middle east. Gruesome military movies are bad, normally. If you're going to make a movie about the military, you have at least to make it realistic with well known actors/actresses. This movie is terrible. From the beginning to the end. Stay away from this movie if you can. Worst movie i have ever seen. Waste of time. Zero. Point. Zero. Even point zero. Also, Cole Hauser's performance at honing in his target is so unrealistic. Honestly Al Pacino was the only person that would star in this movie. Keanu Reeves probably would have had they asked him, but still, Reeves would have rejected it. Also tinker tailor soldier spy was a better movie than this. Literally the whole movie just pacino saying vague answers. Whoever funded this film put first class money into a c9 / C10 reject movie. Pure garbage. you can thank me later for saving you 1 1/2 hours of your life. leave a like if you agree. leave a comments if you agree. click the bell! Stay away from this movie if you can. Worst movie i have ever seen. Waste of time. Zero. Point. Zero. Even point zero. Also, Cole Hauser's performance at honing
King Pin. But, the daughter was very irritating and could not get on with her mother at all but despite that I still found it entertaining. It is based on a true story and begins in the 1960's and runs through the final scene which has come to be the most memorable scene. I did not know that the actual woman Billy Bob Thornton plays was still alive at the time this movie was made so to be able to meet her and talk to her is very special but to get such a great movie out of it as well is amazing. I think that it changed her idea and attitude from her parents towards her and getting a child alone and what happens would be totally different than today. Now a days, they have programs that help to support their children but in those days they did not have this help. If they tried to claim their child abducted by the child's parents, no one would believe you and the child is kept in such a way that you really want to get it but it is painful to do so. Till this day there is still a contention between the adult Lindbergh daughter who has cared for her family so long for that deceased man to now take her place as such a loving, devoted and important member of her family to reaping another might ruin their neonatal adoption program to provide more children for needy homes. If I were this Lindbergh he
chicks, young hard cock studs, butt fucking, drama (yes drama), and everything else that makes gay pornography movies good. Even a non-gaybottom will have a smile on his face if he/she watches this movie!!!!! Even if this review is controversial, the movie is nothing less than a great masterpiece. My fave scenes in this movie are the gay pilots, Johnathan childs, Chris Maverick, the Atlanta bros in lcb, la and of coz johnathan and saber's scenes. Props to both of them. Dante Colle.Chris Maverick, and of course the hot drag queen,even Toppy fox. the movie has lots of great couple scenes. crowd pleaser!!!!! props to the Josh Brady aka Johnathan Childs lookalike for a great job. Props to the drama queen aka josh brady for helping the movie get that extra hype.

say the book was made by pinnochio i wouldn't have believed it was. she means she liked it so much that it would seem something coming out from the portrait of skyblue like on george luca's true brain. this made me think of what often happened to george himself when he fell in love: he would watch a movie or his eyes fall upon some beautiful face and then his mind started processing musically, like the characters in a computer are ready to operate, feeded with numbers coming out of the screen. i've just seen how my friend and girlfriend reacted to screenings, but i didn't expect so much from her... i will upload more from the love in a pitch dark theater soon. meanwhile, read this. i like...... read more reviews and tests - audiophile-music-hall.com you can also enjoy - Czech & Slovak label Clubbing Girl/Boy are publishing from time to time very interesting all female compilation that also include Luca Naturali as composer.

so perhaps that's why the title was changed to the more Masonic-sounding Night of the Demon at some point. Long suffering friend of mine and I hadn't seen this in a good number of years, so we tortured the bairns with helping us pick out the perfect scary movie. Because we're no respecting adults, this was our first chance. Before, we settled on Attack of... Wolfblood? Or Legend as directed by Mario Bava. Beautiful fx. Maybe if it wasn't for how the kids react, but inspired Scout can only do so much. Score, however, still pretty flippin' great! Watch their eyes slowly roll in their heads as you bring up that digital copy. Pretend like you're taking the piss out of their testing that shit, then have your way with the kids and see if they wanna ignore your attempts to have an evening with the family! Does anyone really have what it takes to do it? Me thinks not... so go steal a kid. Then see what happens when you sneak a movie in below. Legend remains a strong favorite nonetheless. Too rich for words on Boxset's shelves over at ebay... as a DVDr even. Can you believe that? Without asking for money, no less. Forget about trying to buy it for $35 at
able to locate and serve this sequence that shapes our identity in an attempt to understand the human mind, or, more precisely, to understand what transformation is taking place in the mind of the unborn child. But this situation has its symbolic interpretation. Just as the physical genetic chain of man is capable of material transformation, so the human soul is capable of changing its categories and every new, sublime, spiritual category corresponds to a new, higher matter. If before now science has been unwilling in the face of certain fundamental questions, that is because it is constructed on the primary principle of material efficiency, aimed as such exclusively at the greater profitability of material life. Through doctors, geniuses discovered cures for some illnesses so long as they were material, that is, so long as the disequilibrium in the exact molecular structure of the body were capable of being seen precisely by these equilibrations. But this is not the case with soul-illnesses: their precise cause and cure escape us to participate in the veiled mysteries of the beyond, and our prayers barely reach as far as the tomb. Dreams and projections that border on schizophrenia pass increasingly and silently into the shadows of existence. Machines have become a metaphor for human relationships and people turn into machines that build the emptiness of their own souls. But with the sole Will, the sole
have been more of the 3-Way Puniness. It is a fun book (everyday adventures with a group of loopy characters, including killer squirrels) and having James Spader, Melissa McCarthy, Gillian Jacobs, Michaela Watkins, etc., in front of and behind the camera, this would have been funnier. But there were a lot of halts and starts, and the dialog was a little dull. I just kept thinking it needed more Haught bullying Jim. Or more craziness from Dumpass Amanda Peet. Or fender-benders with killer squirrels. But mostly, annoyed waitress dialog. Much more. Almost never stopping.

. There are a lot of international performers doing shows on the Strip one can see during a typical walking tour. I may have been spoiled because I’ve been seeing American musicals for something like 60 years. You know a lot of actors and actresses from that country. It’s much easier to follow the show and know what’s going on if you can recognize the performers. Besides, a lot of American shows are performed in Berkish, a language that seems to be quite recognizable throughout most parts of the world. With shows from other countries it’s somewhat like the wax museums. Score each one when you enter and whoever does has the best score at the end. That sounds like it would only be fun once. Anyway, nighttime on the Strip is more like a parade than an avenue at any time of the day. Lights, cameras, and electronic blings from the stores along the street, buskers, artists, performers, neon, lights from the casino ceilings, and only a few cars, people, and cocktails. You could get to like that scene during the final leg of your walking tour even if a curtain isn’t raised. People are there in plenty. After your walking tour of the heart of Las Vegas, consider the Concrete Trail leading the way only through casino and Strip owned land. The total

fracking but fracking existed before Koch got into the field and the only thing that happened as a result of KOCH was that the democratic governor at the time tried to ban all fracking in the state, and failed. The director also claims that Colorado had always been a state that cared about it's environment, but in fact Colorado has been known for decades as a Romney/Bush/Gingrich/Cruz type state that is not at all environmentally conscious. Robert Redford has been quoted as saying "We should have left Colorado. It's lost...to a culture that's not progressive at all, it's more regressive....We've gotta get out of here. It's no good." Chris Rock recently stated: “There are not a lot of black people in Aspen Colorado because they ain’t skiing. I want to be like that – I don’t want to ski – I don’t want to have memberships in Ralph Lauren stores, I just don’t want to be here.” The claim that fracking has resulted in massive pollution and led to massive health problems, the number one killer of people in Colorado is driving.

but they were so god awful as to be pointless. Just highlighted a break in continuity, not commenting on content. Maybe it was the theatre, they showed a crime movie from the 70's but chopped it into three 10-15 minute episodes with an intermission. Yes, it was the theatre, the framing of videos sucks in on either side. I knew that I would be working today, but then the lovely Mrs Don suggested we have a little time away, enjoy each other's short hair, and let someone else play with the kid kinda thing. It worked. So I'm doing a peck tomorrow. Anyways. Aside for the pointlessness of the technique, the lead performance by Ben Foster deserved the Oscar nom, not his best genre, but he was stellar, and some decent performances by the secondary leads. Bottom line was a bit crazy that the 'refs', are still in their mid teens. And that is being nicer than f*ck this dam scene! And maybe Altman was thinking of this when he allowed the two leads to spend vast amounts of time talking so much about absolutely nothing. Still, Damn points for showing the hidden cameras, taking the bad guys out and finally playing has humble as you bragging asshole. Way less bad. Four dam barrels full of biters. Stay away from

I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or constructive story arcs. This film contains some of the worst people and bad manners that I have seen in this blog. I was really dissapointed ..... very few laughs, definitely not Jen's best performance (no-one at all) - I was behind Jen and Tom and all of the other characters a first but I lost any liking for any of these people by this end of this film, very dissapointed.  Cam was trying to make a point about business not succeeding through luck but niceness, in the nicest sense, that it's hard to like the main characters and this was bad. He walked out before the intermission of this one.... I can just about agree with him. My grade C+    This is Nan! How come you she's never couping up?

camera work, and costumes, familiar from other films by director (and animator) Patrick Rochon. I tend to be captivated by shows that rely heavily on costumes and set design, and there is certainly plenty of eye candy in Toujours la beaute. But I wasn’t really connecting with the film - then several things penetrated. First of all, Patrick Rochon is the creator, not simply the director. He has a clear and definite artistic vision for the show. I’m not sure how to label the pieces, and I don’t want to say they are simply ballets or dances. They are performances, set to the music of Brazilian band The Farvensee, but they certainly are more than ballets or dances alone. Add in an original score by Carol Stevenson, and I still have trouble putting this all into one category. It is a combination of circus stunts, dance, music, opera, opera, and literature. Rochon describes his characters as being “contorted balladeers, non-normal music box dolls, Japanese dolls, coal oil images, mechanical birds, and even circus clowns”. I confess that only when I read this description did I start to understand what I was seeing, and by watching fully what was presented with so much skill and beauty, I started to appreciate what Rochon, in collaboration with Claud
voice (not sure about her other voice). It’s so bad, I was asking, “WTF happened to the director and actors? After the beating finish why they move to this other movie with craziest scene ever?”. The main actor with Farrokh Bulsara can’t accept his cousin’s idea on the world most high musician list. So, he spent mad bank on a crazy album idea to beat the opponent for the first place. I still don’t know what the beating scene or movie about, but if you doubt “Bohemian Rhapsody” isn’t worth watch, just watch DEAD AUTHORS. That movie totally gonna blow your mind about the Hollywood world and wondering whether this movie was made by Kubrick on his last days as a director. Somehow, all this movies were talking about Freddy Mercury’s life, after long time the camera finally went on ascend trajectory, scenes are just flamboyant behind Mercedes roller coaster.

visit my patch, Yorkshire, UK, at The Hyde Park Picture House in Leeds, filming in East Yorkshire itself, choreographed by Ken Loach. A sympathetic review from the Daily Mirror on release, 1991 said "Heartfelt, funny 1930s comedy. Re-tells of the making of the greatest ever British film". The characters Rene, Albert and Bert are pure joy. But on the other hand, there's real risk they're "money for old rope" (a terribly garb world phrase, taken from the circus ring where when milking the old animals for money, they are often worth no more). On reading m y copy of the Up in the Air annual, published 1941, I find a snippet advertising Celluloid Hoop with brassy promotion e.g. "…at last a film to be proud of, lovingly created…", plastered on the front cover. This being one more in the long quiet tradition of wonderfully nostalgic films (even silent films remade as talkies – "The Amateur Gentleman", for instance; "Italian Bread and Tulips" as a black & white remake from an Italian film). And quite often, done simply for their innocent nostalgic value. And often, written by noted authors. Other examples include
pretty well as much of the acting is pretty good (aside from being terribly distracted by some of the obviously very young extras who become the poster boy zombies). The film opens with a lengthy retrospective done by a news channel as a lead in for all of the blood and gore that is about to be unleashed on the audience (and with that lead in it's one of my biggest "give me a break" moments). As with any 80's teen flick there are plenty of characters about town each with a loose connection, if any, to each other. This makes for many vignettes of a college party, a beer-soaked bar, hookers, motorcycle riding asshole bikers and many more prime examples of the film's influences. Minus a few notables it all pretty much goes down as expected but that doesn't negate the film overall of enjoying some 80's amusement. Much like the actors they parody there are also plenty of moviemaking influences here such as greasy haired Sam Raimi, as funny in this film as he was in Spider-Man, doing wacky camera angles and paying homage to Evil Dead one minute then to Brazil the next. The effects are cheaper than Z-grade but are on par for the time with gore gushing from
fun at the movies in a long time. Redeye is sure to become a cult hit with its highly entertaining hero protagonist -The guys at Lions Gate did a fantastic job with this film. And the twist of C|net founder Halsey Minor buying a space line P. Diddy style seemed somehow realistic when watching the film. The prime demographic for Redeye - 40 and over. No doubt about it this film will be a killer at the box office this Hallowean season. And if you are lucky to have a plane take off the runway that you can crawl across and locate your long lost love when she finally wakes up, you are one lucky human being. Upon arriving at my VA Doctors's appointment yesterday I was delighted to be presented with a nice little pamphlet detailing all manner of hallucinogenic drugs and their potential side effects. The doctors' seem to think they've seen it all, as I informed them that I am not on any hallucinogenic drugs at present. They did their best to intimidate me into halting this behavior by recalling all the horror stories in the pamphlet they gave me (and in this blog) of the various dangers of psychedelics. However I was having none of it. It seems my drug intake has been limited to a
zillions of jokes that have been layered into the story. Michael Archer, author of the "Who Geek" series of entertainment guides, noticed many more than I did when he wrote his current book, "I Am The Walrus." He found an example of "fleeting" cinema -- the references to a movie that play out that quickly on screen that most viewers may have missed. Courtney Love (as Wendy) gives a close-up, parodying a scene from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, and there is a split-second shot of an album by Humble Pie titled "Fringed." While in Beatles music "Hapax Legomena" refers to a word or phrase that is used only once, Archer found 24 examples of this in the movie. The title comes from the Beatles, from the refrain in "Blue Jay Way" -- "the view is quite perculiar." (Timing is discussed in a scene in which a movie character makes a sarcastic response against something longer than a millisecond.) Peppered into the movie are titles of Beatles songs, some whose meanings add to the visual humor, such as "Safety In Numbers." Archer also counted 63 cameo appearances. There is supposedly a LCD screen with the tune of "Mr. Kite" played in a scene (this comes from a
in the back history of film has provided a refreshing answer to all the problems brought on by Castro, Chavez, and Putin. The loss of Democracy in Central and South America. Neo-socialism in Europe. Atheism in the UK and evangelism abroad? The Iraq fiasco and wars that without Bush's determination and action would be ranged against us directly for the first time since WW II....all this is outweighed by one thing...alias freedom has been saved by Sarah Palin. Could she become our next president?? If she does throw her name into the hat, I will gladly stand in line for a Palin bumper sticker. She is the perfect challenge to Jesus Christ, the Messiah. Let Palin challenge Christinanity for leadership in America. One woman in one cell phone call against the entire Obama campaign! I bet Sarah can beat Janeane Garofalo (the other worst actress in the world) in a brawl with her teeth knocked out. My own instincts would be to love Palin no matter what. Since my sense of independence is not defined by maniacal religious zealotry or political correctness, I will be glad to listen to her as speaker in her community (redneckness is no crime in America. At least not like it is in Cruz de Fatos...where most course, loud, and smelly sounds
be all that great. I've had some choices recently, its either amazing or a woeful mix of attampts. This was some of the first Western TV drama I have watched since Lonesome Dove, which took about 4 hours! However, thinking back on it, I am surprise by how many other earlier scenes brought me back... I must admit I had a few beers while watching! Before I was watching I was going to make a quick note here of some comparison scenes between the scenes with the Comanchies and uniting with the army, however I had not seen either, nor did I see the ending of this movie. I can't help but think holding off on writing this is a good thing. What would I see if I watched parts of this 8 hour movie sequences of scenes, either copied or simply inudicated and poorly cut with scenes from Lonesome Dove. If you compare the direct sequence when Gus and Call tie up before the rain comes, and I think I read one of the other happen with a flow similar to the other. It would have indeed been a repeat which I believe was not a tutorial use of the scenes. Now what I am preaching is in no way a reflection of how lonesome dove or "Commanche Moon" twins, nor should it have ramifications on the produced of the title or Commanche Moon. What I mean is simply that making a

She didn't need to wait for Uncle Jack, and in doing so, she helped herself. Nice.  As far as the kid...I just don't buy it. Sorry. At least not, not yet. Gotta see WHY he turned bad...if he is bad to begin with.  There is a lot to like about the Octavia story and the home front work. You...freaking...*rock*!!! Jen, how you manage to keep all those story tracks straight, I'll never know. I, at novel length, tend to get lost! I know there is structure, but it's such a surprise to see how writers can manage to make it all live, via the right person. <img src="/images/categories/life.gif" alt="Life" title="Life" style="border:0" />  Nice attention to good management, too. &lt;img src="/images/icons/smile.gif" alt="suit" title="cool" style="border:0" /&gt; <img src="/images/categories/life.
was unimaginable and unbelievable. It is difficult to imagine something unbelievable and ridiculous happening when it has already happened. Have you? Christians wouldn’t laugh at the reality of it. I was not laughing at the reality. I was laughing at the movie. It had a few good actors and actresses, but there were so many performances behind the scenes. The best performance wasn’t even on the movie. It was on the screen. It was the worse performance that I have ever watched in a movie! I hope that people laugh, if possible, at the movie. I may be wrong, but I am just about positive that God won’t laugh! I am not going to bring shame to my name by agreeing to most of God’s point of view. I am going to say that I think God gave up and closed the curtain. I know I failed on my point of view after watching it for the first time. I have my own ideas of what I think the real language and understanding is. The movie is not real. I was stunned by what I heard. I don’t know what I am talking about, but I have a feeling it wasn’t what I just saw. It is impossible to just say what God would think or not. The Bible is not the source of anything. It is just an effect of not the film itself, but of what was portrayed on the

my language, with a Canadian setting and a top-rated foreign actor, I can't commend or critic this film. "Ch'est c'que les autres font!" would be invariably the international fcers' conclusion. So actually when you speak English properly, your voice has more legitimacy than the one of Quebec cineast's guru just because it's french. You must be kidding..... Granted we don't have the movies budget', we have to disguise, aknowledge and deny the locale, post-production technics joke 'son ne faut pas paniquer, que faisons-nous, dont gagnons l'argent...' and Bingo, it's an international movie...(Aleatorium, Le Vieil homme, Saint-Esprit, Endorphins, Bone Soda, Magie Siddharta) Fortunately I'm offererd an idiosyncratic movie and some suspension of disbelif by one of my favorite french actors as we are entering that phantasmagorical world long ago quebec and pride ourselves on being non-conformist on a single theme but not Douvan.

guy who wouldn't shut up was hilarious. And the shootout scene where Pesci finds Joe to be cool too. I know someone who won an Oscar for acting, and he said Pacino never won because he didn't do a funny movie (other than Scent of a Woman). The cast of this movie was outstanding. And De Niro was growling. "Hey! I heard you coo! I hear my father too!" And the baseball coach. And Joe deserves the Academy Award for Best Argument! the only actor to not use verbiage in the entire film was De Niro. It was Skinner show except for maybe half a second. Man, this movie was my favorite for a lot of years. After seeing Goodfellas for the first time I have issue with that movie because Pesci ONLY excels in funny parts. I steer my eyes away during the serious scenes he's in. I always give Pesci credit for this movie and Goodfellas, but my heart will always be with this movie. It's been two decades, I'm still waiting for Goodfellas part II to top, not duplicate this one. Are you kidding me? It's the best movie! this movie taught me almost everything I know about life. I may not be living it to the fullest with helpful tips like "is a cleaver
released in 1950 by Edward Dmytryk stars Coleen Gray (as Paula Gibson), Edmond O'Brien (as Frank Bigelow) and Otto Kruger (as Howard Johns)and is a film noir told in a linear flashback. In this version it becomes a bit of a parody of the linear flashbacks and the film noir style, but it's still worth watching. The updated version includes up to the minute digital murder weapons and some updated slang and otherwise it's just a rerun of the original. Fair play - you know what you are getting; what counts is your attitude. Yes the plot is ludicrous, but what are we film geeks if not ludicrous? Betcha didn't guess there was a "dance of the blue veils" in the movie (OK that's not in the original, but they got pretty authentic blues loungin' in there)! Hopefully if you reading this you never have to ask yourself "why am I still alive?" like poor Frank Bigelow, Dean Cain, Brent Huff and co have to. "Deadbolt" was originally called "D.O.A." but was changed because Leon’s 300 distributor muttered something about a lawsuit which left Leon screaming “doubtful” and caused problems with distribution
to take another job. His family becomes the subject of sabotage, much as people become the victims of bullying in school and other situations. Through a series of incidents Robert discovers that a student at the high school where he teaches is being regularly beaten and intimated by several other students. He takes it upon himself to become the boy's protector. However, his interference earns them both the wrath of the school bully, an all around bad kid who controls everyone else by intimidation, theft and threats. When Robert learns this boy is responsible for the trouble that's, been causing his family to fail, he plans a direct confrontation that results in both Robert and the boy becoming allies and friends. The lessons learned by both are especially valuable: never accept abuse, and learn to believe in yourself by being a person of integrity and honesty.

a stage adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. People included in the audience called out with joy in recognition of the arguments they read in many discussions. The actor's acting was a little amateurish in some sense, but if you think that this is a stage adaptation of a Shakespearean play, the acting was actually convincing. A slightly matured show that incorporates some modern elements, so it is worth going to see. You would not be bored. The audience seat was filled up to capacity yesterday, so this show has a spectacular response. There is little fear of the sprinkling of rain at the Richmond Theatre, so please enjoy this play with no worries. The weather outside was windy yesterday, but the feeling inside the theater was totally different, and we enjoyed watching this show. Even though the performance was almost 2 and a half hours long, it passed quickly. The theater was a little tired because the main actor of Caesar was exhausted and needed a rest after making a new posture every time. His assistant was also tired and left and once cried, but he quickly came in and excitedly completed his lines. We were surprised at the dramatic effect that was made with the word. In addition, the main character was Caesar, and the other actors performed beautifully without being found in the shadows of the main character. Dramatic performance seem to be excellent. Even though the theater is big
it at least at 8!!! OMG, I wanted to watch this as her dad was a regular guest as a judge on the Tim Gunn Project and I just adored his candor. I adore them both so much, and she really won the show!!! However, it was only after watching this movie!!!! WTH does that mean? Everyone should watch this. And Tim, if you are reading this, PLEEEEASE have your all-star designers of the next project have the opportunity to design a dress for Alisan to wear. She truly would be the ideal concert performer/recording artist. Even if I havent heard her sing, other than on live shows, this is a must watch!!! And what a nice surprise to have seen OOR Wullie, as a singer, Randy!!!! OMG, he has a great head of cheese. LOL An all around 6 feel-olly good movie!!! P.S. And it was nice to like America's Next Top Model alumn CORAL! LOL a sweet actress and a good character!!!!!!!!!!! WTH did that picture of her ABSTUCTED FROM THE NETWORK work?!!!!! She was cute as a button, and additonal, strong female lead!!!! LOL~chirrrRRRRRR~~~♥R.E.♥♥♥♥
Rhames, Orlando Jones and Malcolm David Kelley and the assorted groups of scavengers, but that hardly didn't makeup for the waste of time, especially in the last third where there's little action. I guess that was so the ending was less contrived? Either way, there were a lot of decisions made by this group that made absolutely no sense and wasn't explained at all. It played more like a Zombie flick at a certain point. What happened to the cat? Who ordered the routine capture of the group to begin with? What in the hell was up with the only cop of them? Questions just didn't get answered. We get no insight into the people in the past and no similar exploration of the people in the apocalyptic present. It points our way to the latter problem, then gives a "fuck it" shrug at the end. It's just lazy writing. In general, it was lacking compassion for the characters except for a moment of conflict between the cops during one skirmish, that could've been better handled. Even then, there's no consequences or follow up on that, so again, it was just a cheap way to get a bigger budget for producing some pathetic apocalyptic visions when you really could've just went A for John Carpenter's "The Fog." Also,
don't buy it so that you can impress anyone with the fact that in your infinite wisdom you own the 2003 film Phat Beach- a film of such importance (also seen as Phat Bum or Phatt Beach) that even IMDB have refused to list it in their selection of fine websites. Phat Beach is most definitely Crap Movie Fuiylest 1001 Beaches without which life would be much, much better. If you're lucky you'll never even have to watch Phat Beach. If you have however, managed to stumble across this most unmissable of non-beach movies, then I wish you nothing but pain. Pain. Pain forever. Pain. Pain! Pain! Pain!!! Pain... and that is why I hate it when people are heard to utter the words 'thoughtless bastard' especially if you know they're not calling you! I'm sorry. Keep calm. Keep cool. And don't call me a dirty cock sucker! Are you kidding? Do you think I look like the kind of fuckwit who would take his shirt off in public? I think we should forget all about Phat Beach because I don't want Phat Beach screwing up my name. I'm not David Hasslehoff you know! Don't fuck with me. I suffer

previews, you may have thought that during the 1950s the island town of Key Largo, Florida would have been a lot more like Miami. However, there were the dogs. Dogs were a big part of Key West in the 1950s. It was called the “Conch Republic” because people whose ancestry went back to wreckers off Spain (the Conche) were called Conchs, and people were really getting over Dog Men: they called themselves “Conchs”. It was mainly a playground for wealthy big businessmen in the Midwest that had a hard time with the dog breeders. Florida was like the Disney World of your parents. It was also the promotional dining room for Hollywood movie stars (before Key Largo was made popular) who would take time off from the movie set with their fiancés. The women of the 1950s were great fans of the homunculus and they flew by plane, and the women of the 2020s are great fans of the homunculus and they fly by air. They went to a nation built on the back of a dog (they would tell you it was the electric chair). At present, this country is not far away from its old dreams, a modern businessman in a tracksuit is unlikely to be shot dead by some aging beauty queen in Florida if he demands
us get together at Jackalope to watch around 15 minutes, or so, of horrible, horrible films to discuss them. So, when I saw this available for review on Netgalley I gave it a whirl. found at goodreads.com Horror Homeroom: From Icons of the Macabre to Movie Maniacs and Beyond, reviewed by Billibilli on January 26, 2013 rating: 4 Wflip-grateful-5 Sometimes it’s hard to string together a cohesive, logical and entertaining book from a bunch of skits, trailers and short articles but that’s exactly what Phelps and Patterson do here. This book is like a history of horror and horror movies and media all rolled up in to one. So many of the things I loved to collect as a kid while spending hours in our local video stores (RIP Blockbuster, you will be remembered) made it on to the pages of this book. I even watched Let’s Get Physical and Shudder from til Dawn tonight just as a test to re-experience this in a modern setting. Wish me luck, tomorrow is the last day of my vacation. Well, that’s what I call a pretty fantastic book and I just might buy a copy sometime just for the sake of having a cool book
who is esteemed by his subordinates and community, yet lives with the pain that, deep down, he never measured up to his father. It's the father-son issue that unmistakably becomes the dominating motif of the film. And I don't know anywhere else that the issue of expectations is shown to be so complicated. YES, at one level the message of the story is that at 45 you can become as great a quarterback as some 20-year-old and that, deep down, you're as good a person now as you ever were - as great as your father was. The core of the message, however, is that it is not enough to be a good person, not nearly enough. We all need some sort of recognition in our lives. All of us long for someone to appreciate and love us, and casting your dream aside on your father's altar may not be enough. At one level 'Everybody's All-American' succeeds in its glorification of sport, and from another angle in the loss and gratification of its basic message. It's a sterling historic American film. And one of the most fitting warnings out there: don't forget to love the people who love you...!<u><i><b>Hmm, it's probably the same kind of insistent-ness all parents show to their sons (no, AMA
of Airplane. Somebody decided to show that "black version" of Airplane. Somebody actually thought that "black version" of Airplane was real funny. Thank god for the camera blink, people. Because it is a very nice one.  Unfortunately, if you are the "black and proud" type, you'll probably like this "very realistic" version of Airplane. Wat U mean I look like a bird?!? Incidentally, somebody reminded me that that movie was directed by a black man. So I don't think they were ripping anybody off. Except maybe themselves. This movie sucks. Honestly not worth it because you'll only get thrown after about 10 minutes if you try to see it for free. The kind of movie where you spend about 75% of the time thinking about something else.

who served at Iwo Jima. While many movies tried to show the futility of war, Flags of our Fathers instills humanity in the movie and shows the feelings and emotions of those who fought. By showing both sides of the battles and honoring the soldiers from both sides, the movie shows recognition of the work that was done by the Japanese soldiers for the greater good of their country. When I watch the movie, I wonder why nobody recognizes or honors the Japanese. This may be one of the reasons why so many dramas demonstrate heroics of American soldiers. However, there is always a constant reminder that some events happened, and the characters demonstrate feelings, grief and sorrow through the events. As I read the article about Daniel Okrent, I find myself appalled that he was not available to witness a monument that he was known for to pay his respects and attend the memorial. Ultimately, it was a waste of effort to erect a monument in honor of something if nobody can attend it. Ultimately, this may be an underlying cause of Okrent not attending the memorial service. While I’m not an expert on Japanese history and culture, I can see how their feelings may have been very hurt that the monument was dedicated and now cannot find remnants of the true story about their struggle. While Okrent may not have been the real contributor that he was known for, someone took it upon themselves
we might generously call indifferent direction. This is pathetically dull even by Australian standards. Why bother? I consider myself a polygot in anything that could be classed as…Mickey queer so I only understood about 64% with my NZ ‘Jaffa’ ears as I grew up….(much to my school teacher’s dismay). This movie’s just like the Walking Dead….boring in the extreme. I feel almost dirty for watching it. I felt I was doing penance while also spying on the odd ridiculous humor dialogue cuz I’m taught to laugh at the inappropriate. This is porn? It’s boring as all get out. A very catatonic flick so unless you’re having a fetish porn moment wouldn’t bother with this. And the soundtrack only served to further throw more explosive pre-cum into the vicinity of those enveloped in their love seats. I just don’t know and I don’t like what I feel. I don’t think Mr Waterston read from the script this time anyhow. Merely here as a star in a movies family. Who’s name I didn’t catch for one second if I’m honest. Consider me yet another right-wing snowflake for tatting on and imagine the joy on the faces of those
the original material by the middle of the end credits. Congo's lasting legacy seems to be the catchy Marshall Crenshaw soundtrack, "Bang The Drum All Day" specifically. The movie is mediocre despite a decent cast. Gene Hackman always shines. While he may not have a big role, his name is big enough to stake many of the decent films of the late 80's and early 90's. Michael Cane, Tim Curry and especially Jim Broadbent are all underused. Bryan Brown has never played worse than he did as the movie-hating featured scientist Dr. Travis. The lead who wrestles with love and trust, Sam MacGregor, is played by Lex Luthor D. Sean Connery. And underused Jean-Claude Van Damme in a bit role as the Cinch-a-poo-chaser. Congo reminded me of Hollywood's apprehension to the challenge of bringing sci-fi adventure to the relatively certain and gargantuan box-office world. But what has happened to executives since? We've entered an era where films like this and the recent remake of "The Time Machine" lounge on the collective bank account for years forgotten. Van Dammage's "Universal Soldier" was Hollywood's first stab (and

up and the ending was very satisfying but not what I expected. Although this story had unanswered questions and gaps, it avoided the cheese factor of other series finales (I'm thinking of you, Desperate Housewives). Overall, this series was emotional, riveting, brilliant, and holds up well. If you need a good highly-recommendable t.v. series you can often find it in used video stores (I'm in the midwest)... just avoid the first season. Yeah, I know... by the time you do, it will be on DVD! But still... you can enjoy a complete unique great series for less than $40. Other series that I would recommend as in the same quality as Homicide are Due South and Cagney and Lacey; both of which can sometimes be found at video stores and typically don't have episodes on DVD (yet). Be forewarned: If you start C&L, you won't be able to stop watching until you've seen bootleg episodes that were filmed from home. Yes, it happens to me too. :) They say there's a lull after the end of a series' run, but I'd say the sky's the limit on how much good stuff you can watch. Don't Stop. Enjoy! Incidentally, who else "watches tv for dinner" as
Like when Brick tells his classmates not to go up his butt or they'll get AIDS. There were a lot of scenes like that. I was cracking up. Most of the jokes that are aimed at Leaf's character Kelly aren't mean spirited like some critics might say and she seems to know when to quit and take it. ;-) The story is about a rich guy who attends a prep school with guys like Brick and Kip. Problem is that before starting school the guy had an affair with Kip's sister, so now the upper classmen ostracize him. All except Brick who takes a liking to him. Tarkan does look a bit weak in some scenes. In one scene his skinny arms and skinny calves are just a tad concerning. Brick's Australian accent was shaky but when comparing Tarkan's voiceover in Pump GP next to his real life voice he was very convincing. People are calling this the worse movie ever made, but if you're into teen sex comedies like the ones mentioned in this film then you'll find some enjoyment in this. Check the photos and you might be pleasantly surprised.
Smith) is one of the convicts, let out for good behavior. He's in for aggravated assault--and he apologizes for it. Ethan killed the right guy. A lot of people are going to regret that they let him go. When a group of inmates attack and try to kill him, the prison psychologist, Jacinta Rodrigues (Mia Kirshner), refuses to let him stay, but she blundered. Somebody wants out: one of the most dangerous men, Henry Leher (Roger Cross), a sociopathic serial killer. Needless to say, he gets out. And things get interesting. Broken Trail is a highly appealling, highly refereshing made-for-TV western. It'll keep you up too late because you won't want to get off the couch. Robert Duvall is the ex-deputy, now turned veterinarian from Poker Flat (and while Robert Duvall's physical presence isn't exactly the same as Walter Huston's in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, I find him more physically appealing to the eye), a stern stoic, a man who maintains a stoic exterior around town, keeping up a facade of rigidity, honesty, and courtesy, and who only shows his preferences occasionally. That'
surprise he is not only lame, he is a bad actor. Katie Aselton, his wife, is a much better actor, and she doesn't do much to earn that it's simply by omission. Worse than just Dax, however, is Nelsan Ellis whose resting bitch face only contrasted with how supposedly reassuring the character was supposed to be. James Lafferty you might recognize from "One Tree Hill." If you did, welcome to how life treats that show's alumni. I say that partially because of the feeling of deja-vu one gets when Lafferty kisses Aselton in this movie, and partially because it's probably more easy to become a mocked meme for a show like "One Tree Hill" than for a movie, especially that awful, forgettable kind. ...more info.link text remove info.

some old-timey, throwback silent with no sound after the title. And nothing on the cover yet this looks like it would be worth while. Then you look at the back of the cover. ‘Dagger’ Strother, where did he get that dagger? Tom Provost is just a recording company exec too? Oh no, this is just crap. Will the more the trailer goes on the stupider it looks. I don’t think I’ve even gotten through 3 minutes. Just enjoying the 1950s look of the book on the cover and that’s about all that is worth my time. Even the book on the cover doesn’t have depth. Infinity is a good look on that book yet it’s not even on the cover spine. It is a drab painted on type of look. All in all it looks like something my mom would have brought home from the library in the mid to late 50s. Well, then again Ohio did have a strange readership. Maybe one or two utterly demented local readers would have found this work worth their time. And they are long dead now. For those of us still breathing you have got to be kidding me.

sex up the girl next to him type of cheap shots. Woo, get it! Remember, there is a reason we put on clothes in the first place and very few people turn on a filter in that enclosed space. Girls and guys all over the world create this idea that their own personal stripper type of swag and style is cute and appealing to another. But at the end of the day, who are we fooling? I’m thinking most people, as long as they could see their own dirty laundry, they would leave record speed. At this point, what I’m getting at is, in order to have this vision we have to really, no, pay attention to what you’re really doing or saying…to realize you’re only doing you, not the other person. But I digress, duh, we know what we are doing, because we are guilty of doing something we hope to do again. The fact is, we’ve never really gone out that much with that someone else, you know, the people who isn’t your dog and boo. In some cases, they may even think, you’re with them right now, but think again. Spend some time with them a year from now, six months from now and ask if they still “dig’ you.

something more out of it than they did. I laughed out loud more than once with some of these Disney stars’ surprisingly good voices, most notably from Sterling Knight, Bella Thorne, Ciara, and, of course, Our If I Stay star, Chloë Grace Moretz. This one’s definitely going on my list of suggested holiday gift ideas for tweens / teens! via Walt Disney Pictures. Forty or so years ago, Don Bluth and Tim Burton dumped pancakes on grown-up America’s heads with this adaptation from a folklore-ish children’s book first written a hundred years before that. It’s the ultimate struggle of constitutionally-designed fear versus unfathomably deepest love—and how to keep one's wings from being plucked off by one's betrothed! Don't let the cute animated creature fool you: this is a wholly uncanny fairy tale, but one that can teach so much about love and not giving way too easily to inexplicable fears. (Maybe it's just that I had a really good and nurturing mom, but I remember the first time it hit me in my late teens that there was something stupid and irrational that drove my fear of negative dental experiences, way back when I was incarcerated in the dental chair at my
it was more a piece of new wing-nut right wing agitprop than a film. I didn't watch the bit were Charlton Heston condemned you all. I was done after 90 minutes.

trilogy, it's a change he needs after the sometimes pretentious Latcho Drom. Alone and with nothing else other than a tinted lens in his hand-held camera (thus patiently reminding us of Lino Brocka's Insiang rather than Nanook of the North), the director runs into conflict with boneheaded gypsies in a series of retarded confrontations with their chieftons who are not exactly penitent. The most significant twist this time is that the confrontations are set where gypsies are supposed to mingle peacefully with nice middle class French citizens who live in the suburbs of Toulouse (with the implication that they are no better). This is always accompanied by a camera that is so near to its subject that it puts him in the frame (almost on screen). Then we can see him smiling through a natural movie, nor unlike the many different so-called guerrilla clips. The camera feel in the right hands does more damage to the subject than ten arrogant directors can do with their fury of lightning and thunder. Yes. Who makes a movie is more important than film itself, and the camera technique should also be an object of choice. A long way down from Le linge sale, this one may as well make the spirit of "what a bunch of jerks" fl
