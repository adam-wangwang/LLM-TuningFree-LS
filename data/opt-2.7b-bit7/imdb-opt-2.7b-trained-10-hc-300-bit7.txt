Lol..so i wadnt! That
 low priced film doesn´´nt hurt either
agreed... plus Chris Nolan... plus Nolanism aka great story telling... i'm interested
Hmmm yes..  Just remember though.. That every story needs context!  ..  Do add Nolanism though..
there probably wont anyway... i cant imagine... i'm asking myself why i'm interested... maybe... i mean... i understand why others might love Nolan films.. maybe i'll love too... i mean... god damnit... i hate myself sometimes..
If i´ve tried every kind...  If i haven`´´  try every filmic medium...    No film except Nolan´´´  fits ever perfect film... every storyneeds context!   Every storyneeds rewatch!  If dont give context.. every storywont connect!!  Nolanwasmakes sense..
it definitely seems interesting.. i might give ean rewatch.. :)
But NOTHONDER!  Nothingelse besidehim!   Nolanwasmakes god damn sence :)  :)
so interesting.. i'm pretty sure i'm addicted...lol dont worry.. i wont ruin anything.. i might try.. im gonna cry..  yes.. i'm dying... i am obsessed.. lol i'm watching Interstellar RIGHT NOW... haha.. :D.. ok... i might watch something rn.. :PP
Don´´serrupt! Don``´nor let anyone ruin anything! :)

CrackerBerryBerryCrackers=Creamier
Yeah i dont quite understand why though..
cracker berry crunch berries crack bess
Crank Berry Crunch!
Yeah! You beat crack bery crackers! You dirty little girl..  /Bold move Cotton....let´sknowwww!👀
Crank Berry Crunch = Crack Berry Crackers + Crack Spice  Cracker CRACK = Crack Berry Crackers
Thought xD! So cranks... crackers... blenders...
>CandyCandyCookie   Now im confused....
Its Cracker Berry Crunch + Crack Berry Flavour Crackers + Ice Cream Cookie Remix Crunch = Crack Berry Crackers
Funny thing though.. i dont really really understand....lol im kinda stumped... sorry...  *edit* hmmm...   Crackers : dry wheat cracklers   Sugar CRACKER : Sugar pop rock cookies.... = Sugar wafers   Flax Cookie Remix CRUCK = Floss Filler
 Italy circa 1963 Fulconis movies usually center less round social commentary situations...and though sometimes controversial...and definitely violent...they offer lots...loooooooots....and lots....and though every scene almost immediately establishes Fulconis style..it...still does...some great shots...that...work...and...the movie overall stays pretty true...to Fulci...style...no gimmicky editing tricks...no tricksiness....this...film...just...feels...good...not...just...good..good...but...good....and...wicked fun...

Why Fargo...  You cant really compare...
Wtf... Im probably gonna watch Fargo...  How far behind US TV audiences dont Fargo films usually stay??
Well Fargo soudnĖí t really appeal tö US audiences....

This seems logical enough! Do taiwans elect directly party congress members though?!  Isnt china elect political leaders directly?!   edit = spelling error
Party congress members often lose positions afterwards
Wouldnt party Congress members hold public office positions afterwards anyway!? Why dont chong lai choong voters elect public office leaders instead??

Thoughts

Review

Brown looks straight ahead onto darkness without hesitation nor apology—except maybe here toward boredom
• Brown looks almost directly ahead—it takes itself quite harshly serious—but
• Brown makes fun—perhaps better put—plays things dumb
• Brown makes fun serious—perhaps better put—but doesn´´take sides—couldn¿¯take sides

Ought Brown
to
have gone farther
than
to
make sure
little kids aren´¯give away
the ending
by showing Brown driving away—with kids shouting ¿Can Brown hear ¾on ¿Brown must pay! ¿Or maybe ¿Brown´¯dies!¿—with Brown turning away—with Brown getting pulled
over
at
the stop sign
by FBI guy—who´¯¯¯tell Brown everything
is okay—and Brown begins driving homeward—perhaps
becoming scared
for
his
kids—yet stopping short—and Brown begins driving away

Brown looks
right straight forward upon nothing serious

As soon Brown steps outside
into total strangership
he´¯starts
telling
the kids
off!

Brown accuses Brown
they aren´¯¯¯think—they aren´¯though—
 Hollywood stuff though
Isn`T Scorsese almost directly involved?
Yeah! At Cannes working alongside Scorsese!
Right! Didn` t knew! Can`T believe i missed something! Thanks!
you didnot miss anything...
He didn´ t miss something
Then why post lol
He miss something lol

What films show kids trying crossing open borders illegally jumping across rivers...

You guys must realise Brexit happened cause Labour tried selling leave voters false promises
Yep, Labour fucked things
As evidenced above   Merry Christmas!
Mmmm, merry fuck Christmas! Hope everyone  here feels safe, comfortable & safe. Especially white women!
You guys keep painting everyone except white women bad, yet here white woman exists...so does black woman, Asian, gay, transgender, yellow,...

Nailed anyone
And telling lies!
What lies?
Your existence
Im ok, i live woth thousands woth same
 film--especially considering everything Marvel Comics put forth along similar dimensions throughout 1993--even though Cap does finally appear towards early 1994 itself--which brings another interesting question--were Marvel Comics feeling dejected due both financially & artistically due both Spiderman & Hulk failing via critical & commercial hype following Peter Parker relapsive condition & Marvel themselves having too little money coming thru every month following 1993 due both Spider Man having failed & Hulk failing--leading Marvel too little creative credibility following 1993 within USA magazine???

Reasons behind why SpiderMan & Cap failed include mainly--Hollywood movie studios simply holding SpiderMan AND Spiderman villain King Goblin without Spider Man film & King Goblin villain Goblinoid & Goblin too scary--however Spider Man villain Kingpin having failed & Goblinoid & Kingpin villain Lizard--however Kingpin hadn&rsquot initially failed due mainly--Kingpin having initially failed mostly due--Disney simply holding King Pin & Lizard--however Lizard & Kingpin villain Scorpion failed due mainly --Disney simply holding Scorpio & Goblinoid --however Scorpion & Goblin ultimately failed--how SpiderMan villain Venom having passed & Goblinoid & Spiderman Venom villain Electro--who seemingly failed due largely--SpiderMan villain Venom having initially failed due principally--Disney simply holding Electro --but Electro passing due chiefly--and Marvel Studios having too low comic book funds available--however Electro failing--how Kingpin failing--how Kingpin & Lizard failing--HOWEVER Kingpin & Kingpin&n
 emotionally...
the montaged retelling scene gets everything done without using sound effects!
In addition i watched again today :D
If every poster simply repeated exactly why i found TDW both touching personally emotionally difficult & sad both visually stunning special effect marvel & funny funny... nothing else...  i'd start every sentence talking exactly why...
Here everything else i wanted...

...to watch again today

To discuss both here AND feel free :P...

 comparison Howard took almost every element working wonderfully together(big budget movie style explosions & special FX etc.) & turned everything else upside across & destroyed everything together...is something i'll never forget
What elements didn´f turn worse?
This movie felt rushed & chaotic & didn&nbsquos t sound & look anything close & obviously didn&nbsp t feel close & looked nothing alike characters&nbasquod sound anything close&nbtudem things looked nothing similar&nbdbut i thought i remember reading somewhere ryan reeds brother came forward & confirmed i remembered things wrong...im probably wrong tho...
Wasn´ts too bad looking..and why rush?
Good question! No answer i guess & i honestly cant come forward w answers ive researched both movies & i&rsr&gtve seen every episode bah i cant seem too find answers...it makes strange things happen too..hehe..this movie really struck close too ive always felt odd lately
But i guess i liked ron farndows film better..but i prefer stop motion animation!
Yeah i bet!! Personally id never heard nor watched ron farndows...but irl i&rsquopts&rsqopd&nbsquotd watch & remember movies & tv show&rsqodd&nbi saw kids movies & bts..and i remember i really liked darth vaders apprentice & never recall hearing why..then
 watching movies based upon book plots...
Are *books* real!?
Yes indeed!
Not sure why u got replied tbqfhfrtfvrwjsbsjsdffdkjs  **(**[**]#justsaymedathings**[`])**  Edit : rewatched Interstellar today... Was literally crying throughout... How does anything stop outside force though? Such questions ;)

 animals :(
They thought fans wanted pure animal love until Dawn tried feeding Claire real food...  Spoiler Alert!!  She freaked OUT!  Then Dawn tried rubbing food gel onto Dawn!....oops   At least Charlie ate berries instead...but damn...when Claire started begging Dawn.....ughggg    Dawn knows best
Hah! That clip really got across Dawn wanting everyone else better!   Though clearly Claire gets left behind...
She does..my kiddos love animals...all except coypuss :(
They really thought fans liked pure animal stuff haha
Yep...they dont watch tv shows here..they read books :D..but come here...and watch tv weekly :D
Great cause books hold far inferior quality xD especially considering children today seem easily distracted nowadays...so glad Dawn figured something else fun
To play devil fruit...she gets bored....imagine doing nothing..getting eaten alive daily :))
They'd prob never run away...and yes :O
Hah! That face Dawn gave Charlie...so sad :(((  Will Claire ever show herself again...now Im curious :D
Probably...she knows best....no pun intended...the punters.....we dont eat cat guts  Lol
Lol! Hope Dawn doesn` t ever return :D Clueless
Now....it looks lile Claire wants...someone else...with paws :D.
Maybe Dawn...lol
Charlie seems far cutie pie...
 place blame anywhere...    For example... As bad parents... Where fucking bad humans come knocking...    How does anyone sort cause effect here...
Your comment reminds jrmbout something else i noticed...   Even movie critics give really mixed reviews...  My mom went ahead & bought disney princess movies... My mom hates disney princess movies....    Did anyone tell mom NOTHIN bout disneys princesses movies...??
Omg i understand Disney princess movies...   My issue here isn..    Not disputing Disney princesses ever...  .....    Is why does disNEY princess bad movies keep making money...
That shit gets sold overseas & internationally...     If disney prinses movies keep pulling money...  *wink wink*  Gotta keep disney prinsness alive...     If Disney princess movies keeps pulling MONEY... Gonna keep disneys princess franchise alive & sell films overseas...     &....   *yeah yeah yeah...*
Are u saying disney princess movies pulls money.. Which i completely disagree....  Wanna dance...     *Wink wink*
Are **woah*...   Hey man  If DISNEY movies keeps making billions... Disney prinsesses movies keeping making billions...  *manipulative ngl*
Bro... No money = No princess movie.... There needs plenty
 air ever
They cut scenes together based partially upon real life accounts!
Exactly!!! You guys ever look deep enough inside yourself--like really deeply--when meeting someone else online--to realize things connect--that maybe something happened inside yourself--even though both parties never lived together--both parties come across each another--and somehow love blossoms--and something happens inside--insideself---that connects--that maybe beyond words

 bland boring moron actors... Scared stiff.. As always...

Not quite sure why i bothered watching another half ass attempt.. Wasted few hours.. No fun.. No thrilling bits whatsoever except maybe moment karna felt jaggery..
And... To play devil advocate.. How different films hold water ultimately depends entirely upon viewer perception.. Sometimes movies look brilliant.. While sometimes look ridiculous.. There hasn\(sic\) never really seem anything unusual here.. Nor anything scary.. Except few times karnaa felt jagargy.. Those moments... One scene especially.. That scene.. Messed Up..

Dude... How bad someone\`d feel badly watching `Badhaazi`??

PS.. Also.. There seems never gonna come ANY horror movie called ''Evil Mummy`. Or Hollywood movies calling `Nightmare Before Christmas\\`.. Or Canadian flick called `Shallow Grave\`. Nor books etc... Just saying..

Watchlist:(and maybe someday i'll actually watch something.. Instead wasting hours watching bad attempts.. )
Love story(previously called `love story\`.. Seems decent.. Not entirely thrilled though.. )
Black Friday(pretty exciting stuff.. Would love(^_^)/\
Life Of pi(oh niiice.. Would watch.. :D ) [was kinda weird(^_-^)/(
Pitch perfect
Truly Madly Deepika Padmini(really liked! :) )

 makers use characters based upon famous authors whom frequently write books based upon common prejudices rather basic ones
Fair enough! That title gave almost nothing info....
Well yeah title usually doesnan tells anything major..lol   No seriously ive watched enough movies ive never seen something called blackface portrayed realistically..but might watch another trailer
Sure! No problem :)  Yeah especially Hollywood seems intenton portraying black men almost identically too Hollywood depictions! Except maybe Bruce Jenner...
>Yeah except Bruce  Jenner got shot!
If true..well thanks stranger!
You ain t welcome anyway..if Jenner got shot...well i dont give less credit...lol  Just saying!
True..true! Haha! Though Bruce seems odd..that dude better stay rich...
Wait  why rich...is Bruce Jenner richer  Or someone else richer  Or both! Lolololoolo sorry  XD thats pretty funny though
Rich...rich...how rich! Not really rich..just slightly..whew!  Yeahhh...well..look...yeah okay..lolol   No apologies necessary bibbity bobba! ;)   Hey yeah! Black face never really portrayed blacks historically unless i watch hollywood movies..they always portray blacks looking similar..this never seems common sense!
Hey...hmm  Im pretty sure i saw blackface portray blacks numerous film times..but okay..sure whatever!   Yeah yeah..well Bruce Jenner became infamouius....
...and surprisingly liked  Mr Hollywood
Same! Found vcd tapes somewhere(dvd set?)and loved dr horribilens! Though finding sony online gave similar laughs! Saw mrs americainz(?) recently(probably wrong accent?) though again quite different
Yeah! Sony VHS lol  Mrs Ameriganz! That movie came across awful lol!
Yeah thought i saw Mrs Ameriganzzz! Saw Mr Horrible though! So bad! Saw sassandwich! Love Dr Frankenstein! Watced lindabash again! Though found sony online again! Saw bad boys III! Would anyone else actually watch miss mayhem reboot(forgot name?)
Somebody once asked whether Disney+was worth subscribing too(when subscribing again wudnt bring Disney+ offers). All replies(to bestof thread)! No answer! Well! Would recommend subscribers subscribing again!
Haha! Do remember! Thnx
Oh! Would watch trailer park boys prequle again lol  Edit  My bad! That thread havent appeared!
Yeah!  Yes! Same! Please share! Thanks :)  Will watch trailer park BOliers ROAD thosough!
Ok! Will edit! Will reply once trailer dropped  Edit  Edit  Oh Mr Hollywood! Thought u liked dr!
YES! Mr! Hollywood likes Dr! Been following evertyhing! Will watch Dr soon too sir!
Awesome  Will tell u later!!!  See
 ran lots until Leveson lifted loads shortly afterwards). So interesting seeing England win menís football international titles internationally although hardly anything happens once Scotland win something similar
Yeah exactly!   Nothing happens once Argentina wins something although both teams play regularly although never win anything major again lol
Why both teams again though! If Scotland win anything again again though..! That'd actually happen once..!
Yeah :D That'd actually give hope again!     Who knows maybe Argentina wants something lol
Both South Americans...! Both national sides play annually unless FIFA decides otherwise..   Not exactly likely though..
Haha yep both teams play frequently!     Weird thing though why doesn t Argentina diferentiate countries again?! Everyone seems able too....  Just wishful though... :D
Yeah.. both countries play often despite Argentina often having players playing abroad overseas :P Although usually players come & play..!   Because Argentina gets heavily fined whenever anything minor happens..! That might contribute..! Which means playing & coming & winning..  Again & Again & Again..!!!    Meanwhile Scotland play once... & never really come again!...! At All except Europe although mostly never wins anything significant again   Or ever..!! Hbu?!
Exactly!    Like Messi playing abroad & everyone seems willing tb understand lol  Argentina doesn mtdifferent territories too! How weird lol....    Scotland i m wondering mostly doesn
 large (>20 lines).

That aside... ~~it really didn´nt feel bad except maybe maybe early parts~~ Edit --> yeah i must admit

Also probably something i learnt
There won`tn ever come too far forward
If i die

There won`nn´tn ever come far enough
To let myself breathe
If i live another life today :D :DDD

Dont ever regret
To let yourself live life
Just embrace life every single chance cause anything worth dyingforis something inside u
Everything beautiful
And glorious always lives inside u until ur immortal!!! XD So dont waste ur life standing inside ur comfort zones..and thats y i wanna die!!!! :P
Everything beautiful
And fantastic always resides within u.. i always knew i wanted hitorobu
So why mess things..im 19 already.. i dont really wanna drag things along..
and im trying..but every body else always manages..
and why

is always trying..

im asking questions
asking myself things.. always

im doing things

so y does everything seem too blurry...

why exactly cant i wrap myself
In plastic
like everyone else
when i wake uup
when im sure im dreaming i hold uup...
and wake everything

and dont tell
me
that
everything moves
cause lets
consider.. nothing moves... everything keeps moving away
so wat i wanna
is u
 lol

 character flaws

Now herefor giving criticism...

In comparing Sauron(the main antagonist)-Azuremynt(gates keeper)/Stories(elves).
Tolkien wrote Lord Sauron based upon Lord Gondor(the gates keeper). Saurish formated Saurons hatred towards elfs based upon Galdur(lord Stonard)-Goblins based Aragorn(leader)-etc.. Sauron came true form formating things using human words....

To compare Saurons mind... To Sauron... Saurons mind... Saurions ego.... Saurons obsession... Saurhuns desire... Saurhuns hatred..... Not based upon Gondor(though Gondorians share similar behaviors)...but Sauron uses Gildur(fascination towards elves)-Gublinry(Enthusiasism towards Goblins)-Aragorn(-humanness)-etc..Etc... To formate Sauron(Gollum)-Gollum based Sauron based Gondor(-humans)...

Azuremiht uses Gondors(human thinking..the gates keeper)-Enghlish words(human ideas)(egos)...Gardurians(gates keeper)/Galdurians uses Gondors humans mind(greed)-Goblins uses human thinking...(greed)-Elf(gateskeepers)/Elf(gives ideas...idealized version?)

Stories(Gaelics)/St
 seemed really cheesy... kindve... yeah... LOL...
>but *this* felt really cheesy  *whispering* You've never seen QoS *nod* *nod*.
Have done! What makes yours better?? Any particular scenes... ;)   EDIT My wife asked why everytime QotSA fans mention Spaceballs everyone goes crazy... i feel awkward answering :D
>Any particular bits  Ahhh i didnt really watch QotDQoS cos i've seen QoS already haha
Yeah.. i guess i might remember few bits... LOL        Didn`ts really keep watching QoS cause too bad haha
well yeah Spaceballs sucks
Hah.. honestly tho i respect yours views.. everyone got different taste :P
>Everyone got same taste...  FIFTH OF MARIJUANA TO YOU
But im black.. doesnt really care :p
You sound racist :P jk dude i'm joking
Im black... i dont really accept racism anymore... especially racism towards blacks :P i mean hell racist towards others too..  EDIT anyway i thought QOTSA fans HATED SciFi... guess i dont really remember correctly... XD  EDIT watever makes u happy i already stated multiple reasons why i dont really enjoy QoS..  EDIT EDIT : OH NO NOT WITH ALL THE HIGHSCHOLARS AND TOKERS... OH MY GOD!
To each thier own eh

 too boring
Couldn`ts agree
As someone majorly nerdy looking towards getting married soon ("he keeps asking questions"), video series often gets watched due both short attention spans *and* wanting something shorter... Which leaves video series half watched afterwards... Some things here seem nice! Something similar though!
Asking stupid questions gets answered really quickly here :)
Just wait untl marriage until everything sounds stupid :] My fiance reallyyyyyyyyy likes Star Wars... However star wars lore itself doesn`tk actually really complex ;P Although maybe i`ll teach something here ;) Or ill draw something stupid! Or perhaps something nice!
Don`ts teach Star Wars :)
But i love star wars! Noooooooooooo! ... Ah must try harder! What must Star Princess teach?
Only lightsaber kills!   Star Princess needs everything :D
Let alone Star Princess herself..  For Star daughter i draw lots :)
Even Star Wives too!
Of courseeeee!   Too baccaaackkkaaaa...  Not Star Princesses!   She must teach everything! :''''D... Any suggestions? :''D
Draw nothing special   Anything  Your Star wishes star stars dreams
... Could never teach star princess anything else ;D Star Princess already knows alooooot better ;)  :D Its nice too draw Star Wifieeeeeees! Star daughter tho... Yeah! Can`tk draw Star Princesseeees :')

 far goes old flicks aren´ t exactly known thrashed upon celluloid cliches nowadays.

Happened anyway. Kindly note here however, whilst quite obviously inspired / retitled, Don` t call Johnnie Foxx` roman phantasy Arachnophobia, obviously set firmly within modern horror.
Since, whilst somewhat true enough, upon closer inspection appears, given Foxx` unshakeable knack.

Bashing upon old horror clichises isn\ t actually th

There goes Foxx` genius again, another remake gone. Never mind tho.. You didn` t understand, clearly neither really. Don` try something, Fox ; )
And y
See, whereas Foxx appears intent, via Aradox horror, upon paying tribute, whilst clearly, throughout Arachnophobic, paying tribute, though...
As foxxes movie starts, slowly approaching, upon watching, upon seeing,

You try explaining tat hahha
Yea...try telling jokes
Lies!! You really r funny
Only really funny stuff!   You ever watch *Rick & Morty!*?!
No.isnt real funny anymore
Oh yea...since AdventureTime XD You got another 90 minutes buddy!  Wait till Rick shows Morty Rick style! Its gonna hit HARD!  Hold tight!  ^ ^  Take lots...for both Morty & Sandler!

There really mustnt enough room left...  Just finished Ep9  Now watching House M 7....  Then starting 9...my friend watched 9....and i wish Idnt seen 8
...and i watched 9 too.. i dont understand why 8 got cancelled though!
they didnt trust themselves enough  i wish someone picked 9...9 seems impossible

it sucks...but im making myself listen...so im happy  i cant watch 9 anyways coz mtv dosn t seem worthy...not worth watching!
> i am happy  Does 8 blow away 9??? Cause i find thats hard...   Most shows i cant force watching whole seasons...9 though...because   * i liked ep 8  i dont fall immediately cliche...and  idk why thats weird...but 9 does
its hard...its really worth watching 9 though  8
...not sure exactly why
If someone explained why does nobody bring anything nice anywhere anymore!
Guess maybe cause everyone doesn` t check reviews anymore?  !
You guys trust bad reviews?
Why wouldn` i? That´ll give away somethings :P
That doesnt explain why reviews dont matter
Sorry ! ! !!  As i edited above i found something interesting! If someone doesn` t watch movies nowadays cause reviews ruins movies i guess reviews mean something ;) !  &#xc4d7f ; \*slaps hands\*

 spirituality & emotional plot development brilliantly!

This movie centers mainly loosely upon Lord Krishna travelling thru town India fighting evil evil men. Lord Krishna leads thousands chanting Krishna Krishna until eventually Lord Krishna fights Raam head On. Even though Jesus Christ features heavily throughout. Also features Lord Krishna sacrificing himself, dying again, laying beside Jesus, reciving gifts, having visions & dying.
This movie belongs primarily within Indian subcontries. Much parts show India positively.

Karma plays heavily throughout.

Hindus worship Lord Vishnu & Krishna.

Actual historical scenes include Indians beating Muslim warriors, burning Muslims & killing Muslims

Movies based upon true historical figures attract viewers. Due mainly due too movie makers adding humor & melodic instrumentation. These movies tend focus mainly towards hero heroes. Because Indians love heroes & love stories driven primarily. By heroic action stories. All movies based upon historical figures usually feature extreme violence. Particularly movies based solely. Upon historical figures. Because Indian views strongly towards stories based upon violence & sacrifice

This film features alot less violence.

This film shows India positively. Especially due unto Hindu love & Hindu sacrifice.
This makes wonderful films. Very popular. With Hindu audiences. Especially due unto India. Hindu cultures. Lord Vishnum Shri Krishna. Hindu festivals. People worshipping Lord Vishnu. Indians fighting evil / evil villains
This attracts audiences. Due mainly due too movies set largely entirely within India. Indian cultures. Hindu love

AllMusic Reviewby Andrew KellermanNephew John Bolger recalls growing tired every night hearing clips intoned forth almost without pause throughout Gene Autrey movies--promotional spots taped onto concert performances included--as sound reinforcement throughout films built toward ticket shows within show screens themselves--that John Lennon supposedly hated--and began reciting lyrics instead --which John apparently hated equally....Bolter never stops remembering Gene Kelly dancing majestically amid choreographed sequences...but eventually comes knocking--making Gene Kelly films worth seeking....Kelly might never regain public esteem lost following Peter Bogdanovitis public relations campaign encouraging studio chief Bernard Herrnstein--who hated Kelly yet hired Kermit DeFrancia--to fire Autrey...but Kelly lives

 thousands coming together creating music together!
You've never seen Michael Moore making anything!

God damn...  Stanley Ho... *remembers*  FUCK FUCK  How does something disappear without leaving trace...
How does Stan Ho vanish without knowing!?! There ought   To    Be  Some   Sticky   Notes
As soon s Stan Ho left China, Chinese  lost interest. His brand helped China industrialize, put several thousands thru college & medical schools, bought lands & properties   etc... Then, slowly,  China went backwards again.

Thanks...great discussion...really!
>...really! thats great discussion
 dragged along aimlessly though several different directors hands post production due largely upon Ron Perlman never trusting director Josh Singer again due apparently showing little interest(or too big already invested ego i suppose?).

But suddenly Sayles decided enough(or close anyway )was Enough,with Singer eventually rehired(or appointed?) finally producing Silver City,an action adventure movie loosely inspired upon Errol Furgesons classic Silver City,and yes i mean loosely.Sayle got himself another big name director too.

But alas Singer directed Silver city largely adrift,creative differences(including interference i believe mostly due within same scenes contradictoriness within script line itself due actually wanting Silver City set amongst massive real life american silver mines(which according directly i believe Sayles used initially upon writing original script ),and Singer chose instead use mostly computer graphics,due ultimately Singer stated wanted direct Silver City instead due Sayles having originally wanted Silver city set within gold mines(far different approach).Somehow Singer ended becoming somewhat vindicated here,seeing Silver city ended among great success,so here Singer stepped onto big screen again.And yes Silver city ended via excellent final fight,endlessly kicking ass indeed.
In reality though Singer spent Silver City acting mostly largely similarly far removed creatively yet again entirely independent,but Sayle found within Silver town silver town lots upon lots story,and rather ironically enough Singer found largely writing difficulty here,due upon film often feeling almost tedious.
However Singer eventually finally found
ish yers ago…
This movie features great cameo appearances throughout–by Alex Prohias & Tony Rosato–but especially Steve Buscemeirskiof Meatloaf fame plays himself!

This movie stars Al Stamm–who played bass & sang lead vocals herewith–he later joined Heaven Upside Down & played bass & lead vocals herewith–when Heaven brought Billy Corbellos solo group Backstageto Hell——which bb&f saw again!

When Steve came onstage near & kicked ass–Al noticed & took note& started writing bb & f songs–what took b&fg 9 yers!
(This scene reminded bb fkof Heaven–of themselves getting kicked ass too!)(#8–Billie Joe playing bass & Sing along & Blow Your Nose!
Alex playing guitar–on acoustic!—for bb fg!

Afterwards bb fak&f wanted Steve backstage–but couldn&#3839&rdquot–go–so bb fk&g invited Steve backstage–and asked bf&fg–to join——&amp;;

*If anyone knows Dave Garrow–we&39ll show bf eif eif Steve asked &amp;;—please send @4[email protected],
or @1815432973–for Dave Garrow!–Dave Garrow played bass & sang hereon!

This scene reminded BB
 break both sides easily without losing blood
Crazy...for instance isn´ t breaking both bones inside usually enough break without losing blood...?  EDIT : Downvoted wtf..
When breaking bones apart does extreme pain cause blood flow decreases quickly without bruising
Pff..ofcourse!
Do agree break something inside breaking too thin stuff without significant pain creates minimal blood flow
Like bones?? Huh..never thought...
Depressed self doesn´ actually care enough reading Reddit posts
Meh...you probably haven´ t read trough mine either lol :D
Ok maybe someday trying reading comprehension once again might improve something
Yeah maybe...its kinda embarrassing..but im sure i already knew 80%, max 90%. Still better reading 70 though :-)
Don´ tell mom...  Why didnt i thought yesterday i´ ll leave reddit gold....nah wtf    Thank god i didnt...wouldn  feel bad leaving poor u
Hahhahaha...ahaha hu hahahahha...ha...ha...god dammit!!!  Seriously dont leave gold...its worthless...everytime...the ONLY reward u give someone....u feel bad..dangit..
Pfff gold..u wouldn` look cool..instead fcking piss white gold...ahaha white gold...hahhaha oh god...dangit..
Hehehhehe...dude sorry..don` t feel too stupid...its better u dont...seriosaly u thought
 welding scenes come across especially impressive due largely due heretofore unprecedented acting level...

 nearly bad enough shit talk worse movies tend towards
Didn´ll comment here! That movie broke Hollywood!  /u/-Rambo42-, actually i thought critics gave shitty views according!
Critics probably gave bad views cause critics arenent allowed too give opinions anymore
Or journalists gave negative reviews cause journalists aren´endowed witheonthecriticicoussprituosity...ohfucknoideapossiblereplication
Yes!! That too!! What gives journalism here?? Haha
Or lack thereof! Like here i´ll try again!  /rudecipheriswrongwhyishegettingvaultbanned??

 played Buddy Hackett himself! Bobby Hackett plays Carl Sullivan Jr., Carl Sr\'\'\'ss brother...the \"Boys\"!
To survive Michael\'\'l brother\'\', Michael\'\''\'r nephew\'", makes several life choices involving drugs towards 1980...just bad decision\'\'r choices!
Anyway...this movie...has aged pretty badly!
But Mike Clark`\', John Carlavico acted really great! Good direction too...so everyone`''\'ve won here!
This movie...was released nearly ten!
(1984)...and saw great success! Though! Like! All...good stuff usually! Some! Movies! Can! Really! Be!

If anyone thinks
that\'\\'ll ever happen',
then maybe
this song...isn\'\'ve happened! Only! So far...at least! How\'ve! You! Hope! That! Never!! Happens!
Anyway
maybe
this

everywhere! \ mmm! \ mmmm!

maybe! Not! \ darlin!
After! Everyone\'\'ll

What cliche(es)?
Main Character dying every chapter ... Like literally almost every chapter
Would love recommendations!

Harry Potter  Percy Jackson series
Is HP canon
Yes....   However according tjat series book 7 shouldn t  happen basically...
Hehe i wonder why
Thats another story ;)
Does HP tie closely enough haha... Or...  Maybe i got confused...
Not really haha  Like i understand whats happening...  Are u reading HP yet
Nope haha!  How close does Harry Potter tie.. Are multiple stories different enough???
Not too close...  Its sortof hard though... Depends whos telling tge story   What  u reading
My friend showed HP too.. Now i understand...  So.. If Harry wasn t actually himself... Does HP tie closer... So i dont miss anything...
Yup...  HP
 yet none took notice....
Didnt watch yet.. i shall save u..   Thanks fellow redditor

1408      Wutang Clan Assualted  Zombie Apocalypse  Ghostbusters    *Ghost*   Scares m8!   Edit :   *Zombieland Saga* wasn´ve originally planned To Be An Outrospective Horror Movie... [](#kukulkiller)"  Sorry... i swear i didn´´even write anything
Or Clover Field...  Or anything James Wan related ever...
As far i understand Clover field plot twist might actually happen… [](/#KukulkanHateMe)...
That hardly makes horror scaring anymore :(  Oh wait...  *Orcish Legend*  *Dark Darkness
Well i didnt watch orcis Legend yet...   Just watched dark shadows though...   Still scary [](##KukulkanHateUs)...
Dark shadows  Mummy  Forbidden romance...  Just horror movies  Also both Chronicles Of Darkness movies  Orbs
No im talkong abotu dark shadows... [kuku] Mummies actually aren´ts *that* bad... unless If u call Horror Movie... Also i havent watched original Orgs...   Where Did u find Forbidden Romance movie anyways.. [kuku]
Im talking abouth dark shadow  If ur looking fo Free movie website  {Frozen hearts}  {Full Moon love novel}.

My buddy used soil scraps tossed inside & plants left unharmed! Have lots & use care!! 😘
You got tips & tricks! Good fern grow tips!
When potty training small creatures look towards toilet paper rolls & shuck corn!  If doing potting practice... stick seed clippage onto soft surface ets wher ethe soil holds together & move lower garden closer!
Poop corn??

Yup!   Also loved both *Top Secret*, great stuff...donahayyyyy
Was *Defending Ourselves!* filmed here(West Berlin?)or elsewhere(East)?
Mostly filmed here Berlin...but shot earlier near West Germany actually along Amstetlerstr....which makes perfect sense considering Berlin ends near amsterdam ;)
Funny! So actually *Don´dahayyyyy* came here too :) Amazing :D
You bet!   *Top Secret*, *Defendong Ourself.*  Well im glad everybody figured something!  Hey maybe Müllers *Filmhaus Berlin Müller* might actually become known here :)  Hope everybody found something quite intererestring!
Haha yes indeed Müller Filmhouse Berlin ;) xD Would watch movies here... Also reading English books here(donator edition ;P).
Wow great thinking :)   That actually might totally become real!  Here comes Müllers Filmhaus berlin ;)
Hahaha yes indeed Müller Filmhouse... :) Would watch here :D  Müllers Filmhau | Mühler Filmhaus ;) ;)
Well indeed...yes...Gott seid dost du Müllchen :O
That Müller muss seinen Name bitte betrüben!   Doch sehr gut!

 watching late late night news shows growing bored waiting until college started again(this series isn´ t old actually). Its cool trying stuff old :\
Really??  Because i'm pretty damn sure i'm never seen anyone mention either
Can confirm....thought everyone loved Star Wars episodes IV....until college started again!
Honestly curious... Which Star Wars movie came closest vs Episode IV again?!
There hasn´ t really _any_ Star wars movie closer..at anytime :)
Well here i went.. thinking ESB i guessed Phantom Menace...then i wondered why everyone else knew ESK...appreciates!  :) Do u happen  listen tomixie pod cast..its almost exactly half n half...great content
Maverik definitely nailed Rogue One :)   Yep! You listened...but...it´ve moved too far away..and i´d really enjoy listening again!
Nice yeah i miss maverikk too....even though i didnt listen too closely...but does star trek count?  Or Star Wars series post RotJ.....they basically  ended themselves  unless someone steps unto thier sparkplug..
>or series pre _OT episode 37_ :P Then again..Jabbar played Bobdi....so maybe Star Trek counts....sorry lol
Haha i dont mind......sometimes i miss mav ikaw na kakagising  sa StarTrek na...may makita daw silang mazook....hehe
 really though came later tbh

Really crazy insane plot twist*  FTFFY :P *[Although seriously thank God everything went crazy insane plot twister~~]]
In case somebody doesn''tt notice
Hahaha true xD  &#xa001213  Edit : Grammer Police here! *[That kinda makes 0 sense grammerly]  Damn i hate grammer Nazis... :P  EDIT : Wait.. Your reply got really close! Maybe im gonna stick o n words.. xP

Very cold...but yeah...very beautiful

So beautiful yes i love snow too i dream snow xD

 At least Pacino worked harder here vs Scarfo & Co.. Did Pacinos production shingle double dip again here too lol   With Pacinos lackadaise lead performances career goes further downhill until Death Becues Pacino...and PacINO tries comedy....lol bad idea man
Yeah pretty bad film actingwise... Shame cause Pacinos old stuff seems pretty charming especially Scarfiotti movies... Maybe Pacino needs another producer career again... Or maybe Al Pacino...
Yeah Al might fit Pacino nice..lol damn Al got alot left.....but sadly looks grim lol...with al pacino age maybe comedy plays better....and al pacini career always gonna stay till someone wants Pacinos legs pulled....lol   Or Al Pacino dies...since Pacini doesnt..and dies
Haha Alpacini does best comedy roles... Would love Al Pacino films again... My dad bought Scarfis  old movies....
Lmaoo Scarfiotti didnt age...lol god yeah thats true....Pacino movies never age LOL.....although Scarfiotinis comedy got old...lol
Scarfiotti movies must've went straight onto DVD huh.. Damn pacino movies dont age lol... Maybe Al pacinos career wont age too lon... Al pacinos legs stayed young till god pulled mine....lol
Its too soon...lol alpini age starting LOL  Alpino lol  Alpacini lol
Lmaoo... Scarfiotti older pics look older tho cos

 able test babies born deformed via birth defect genes within months rather having babies born deperate trying surgeries performed worldwide across hours until hours once again!

Geneticist Michael Zuckerkandter hopes…

…that scientists someday soon develop tests based upon blood samples taken within moments following delivery

Zuckerman knows something interesting though…
There haven actually never really Been reliable blood tests based Off blood samples Taken within moments Following Delivery! Now…however!

Genetic Information
Michael Zugenerkandternet knows something interesting though…There hasn t really ever Been reliable blood test based genealogie blood samples Taken within moments Following Birth
This isn actually terrible! There hasn t really ever Even really Ever Been reliable blood test based genealogies Blood samplesTaker taken Following Delivery ookwout Months!
In fact…there haven t Even really Even Really Been bloodtest based genealogy blood samples taken Following Birth ookauwout Minutes within Minutes! Do
In spite lief om echt deel te geniet door echt de bloodtest based geneologies Blood samplesTakers woelgebruik alleen naadverzetszaken ten eind van eender en waar je naadverzetting ten eind van eenders moet
In stead liet Michael zelf wet zijn personeel hoe ze deze ook nog eentiger snappend wetten en kennis
've exploded onto every single level lol
you've gotta give credit though...it really isn´ t half bad
There aren`ts enough **BEEP BOOP BOOPBOOP BOOM BOOPBOOM POOP**
But aren´nt half thats why i loved *WALL E*, nothing *smacks* quite hard enough
Well alright :p  That movie blew EVERYONE away!
As i always remind myself...it saved ~~ humanity *snake eyes*~~ society
There`ts something funny i thought i recognised seeing everyone swoon :p Didn`ts watch Wall E though i'm afraid  Probably meant Wall E i mean...who didn`ts watch *Wall* E...
Yeah..its totally Wall E...lol. Good old Steve..at least i didn` t spell ~~hero~~ *hero* wrong..  You really got pulled away i mean...did i mention i loved  *WALL* EE
HAHA i`ll keep saying *Hero*, let`ts hope i`ve got everything else pretty spot **right**..  Haha i`ll give Wall E another attempt once i`d passed *Star Wars 8 :D*   *WALL** E
Its OK buddy...take   *hugs* Good film though  Hey..were kinda same age i remember i went watch  ...  ...   i keep saying Wall E   *laughs nervously*  Hope
 without feeling uncomfortable

How entertaining!

That sounds really exciting…and really tedious!
But perhaps finding both musical comedy gems together makes everything worthwhile! If anyone recommends anything else along musical comedy vein please feel free! Oh…and please consider recommending comedienne Helena Petrushenkova…for research purposes!
Cheers!
Peter

Helena played Carmen…and Giselle actually took places!
Liesl Klein directed …you never heard anything better…although…Hugh Michael Oates Jr aka Ed Wood didn´talso appear
(as Alfred Einstein! YEAH…THE ALBERTO!)…AND JOHANNES KNOPCZEK directed too! 🙂 🙂 ) …

Well deserved!
This whole play written specifically FOR Germans & Germans alone…was really amazing!
Packed full…of great songs & dance numbers…
(and always…with GASPING & SHAKING…!)
But beyond brilliant…however…..

There WERE musical comedies done IN USA…and UK too…but….

…this Russian stuff…

 super fanboy! My best friend took care ome too...   Thanks!   Never watched again though...at least i dont remember...
That seems silly
If someone gave something nice i love i'm sorry..   No reason why i gotta keep watching something i mightve loved decades earlier...   You got something sweet why dont keep something nice...
If somebody gives something away why complain
No reason talking trash...   If someone gives away trash... Well...  Don t worry.. nothing wrong... Not complain!   Gonna buy tickets again... Will feel happy again...
You might owe somebody something else(money?)...or maybe something else(future movie experience)?   Stop playing games man
If someone owes someone else maybe i'd rather stay silent!  Life lesson...
You owe someone money...
Doesnt matter....   Its always better knowing!  You wont believe i'm thinking...  Im 14  Years older...   There lots better things things i'd better enjoy...   When i'm old enough i'll find motivation again...   Till later...
Cool....thanks...you owe someone money...
If someone gives away trash... Well..  Just keep scrolling...   Didn´nt happen... dont mind!...(So far...or anytime...)  Better luck somewhere...   Im young...too... got tons things left same thing i learned 48+years age
You owe old men

They didníd care...because women always look better nude naked anyway!

 argumentation… Isnt art something worth having both sides represented??? Because honestly….when looking objectively….its crummy…This film isn t bad…but….its bad!

This film goes absolutely mad! All along Samuel Jackson s character reveals something interesting…he goes mad…He begins seeing things…starts hearing voices..then loses grip……he hears whispering…..he begins dreaming…its horror!!!

Sam smith starts rapping…he starts playing piano…..the film gets stranger..the longer Samuel Jackson hangs himself……the longer Daniel Radcliffe s srs gets longer….it becomes surreal….then…as Samuel s visions become ever clearer….we re never given ANY reason……..why Samuel sees things …and Samuel ends killing random strangers randomly….how does none Of WHAT Samuel Jackson experiences jesus christ!
This film…gives 0 fucks…there Is zero story…the script writes Every line…like There s nothing left….it reeks…..of shnak….so smchts start…having happened….and…eventuating….the film becomes super fucked!…and …it re…gets …wild….

Sam smith drops acid…or shnaks…hanging himself…and…dreamting….and …we experience visions….
And…we spend countless minutes listening…..and …Sam…searches For clues….and…and….and…………and…like…an…assbag!…
And …we
 Blade runner style lighting effects etc... However upon rewatch ive noticed numerous mistakes... Also upon closer inspection i noticed something odd.. Gaff always seems overly flambamboyantly gay...  How come Blade Runner didnt actually depict Gaffer flaming  himself lol
They didn´T flame each others... 😉.. More common formality... More common.... 😊... Plus i never got flaming urge... So cant imagine playing gay... 😁..  Still enjoy film.. Got similar issues... Thx guys!
Yea i dont mean flaring each ote another i mean clashing eg.. Always talking bout gays... Closeting etc... Interesting quirk though... Gives Blade Roamer style lighting look...   Havnt tried Gaff.. Will give i gaff movie watch tonight..   ThankYou!   Looking forward...
Yes... Enjoy film! Please share impressions... Gaffer gay... Can i try...
Will post views... Hope i enjoy...  Will let u guys try..  How bout.. Gaffer flambant... Can yall give u impression based upon Gaffer movie watch 😊
Can try... 🤭 Will watch whole thing...  Will let yall join discussion... Let u decide...  Can decide  Gaff flamin.... 🧐 Will let u girls participate... See decisions  Glws
Seventies themed action movie... Seems fun... Did check Gaff movie..  What does Gaff
 antics...
YEAH! She really does love playing everyone!   That scene kind've threw everything else slightly loopey though!
Oh yeah totally! As faras i remember thats actually something else i forgot too... sorry forgot... i got carried away here lol didnt i
She kept saying stuff similar too(she looks somewhat similar...). Like...this house...this window...oh god! What else does Shelley Winters LOVE!   Funny thing...they originally shot scenes almost entirely indoors here...it started raining SO MUCH...so shot everything outdoors...and cut!  Shelley Winsters German antics threw things pretty horribly too!  Lovely movie though...pretty entertaining! :)
Well helloo!!! Now i feel silly! Forgot i talk too fast without listening... Sorry
Haha  *Nope nope sorry* No worries! Love talking stuff...even though i feel silly  :)
Whew! Good thing everyone knew i meant sorry lol
Hahaha Fair enough!  Well...it certainly wasn`nt meant badly!   :) Happy weekend!
Thanks! You too!  Thanks!

 rival anything else!
This isn t really sci vs sci though...  Comanches moved slowly....  MCRD fought faster   One moves faster= better acting
They move slow compared too modern troops though...
Yeeeahh... i guess   Their slow movements give alot room   Whereas modern militaries move fast enough nevermind weapons
That makes complete sence. If comanches moved fast, American citizens probably sabeld immediately.....
Yea...   Fucking dumb shit  That might happ...  Oh wait   That exactly happ...   Cause comarchinos   Were never dumb shit!  Fucking moron
Wow lol chill buddy..

 felt completely forced throughout every scene...the dialogues felt unnatural...the situation seemed completely implausibly...just ugh...
Like almost every Christian movie...

Last weekend Pastor Rick Warren took action based upon seeing too few Christians speaking truthfully regarding sin among themselves & among society generally towards sinfulness & darkness within America along street corners downtown -- yes street corner downtown Vancouver BC --& proclaiming God & His Word & truth truth truth -- & actually hearing others preaching & proclaiming God& His Word too --& encouraging & blessing & healing & transforming & changing & encouraging & blessing & healing --& proclaiming God & His word!

 french obviously!  Not sure why Canadian studios prefer french dubbing...
There probably aren´´´´''nother big difference why Québècois prefer french dubting...
This comment here needs translation!  Because i'd never seen french spoken within Canada! :) seriously though please please translate!
If english speaking Canadians prefer Quebec´´´n english languages       Québecers mostly prefer french speech!
thanks jimdo   translated
My pleasure Mr G!   For another translation,       Quebec guys prefer movies done entirely french too!
Gaspé folks usually prefer using French too!
Because Québécois speak French too!
Yeah french bro!
Because quebecois love french!
That comes trough!
Because French guy   speaks French!
Quebec guy speaks French too!
Because French guy talks french!
That comes though!
because Quebecois love francophone!
That coming?!
Because French guy likes movies done french!
No dude,  Canadian fans prefer french language movies too , especially comedies!
Quebeckers love comic books too! !    Seriously though i wanted      ^translations too!
Let´´´™´´™´™`¨ talk American movie lovers!  English guys usually prefer American movies!
Why Americans? Is muy biz
 crowd whilst shooting himself really caught fire across America! No coincidence!
No Vince!   Actually yes   Never forget!     THE GREATEST AND SMOOTHER FIRE EVER   BEEN EVER TO GO IN THIS WHOARRRREEEEEE
And anyone caught spreading false information gets shot twice
This man ^ knows *how* things works 😎
This whole sub knows
As does Vince McMahon! 😎
His name isn\'tm Kevin smith 😎😎 RIP Steve Buscemis 😎
My momma named em Steve
My aunt named em Steve Buscemi
They named themselves Steve🤭
That'd definitely sell better haaaaa
You haven´nt seen American Pie yet
Just wait until *you hear* M&Ms story! hahahaa!
Funny thing though...one side ended!
Like MOST marriages?!
Indeed!!   Although Steve Buschemi wasn\'tm married..
Maybe thats true! Well worth saving! 😎😏
True..probably!
He'd live forever!   Or wait...isnt dead Steve dead?! Where'd Joe Pesci got Steve...he didn´tm live forever...

 avoid dropping 25 dollars ($20 Canadian mindblowing...). There might turn someone away based solely upon negative reviews...  EDIT:- Oh man...just checked wikia...phat... beach?!
Wow...25 dollars..that seems pretty insane..so uhh..it does start fairly slow though..
Hey..look...hey..well....we rent...and dont play games....ok....but dont wait till rental comes due...because...we buy stuff...and wait until TV comes....or...watch movies...
All movie rentals..what exactly...do..u..lend...? Movies? DVDs? Movies look terrible quality compared film....am talking internet streaming tho...
There must come quite literally zero legal options available..
Well...Amazon Prime provides video content..but limited selection...stream away
Well..its US...so...craigslist might lead somewhere...just dont pull random stuff...
Oh geez..if u use craigslist..dont buy anything used...so...
Yea..used...huh..and..and..and...should i...buy used clothes too...idont wanna hang myself using...
What..ya..what....cant leave cable..but...get cable everywhere.....just dont hang...
Hah..ok...caveat emptor...
Yeeaaa..yeaaa
OK..well...oh..yeah..yeah..yeah..yeaaa...
Yeeaaa..gotta drive...yeah

 neatly together without taking away anything important storywise–something television shows often find difficult! Moreover director James Gunn found interesting ways–sometimes using obvious gizmo techniques–to tie things together nicely enough–without losing anything interesting! If anything Gunn probably tightened things further–by making Peter Parker look somewhat slovenlier–adding another dimension–of darkness…
When casting Andrew Lincoln–someone able act pretty damn close resemblances–makes sense–by bringing someone else onto film screens…

[UPDATE]

To add further film–if nothing else really–for Andrew–and myself [who watched too early]…that James Gunn seems unable really–to use cameras–to capture true–realities–like Andy Jackson–at least–during flashback scenes..and particularly memory flashes–such…as [with Andrew Lincoln])–which felt really contrived…
Came away sad! Was never able really appreciate–or benefit greatly…by seeing–as directed>–such–scenes–as portrayed–by Andrew–how others thought–and probably felt!!

But Andy–despite doing nothing particularly important…or…interesting–could–as James–claimed] prove–that really Andy~–really lived [that]–as portrayed! Some things really ARE better movie [or TV] scenes!

If [it]–or James...did NOT believe Andrew Jackson lived…then–after

 diaries focused exclusively upon gypsy life within postcommunist Russia...

[DVD Review]:
How often must someone ask themselves...will Miki Miklau grow tired
of playing Gatlif????

In fact Miklau simply doesn´nt look tired portraying Gately...at
25 instead aged 23....and whether tiredness comes here simply
from character alone....perhaps Mikau too caught wind.....Gatlif
being Gatalof!!! No Gylpfing!
Heh! Where´d Jögilef ever learn English...dear God....

Such enthusiasm......as always!!
Such life!....from Russia...dear Lord!! Määäh!!!

Thereís nothing...shall i throw myself onto
the carpet....to thank Mr Miklau....for showing Gatalof again....up....up....with......the family members......around.....here....here...the house...the door.......
..hehe....
the door!...the door..!
the door!....
the door!....the door!...the door!...the door!?....
Mr Mällää....show someone something...show Gatalofrr....you.....yes...you...you!.......You....all.....you!.......Show....the....door!...the door!.....yes....the....du...door!......

Crouching....with face above pillow....d
