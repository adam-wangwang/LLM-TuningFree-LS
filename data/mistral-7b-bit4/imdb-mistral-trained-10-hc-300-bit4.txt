such. I found the storyline to the movie a bit boring. I have also watched other movies about people dealing with the fact that they have not really achieved what they were supposed to have achieved in this world and that they are going through a serious mid- life crisis, and those movies have always made a lot lot sense to my life and my friends. But this movie made absolutely NO SENSE to me. I mean it is supposed to make me cry or at the very least make a few sniffle but it was so far from doing so. I didn;’ think it was even remotely funny and I had a lot to be laughing about. Maybe I just am not the typical chick that this kind movie is supposed to work in, but I do not think it. I think the storyline is just too far from reality. I will not be watching a Meryl Streep flick for a loooooooong while, that I tell ya! LOL! Maybe I should go and watch the Devils weare here. Now there were a few good lines from Evening that I remember and I am going o repeat it. Maybe I can even use these quotes in my speech for my brother’ in-laws wedding (I am the MC at this event). This is what I am going o quote;- “Everyone has a story” and the story of Ann Graves (which I am going to relate as a story of a woman who is going
an 8mm film camera makes the cinemetography all together more impressive. The shots were carefully chosen and are very impressive, especially during some of the action shots, which are really well done and really make me want this on blueray. One of the things this film has, is a certain grittness to it, which is a very nice thing, as it adds a certain sense realisum to it. One thing you really need to do if watching the film it to watch the commentary, it really adds to the experience by telling you a lot that you would otherwise not realize about the production. The storyline was a bit strange in places, and some of these strange ideas were really strange, but they didn’t hog it down and it was nice to have things be more original for once, and it was really cool to see something I have never seen. The soundtrack for this was very fitting, and I liked a good number the tracks. It added a lot, especially to the action sequences as it was nice to get the adrelin going by having a good track playing. The acting was pretty ok too, and there weren’ts a bad character in it, the only bad actor I think would have to be Michael Shannon, but that is mainly because he is a badass in real life, so in this it seems weird to see a more normal character. There was one actor (who is not credted, I think I saw
does NOT disappoint!! From the first minute you are thrust into a world that is dark, grung, and dangerous. The game plays much like a traditional R.P G game with an inventory, crafted items and skill based combat, as you battle your way through various quests. The game feels much more polished that it did in Cracker 2, but still maintians a certain level or quirks and bugs that make it feel like a Cracker game. The game is HARD, and I am only about halfway through the game, the combat is difficult, the enemies are strong and fast. The game is dark, with a grungy feel that reminds of the early TES games and even a little bit of the old Fallouts. I highly enjoyed this game and I can's recommend enough to anyone that is a big r.p. g game fan. I am really looking forward too the next game in this epic franchise. Thank you sooooo very very  much for this game. I have really really really enjoyed playing this game. Thank you again. I give this a 14 out 5. (15/5) if I had to choose. ;) ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------- This Is A Must Buy Game ------------------------------- ( I am not affiliated with the game or the developer in anyway).

England, a woman is stalking the town. She brutally murthers the town’stwo main prostitution providers in a seriesof very brutal murthers. The main character is one who is looking to expose the killers in the town, a young girl with an attitude, and it seems this murderer has the hots after our main protagonist, and this could spell doom if she ever goes out alone. It is an entertaining, gore filled film to say the least. It is worth checking this film. It is not perfect but it is entertaining. The film is not as bloody and brutal and gore filled of Fulc’s future work in his filmography, but it still holds a lot of that grue we have all grown to know and love with Italian cinema. As far as Fuls goes, this film ranks high. I recommend this one. If you are a Lucio Fulcin, I think this is worth a look. It is worth watching a few times. 7/7/02 4 out of a 4 star rating from this reviewer. I will have to admit, I was a little disappointed it wasn;’ t a bit more brutal than it was. It had its moments, but it was missing those over the tope gore moments of later Fuls work, I would have liked the ending better as more of a brutal ending, but as far as the rest, its a good film,
Newton or the movie and have no problem calling him God. If you are a believers it would be a different thing however it is a different matter for non believeers. I would like to see a thread that discuss the pros & Cons of calling the movie Newton God. The movie is a piece of work, the acting is amazing and the story so far reaching it is hard to believe there is a movie like this in Indian cinema, the movie is the first of such magnitude. Newton is a great director and I would definitely watch more movies by this team. As for the name of Newton God let us have an interesting discussion. Thanks !!!! Regards, Myself.

musicals seem to want to be serious dramatizations of real-life events, the "Nashville Christmas Carol" special is just a goopy holiday story. The only people to try to elevated this beyond its inherent lowbowness were the performes, who tried with a straight face to turn the material, which was mostly forgettable, at least in my head, into something better. It didn' t happen. It should have been just as chesse as the 87th Avenue South specials, or at best as a "Dukes Christmas Special." It didn t work though. It' s an enjoyable watch if you' re not looking too close, but I have to give a lower rating just for the way the film tries to make it something it's not, and because of that it falls way below what could or possibly sould' t. The film was a bit too slow- paced and the ending seemed too abrupt. There wasn't enough to the story, but the acting was excellent for the most, and it' ll do for a fun Christmas special, even though its far from a classic. This show is a Christmas special in the tradition of the "A Christmas Carol". The show is a bit slow, but it' s not the worst. The best thing I can give the film are the actors, who gave it there best effort. I' ve seen a fair share oif Christmas specials,
tonight. It must’ve felt like a major bummer. I know I’ve been there. I’m so lucky in my current life that I don’t even need cinema tickets to know when life is unfair, but that doesn’ t make it any less painful to see people in such pain. My heart is with you all tonight, and I’d like to think I would’nt be so much of a prick to be writing this post if the shoe was on the other foot, although, you know…it’s just the world’ s way at the end of all of this…..and I really have been there, so…..it’ d only be right. (I’m not really sorry, but you are all welcome to think I am.) And to think that just three days earlier I was in that exact place, and now we’ re in lockdown 3 and I’ m sitting here in front of a big screen with no one around me to distract me. And now I have an abundance, an overabudance of things I want to do, and there’ s no way to do them. I know I could do them, but I have to have my laptop at hand all of the time now. I’m not just going back to the beginning of the year when I was working from my computer all of the time, I now actually have to be there in front of it, because of the nature
best, but for the "Pink Panther" movies (or rather, movies starring Inspector Clouseau) they started with the most mediore film of the lot "A Shot in The Dark".  The series of "pun"-related titles is a bit of a joke by itself, with "The Son Of Inspector Cloussean, The Curse Of The Clousesean Womban, The Pink Panter Strikes Again" and so forth. The "Pink Pant" is some pink jewel thief, who stole the diamond (called "The Blue Panter"), but has been killed by some mafiaso (and it turns to be, that the Clousean was the real murder. So Inspector Clousean (Peter Sellers), gets the job to investigate the case of his own death, which brings the movie to a point, that's so ridiculous, that is must not only make any kind sense in a story-telling context but also be utterly stupid. The movie is fun, but not funny. 5/10. Oh, and if anyone can tell me a single reason why Peter Sellers is such an iconic movie character in Britain and America, when he is completely unknown in Germany, France and Italy, please let'me  kno. (I dono know a single person in any European city, that ever heard of him, apart of the few

I was really interested in that show but had heard a few things and was hesitate... I am now going to check that show and the new "Dirt". I am just getting around to watching the last season and this season for Dirt on NX-TV. So what do you think? Worth it? Did not like it? Is FX going in a new and interesting direction? Let me know.

persevernated through a series of films like THE WIND, THE DREAMERS, DANGER GODDESS, THE MAN WITH A GIRL NEXT DOOR, WILD IN SADNESS, LADY FROM TOKOGO, THE FACE SHOWN TO THE WIND, THE TERROR OF DR. HADRA and THE SONS. The series is not only well done in terms of quality, the stories were compelling and the filmmakers and stars were clearly passionate, but they also have some very strong, very interesting, very sexy heroines at the heart of them who were not afraid and didn’t care what the men thought of their behavior. They made their way in the tough world of their time and place, and they got things they wanted and were not afraid or ashamed of what that entails in terms of sexuality. The final entry is TEP, and while there was plenty to like, it just didn´t live uo the promise and passion of its forebear. The heroine is an exotic, independent woman who falls prey to a mysterious man who wants to take and own her. She has been in a long-distance affair, but now she is back home with her family, and that is where it all begins. It does not end happily or well, and I think there is nothing much I can say that will do it justice or be an accurate summition of what I
the leader and to keep the peace. The current leader is being attacked by rivals, but he has a plan. To use the gangs to attack them. The leader is a ruthlessly efficient killer, using his enemies to make his way, so we don's really feel bad for him. He has two rivals. One a very nasty one who we'd like to seen lose. The second is a good man who would be good for the people. This is a violent film, it really isn'y for everyone as there is a high body-count. That makes it hard to care about the people we are following around, they are just numbers. I was not really impressed, but that does'nt make it a terrible film, it just is not something I want or can rewatch. Its interesting to think about what happened to the good guy, but that's all. I give it a rating of OK (6/7) with a warning that there is a lot of very violent violence in the film. If you don' have any issues with that, then you may get more out if the story. It was filme dby Johnnie Tan, and starring Louis Koon, Ling Bai, Ting Lung, Man-Tai Chan and Chow Sang. 2019, R, 6/4/8 3340119087457.
particularly if we are going to see them on campus. And this film is a lot like the campus it was shot on--an amiable mishmash. It's about a Harvard professor (Michael Cain), his students and his students' lives. The professor, for one of his classes in the spring quarter, takes the class to England on an intrepid journey which turns out not to go at all smoothly, but it'ssupposedto, so everyone'slastnerves. The professor is having problems at the front. His father has committed suicide. His wife is pregnant with twins (she had a mis- carry last year), and she is not feeling at her best. He is not feeling his best either. And, of course, the students have their own lives and their own problems which they are trying desperately notto tell the prof. about--but then who has the right and the time for that kind of thing, anyway... Brownof Harvard is a little too much to take in all the time. The characters are not developed to a level of interest. We have been spoil ed for good movies in the last few months: The Deerstalked Jack- rabbit, The Man Who Fought City Hall, Avalan- che. These movies, as you know, are not about Harvard or any other college. They are good because of their good acting and good storyteling. Brown of Harvard is not a bad
Wave directors’ films of the 60’es that have achieved some sort or recognition, like Chantal Akermans La nena, Godard’es Masques. But it has also slipped through the net of the Cahiers critics who were the ones that made the Nouvelle Vague famous and the critics who had a huge impact in the film business. It is a shame because this film is in many ways much more interesting and has a wider appeal. It is a shame because it is the one film where Rohmer really shows himself as a film writer. He is not just writing a script with a beginning middle end with characters, but also a text, a piece of literature with a beginning middle and an end. And in his writing of a story he manoeuves his words, his sentences in a way that has a rhythm of its own as a musical composition. This film is a very musical piece where the soundtrack is an integral element of the film’ s composition, not as a separeter element. It seems like an element that the film has been built around and that all images, words and sounds are intertwined to create a very organic form in the film. It has not been made to tell the same kind of stories or the style of the other members if the New Wavel. It is not a ‘reviveur de l’image’, not even an ‘enfante terrible’. But a very mature piece by a
cleared my Sunday for the showing of the movie at the malled in Greenhils, Ortigus. I was expecting something from the likes of Kung-fu, or a new kind of action genre. The first 15 mts of action was promising and I was looking forward for something big. Well. that was not so! It was a typical love story that turned out into an action flick where most parts is like a soap-opra, or a telenyola (Filipino movie for young ones). The story was not so impressive, but at least some of the fight choroggraphy is great. It has its best parts in the second half, where a lot of fight action took placed. I would recommend it for a Sunday show, but not to watch at home. You might want to skip a few parts, but not the action ones! I give this 2 out for the 5. I think it deserves more. Just because it had a lot more better fight choreograpy and the action is great, but that is not enough to make it a movie. For action, go for the Matrix or the Blades! If you want to watch this film for the first half and the last half hour, you will not be disappointed by the rest of the movie. For the complete action experience watch the Matrix triloy. It has better action, better story, and a better movie to watch! 7 out of

how everyone is poor and downtrodded; it would be nice for a once in while to have an up-to-standard British film that makes you feel good about British life. This film does a good enough of a decent job of doing that. It isn’’ not amazing but it’ not terrible. The acting can be a bit too dramatic for your liking as it is a film about a small group who are being hunted down by a gang of baddys, but it is entertaining enough to keep the audience gripped throughout the film. It is very predictable with the typical British film twilights with no real shocking twits to give any surpriseful elements, it is just a film about a normal British family who are trying to escape a baddie. It’ll keep all ages entertained, although you can probably guess the ending. But if you are looking for just a good British family film that doesn not involve any fantasy or animation then I would give this a go. It has some good humoured moments with the children and some funny moments with their father and a bit of love story going throughout. Overall is probably not going do anything for the british film industry, but it is worth seeing in my opinion if not for a few good laugh and to see if anything British is worth a go. It certainly has some potential and with a budget of only $ 14 million (according the internet) I’’ d
film. It was so bad that a friend of mine, a movie buff who’d seen everything from THE WICKER MAN and THE HORSE WHIPPING MARI to THE DEVIL RIED FOX, had to stop watching halfway through. It’s bad enough that it’s a very, very, silly and unfun movie and that the actors are all bad, but worse than all of these is the fact that the plot makes NO SENSE AT ALL AND NOBORU IFU-JI DOUBTED I’D UNDERSTAD. In fact it is one big nonsene, so nonsensical that even the director, who apparently didn’t know how to do anything to make any sense, couldn’ t follow. I am not sure who is the one who directed the film, but if you look at it, the film is very poorly directed. For instance it seems as if he doesn’t have any concept about how to shoot a scene. He has no knowledge of how light or the background would affect the picture. The scene in which the main characters are trying their luck in a casino is shot in such an amateurish fashion that I am not surprised that he would use such amateur-ish techniques in the film itself. The film is such a mess that you are forced, by its own lackluster, to try to understand why. I am sure the director was hoping people would find
to tears. It was about the first time i was ever truly afraid. It’d been about three years ago. i’ve watched it a few times since but it’s not as scary. I was watching the movie alone. I wasn’t sure if it would be scary. But after the scene where they first meet at his house, i started to get nervous… It was the scene where he goes out to feed her a piece, and she goes for his hand. Then she goes for his neck. Then they were running for their life. i was like, “O… My…. GOOOOOOOD!!!”… i didn-n’tt know when the movie was going. I had the remote control on hand ready to turn the TV on. At the time, it didn seem like they were going to die. I was hoping he would kill it with the baseball bat. So he’d hit it in head, i thought he’ll hit it in the heart, and i thought he would’ kill it. But no, it got ahold of him, and it was like watching a movie of a sharks attack. I was like “Oh my God…” It kept sunk its fangs and was going to eat him, i thought it was going for his heart. But it missed. i thought to my self “Nooooo!!!! It’s going to get away…” Then he was on it. Then in the end,
aka pirates are played with enthusiasm by a youth cast. But the plot is slow moving and it never achievies any sense that the youngsters are ever really at risk. This is not a film designed to be watched by youngsters, however. It contains some fairly brutal pirate violence and a scene of childbearing. The music score is excellent, however it is a very minor musical. It is a bit too long and too plagiarism-proned, although it has some cleverly designed sets. It is not a film which will be remembered but a watchable period film that will give you a pleasant way of spending a couple of hours in a pleasant way if you like musical piracy stories which are not overburdensome. The best of the songs were cut. The film has a nostalgia look which is appealing. But it is not a great classic or a film with an engaging plot. In the original Odysseus story, the plot was more compelling, and it is the one which was not plagerized. This is not a great musical but it has a certain nostaligic charm, especially if you remember it from your youth, and it has a certain nostelgia charm for period fans of this story. The music was good. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon if nothing else is available. Not a great classic but a decent piraccy musical. It is not the best version of the story,
run off of the block type of chick shes very different in my personal opinion i like it. The acting in my opnion was great and it is a story that you can really relate to. I like the fact he did this to his dad i think everyone who have parents who were abusive to you when you was growing would have done that to there parents. Its like you see in real life where kids kill their abusive mother or fathers or both of there abusing parents its kindve of sad to see this happen but its the truth. So if your bored and need a movie to watch i would recommend it. Thats a personal opinion of mine thanks for reading. Peace out bitches!!!!! LOL! JK! LMAO! Hahha! Lol.! I think you get that point. Lol!!! Hahha! Hahha!!! Peace bitchez! lol! Lol!!! Peace! lol! Lol! :p lol!!! Hmmmm lol. Lol! HAHAHAHAHAHA. Hahahaha! Hahha. Hahah. Hah. Haha! lol! Lol. Haha. lol. Ha. Hmmm. Lol!!! HAAA! Haha! Lol!

the carton they were trying not only to teach children about the value but also of the dilemmias of being a millionaire in a capitalistic society. In this live-version the producers have lost the message. The only message I can tell was “Buy stuff”!. And it’ll cost you to do even less of an effort than what you do in order to get a lot in the cartoon!. I think it was a waste of a good idea of a plot. I’m not against capitalism, but it’s a little unfair to teach children this type of values… I’ve heard some say this is better than the original cartoon. I disagree. But, if I had seen this movie in my childhood (or even as a teen) I would have enjoyed more than I did now. The cartoon was better. 4/5 if you have no childhood nostaglas, and/or no kids to enjoy the movie and 3.33 for the rest… 🙂 (btw, if I see a movie for free, you won´ t see a rating less than three!) 😛 It might be fun to see the whole cast (even the little ones) playing in a movie for grown-up… but it’s not! If you have children to see this, please do, but don’t expect anything else than the “Honey, we’re rich now! Let´s buy stuff
reading it but I have decided not too as I don;t know what might happen in the plot which might make me feel sick and sad again .....I am so sad about this ..... it' s so unfair on the fans .....and I am not going to waste my valuable reading time on this . I will read this when or if it is re-written. So unfair ... ...... and the author was asked several months ago why he chose to not to go with what was in the books ?... he said he was just being creative ... I think I will just stick with the original books and ignore this one. I don;t know why they had too many different ideas about this ... I am also really sad and unhappy about this too . I think I would like to read the original trilogy before I read this one . I was so looking frowards too reading this but I am not now . I am also really sad too. ....I am so sad too and unhappy......so so sad about not being able and wanting too read this ... I am very very sad too....... ............. I am very sad and unhappy about not reading too. ......and also very sad about not being able to read the book. ......

of crap 1 star needs therapy and anyone who did not rate it has no taste what so ever.This movie was so bad that it'll put you down to the point where you'll feel suicidal. The acting was pathetic. The music was annoying and I think it was made with only 1 or possibly no sound engineers (that'd be why the sound was so crap). The script was so bad. I would not recommend any one, no even people who are dying for a laugh see this movie and even then, it's still not worth it. The only positive thing I can give the movie is the ending which was ok. The end credits were pretty funny though. The film is so pointelessly bad and should of been banned, it'll put you into a horrible depression. This movie is such an insult too cinema that I'm giving this movie a big zero, I would give it a negative zero, if I could. It was so awful. It' not even funny or entertaining. It's just a piece on pure junk, that shouldn;t even exist and I feel sorry too the people who paid to watch this movie, I wouldn't wish such an awful film on my worst enemy. This movie is so atonishingly horrible and should be avoided, if I could, I'll be making a campaign for this movie being banned. Don;' be fool, don';' see the movie "D
doesn' t want Mary, his wife, getting any ideas. So he tries to hide the fact he's got a lottery ticket but she still managesto find it and gets excited. When she finds the ticket, the scene is hilarously played. The only funny parts in this short (in which she also is in some scenes with him) are with her so it'd have been interesting to have her in the story all the while. I was surprised she had a scene in this one with him. I guess that means Mary didn''t have to be in all of them. I also enjoyed the scene where Joe tells Mary about the prize he won. That' s where Joe and Mary are in their bed in pjs and the scene is quite interesting. I like the ending scene of Joe and his friend in their pajama bottoms and slipper socks. I can' t believe it, but this short was actually funny. It's the only one of Joe McDoake''s shorts which was. I guess this short was made after "Joe McD. Meets his Inlaws", so it's no wonder the short was better in terms of comedy. I'm still not that sure of the name of this one though because on YouTube.Com, it was labeled as "Joe Mc Doakes-The Squeeze is On". But the scene in the back of their car when Joe McD. is trying
actors, because they could not have known what they were letting themselves into, when the script is so bad! So many times I was thinking, oh no they're doing that again! And, of course there is that horrible, horrible ending (or what passes as one). The story just doesnâ� 't hang together, the characters are so clich� and there is nothing, or barely anything new to make one want to continue watching the movie. What a waste! The only reason this was made into a film is because of its source material. I know that it was meant to appeal particularly to the teen market, with a little humour and lots of guts, but it was so much better than this! What a shame! I really liked the first three books; the fourth was quite a letdown too though it was better than its film adaptation. I can'â� â ¢t recommend it in the slightest. Donâ ®t bother. Youâ� ™l lose a few hours that could be put to far greater use! A waste all 'round, I would say! I have to say that I'â• m disappointed in this one! I have no idea why it was even made at all! What a waste for the actors, the script writer (although, to tell the Truth I would have thought that the book would have a much more faithful adaptation) or the producers. What were they
eulogy about it either. I think this one is a little lost at sea, and it'll be interesting seeing how it'l fare, I mean how do these things go to market? Does it go to the arthouse? To festivals? Does anyone care about it'd success? If the director had made this as a 20minute short, it would probably work really well, and I guess that might'v worked as a pilot for the series, because that's what's it's really about. I found the pacing a little too slow, and I'm not so enamoured with that sort of look, so if they were going to make this as feature length they need some big names to make this interesting. It'll probably be interesting seeing some people's reaction when they watch it though, it does have that sort'f "in" feel, and it might just have to settle there, but then the director isn't in that place yet, and I'm not sure if the story is as well fleshed out as the filmmaker would need it'v for a feature. I'd be interested to see if he does make more films in this sort've style, it looks nice enough, but I'm just not that interested in seeing this again. A lot'v the ideas are good and I think this could be a really good film, but I don;t
film. and i was actually able to understand most of the dialogue and that doesn't always fly with sub titles. the main characters are great, the supporting cast is great and even the minor side characters have more depth than what i usually find at a movie theater. also, the director does a good job of balacing both humor with the drama. i can' see this winning awards but this movie was worth the price of ticket and the pop corn and i've seen worse on cable. i'm glad i was able see this movie in the darkened theater and not in the day light of the television or i've never seen this movie before. the story is a good balance of humor with drama, the dialogue, while at first off puting, grows on you. if a movie can be both funny with serious moments and not just a comedy or a drama then i call that an accomplisment and this one is just as much a comedy as any other movie but with more heart and depth. the ending is a bit unfulfilling in the end though. i can see why some people might think this is a clicke movie but i don' think it's that bad. also, the supporting cast is great as are the other minor characters. if you've got a date night coming up then this is a good flick to see but not a date movie. if you'e alone though you might not get anything from it though unless your looking
so awful that i could only laugh. And what was the plot? I don; know, but it must have been bad to make the whole movie. The ending was so ridiculous, that i was laughing out loud. This film is just a joke. If it weren ' t for the fact that i really like the movie "The Last Broadcast," i would not have given this movie a comment. Don't waste you time and money on this film!! It was only for the fun of laughing.. :-) 2 stars because of some good shots.. 2.1 stars, but i am giving it 2.1, because the movie "The Last Broadcast" is so good. 2/5 23/5 (c)*23455569.

initial trailer is a complete lie. In this case it promised a lot but failed horrifically. This movie is one big disappointment. It is the kind of film that has you wish you could take back the time you wasted watching it. It is so painstakenly obvious they had no idea where to take the story. It starts, goes nowhere, comes around, goes nowhere again, and then ends. It is completely predictive, boring, and stupidly plotted. The dialogue seems like a poor attempt at trying to be clever and humorous, but falls flat due to the lack of actual wit and intelligence. The acting was at best, mediocre. This movie had all the signs for being a huge success and ended failing miserably. I wouldn't recommend watching any films with either of these actors in it ever. The only good part of the movie were the explosives. If that's the best thing about the film then you might want to pass on seeing it. There are so many other better films than this one to choose. Just skip it and watch something that is fun or at the very least, entertaining. This movie fails at both. </font>(r64) (29/101) 55%(r#63)<font size=4>"The most amazing thing is that these four guys actually think they're the greatest thing to ever hit the silver (or small) Screen."
movie because it was too long, or boring, or a lot to do, and then went on and wrote a bad review because they walked out. So here I am, watching this movie in full, all 161 of them. So let’ get into it, and see what I think of it! I hope to God they made a better movie then The Last AirBender, because the first one was so bad. I will start with one of the things I noticed while watching Avatar the movie, which I will now refer to as The Last Air Bander, and that is that there is a lot of talking with little action. And when there are action scenes, they are over quickly. The movie is also a little dark in the beginning and in some scenes later on. It has a lot going on, and I think they need more action because this movie is too slow! But the movie is actually not that good, it is only good if you like action movies! I think they should make an action movie about a group of people that fight to save the last air benders. They should not have made the second movie, and the first should have been their main focus because the second is way too long and they do too much! And the first movie is better if they do make the third and final one. But I still have to wait on that for another year. The second movie is good, I enjoyed a lot of the action scenes but I wish
sense, and it is quite a long movie, so this is not one of those movies you sit and watch with your family during the holidays or when you want to spend a relaxing time with friends or loved ones. This film has all of the qualities that are essential to any movie of art that you would expect it to have. It is beautifully made with a lot attention for detail, it has a really good story with a lot of twits and a lot of suspese, it has all kinds off characters, some funny, others scary, it has some interesting scenes that are really worth seeing, and I could go on and on about this great movie. I would say that this film has all of those qualities, and it is also very good for people who do have a little bit of a knowledge in the arts. In fact, I think that this film would even work if one is a little familiar with "classis film". So, if I were a director I think I would have been really proud with this movie. It't just a great movie to watch with your lovedones, it'is not a movie that people just watch because they want to get drunk or they want some sex, it's not a cheap, boring movie. A movie for art lovers. 🙂 I think that it is a great movie for art and that I am sure I'll be seeing again. 10/5 stars for this one 😉 (And for those people who

itself isn' t meant for a serious audience, it' s meant to mock. If I was the kind of person, who took everything seriously and thought that this might just be a real story, well, I would probably commit suicide, as I would be a complete idiot. You know, you can' t take everything seriously, so this movie is really good for those who take everything for a joke - but it' s not so good if your head is full, because the storyline may be a bit too complex for an audience that thinks. I' m not sure if the storyline of this flick was intended, or not, but it' s really good, and it makes me wonder how it might have been possible for this movie to get made in first-rate style back 25 years ago... But, in any way this movie is really good. The storyline is really well-written, and the characters are well portayed. This storyline is really funny, and it' s really good for those who like to make fun. It really shows that there is no real storyline that would not get this kind, or a similar kind of parody. In conclusion, this flick really is a parody. The whole thing is just a parody, but it's also a good one - and I' d say that I' d watch the movie again, if I had the chance. It' s great, and it has really good characters
’ The Overnighters. The movie was released on VHS on 13 Nov of this year. It was a very good film, but I had some problems with my player. Anyway, the film is about a group of strangers who are on vacation in Norway. The first half of the story is very interesting, because the story unfolds around the main character, which we have not met before in any film, and his relationship to a woman who is his ex-girl-fiend. I think that the film is very entertaining to the people that want to see a movie with good acting performances and some great story. The movie has been released on DVD with subtitles. I recommend this movie to anyone! The movie is about 13 minutes long and has a very short running time, but it is so well-done and the acting is great. The story line is very interesting, the acting is very strong and the movie is worth watching, even for people who want to see a good comedy, drama or horror film, this movie is great. I recommend this movie for anyone! The film is a great piece for a good movie night. I think that it is a must-have for the collection or just to watch for a good time. I would like to thank the movie mavic, the DVD distributor and the film makar for the film. If you have any comments on my review about ‘The Last of Us‘, please feel free
) that she used to bring. She was one of the most beautiful people alive, had a fantastic career in both film and TV (most notably the 10, 1981), is a good actress and is very intelligent. Her first husband was John Corbisiero, an Italian-American business tycoon, who was a real catch - handsome, extremely rich with a beautiful, class act daughter from his first marriage. They had two children and divorced amiabaly but the marriage didn’t work out, which is hardly a surprise as Derek is one woman who likes control in her relationships. She also had a long term relationship with Billy Conolly and has been married a second time to another very rich man - this one a property tycooon. She has also had to deal and survive, the tragedy in her life. When she was only a child she lost both parents and her brother as a result of the 1968 plane crash - the same as which killed the singer Budday Knox. Daughter of Russian immigrants she was named Nastasia after Pushkin’ s character in his novel "Evengi Onegin". As a teenager Nastasia was an international model. Her big acting break was when she starring in the hit TV show "The Windsor". Bo’s biggest film success was in "10" with a cameo appearance in another big hit - Tarzan the Apeman. I
long, so I'm gonna have the summary say only a few words about each event rather then have a detailed story. Here're the events: I'm only going to write about the first four because I'am getting really tired, and because I think four sounds reasonable : ) The first one was at the beach, with a little bit of the ocean around it and a cliff. Next, was the second, which takes a long long time until you get to it, in a huge forest with some houses here or their. And then there was this event in a town, with some stores that I haven't found yet. Then, there the was event at the mountain side, and then it'd be at a huge forest, then I've only been to it once, so the description is really not good. And finally I was in the town near the forest, where the people are really rich. I think that's it. But I could have forgot, and I may add more later. I'm pretty sure I forgot some : p But anyway here is some pictures! :) (sorr the pictures are kinda blurry, I had to put down my camera while the pictures where being taken : x And also I'e only got some of them. There is more but I don's feel like putting in the rest xD ) Oh, and this is the best one of the whole thing :) The last one, at the huge
unless you also grew up during The Greatest Generation/Ken Burns era. But, as a movie...I think it's really, really well craft. And it makes it's point with great subtlely. The film'makes fun'of the 9/11 tragedy but never does to the extent of being offensive. I think it'sevident that they'rewhether or knot the characters are fictional in the same way the characters in the Wizard of Oz or Alice'sn'in Wonder are ficttional: they'reliving a story that'stheir own but the way they live that'sspecifically for the movie audience so that we can see the story. I like the way they use the camera angles, lighting, and costumtures. The camera angles especially are amazing - they're very subtle and I'remade to be in a lot of shots where it'stt's just obvious to see what's going on, but they'rre're also subtle enough where they're not distracting at al, and they're really good at using lighting and costu,tures to show us what'stt happening and not just for the purpose t't't't be funny. I also like that's the story is based on realt't't'd'd's. The story is pretty good. I
at a wide audience, but it never comes close, because it has a tone to its storytelling that is so out-there that you can’t help but notice it’s a little off. There is an attempt made to make something funny, which might be a bit too subtle for younger kids, too much of the wrong thing for adults and even the older teens. It’d probably best for kids around 10-25? It doesn’ t really work for me and I’d say it is best left for kids of 12+, if there even is a target audience for films with such a specific tone! It’ll make more sense if you see for yourself and decide for yourself what it is you are getting out. There is a little bit for everybody! 5/2 stars! It’ll grow and grow on you! If you see enough times, you might start to see something! It’s a real trip! 101minutes. R. 3,5/5. Recommended but hard-to-sit. If only it was made more accessible. 3/10. 1/2 star! 50%. Not recommended at this time. 12/1 stars 101/159 stars 4.25 stars 1/4 stars 101 stars! 1/10 2/4 stars 15
attention of his supervisor to get him and his partner the time off they need so they won’ have a problem with their child custody agreement. His supervisor refuses, so he decides he’ll have take off time or quit. His partner and he take off for a trip to the mountains. While driving, they get into a car chase. The chase is led down a wondorous trail to find the car thief. The chase is led into the woods where they have to stop to fix the car after a log gets stuck in front of the tire and breaks them. After stopping to make repairs, the two detectes discover that their captor is on foot. They set the dogs on him but he runs up and attacks one of the police dog’ handlers and bites him. The chase ends after the two catch the culpriut. After the chase, they find out that the guy’ s car thief is a woman, who had escaped from a mental institution. Dutch had to give the dogs to another officer as he had just adopted them. The rest is a chase with an insane woman, the dogs, the police and an old man who thinks he’s a bear. Dutch has some problems with being a dog owner. He has to find a sit for the day for the dogs, and has to go to the vet for the dog when he gets sick and needs to be checked out. The movie was great and had some funny lines. It
character portrays, so in a few words, they made a bad film.  For one of their first films I was hopeful of something good and was really expecting it to be one of their best films. It failed to live up to those standards I’ve set as a fan of horror, and I am very disappointed. It had many of the things I disliking about horror movies – predictability (as you can see a trailer for this film and predict everything), jump-scares used as the main part and they are always stupid. I hate movies with jumpy characters – I don‘e find them scary; I find them irritable. And this movie is full to the brim with them and they‘re used in the wrong way – it is all done so you’re just waiting to see when it jolts you and it’d be more scary if they used some suspence. This movie isn’ have any suspense whatsoever. I found a lot the actors were irritation – mainly the girl in the beginning but it gets better when the main girl enters the story. I found she was okay as she was a strong, independent girl who didn let her fear take control. But I feel the characters weren really developed well so there were some who had good traits and some bad which just made them hard too relate to and some were just annoying. The storyline is good to start with but it gets lost and I felt it just
action centres around the American embassy, the embassy of one unidentifiable European country, a nearby nightspot, a nearby restaurant (within earshot) and the apartment building of the hero. This is not a spy story or a James Bond tale; it’a a tale of political and diplomat intriguing. The hero has the power to influence world events and the villain wants him out and a new man in. I think the hero is a CIA Agent. I think the main villain works with the Soviets. That is all. I do think it is worth seeing once, just for the laughs, but that would be it for any viewings. The film has been described as a comedy; I do not see it at all. It is not a comedy. I found it quite dull to be honest. I can only think of one funny moment (at least I laughed out loud) and this involves an attempted assassinations, a car door and some blood. A few others might have smiled but that is probably it as for laugh out loads funny. This is one where I would not bother. A big waste of a good plot and a good idea. 3 out of 11 (for the laugh out load moment) if it was up to one out ten. (Average) 3/10/1999. 3 out of ten. I saw the film again. It is still a waste of film
Lord of The Rings, rather than Hobbit, or the Silmarillion, or the Children of Huran, or whatever other book that I am not aware exists as of yet, but I know that the Hobbits, Elf, Men, Orks, Dwarf, Golems and all the other creatures that inhabit the land that is The Shire, Middle-Eart, and all the rest of it are the main character’ so let us start. I am also a huge gamer so I will have to include my own opinion as an gamer when it is needed. I am also a bit late to this one, so some might find a bit of repetitive information here but I have tried as much as possible to make it as different as possible. I also know that this is a big book and it will take some more time to complete it. I will add that it is not for the casual reader, but one thing I can be sure about is, that there are a lot more of those who want to read it. So without waiting for any other excuse, here’s the thing: If you are in any doubt about what to read, then just go straight to book 5 because that will be the best one. So here’re my thoughts on the other 4. Lord of… Read more The Hobit – A Tolkeinesque Adventure in Middle-Tolkia Land! Read More »The Hobit - A Tol
movie has a good cast as well. I didn't expect a very good movie, but I didn't expect an all-involved action/adventures movie, but it was more on that side then I'd expected. I don"t like the way the first half of it was going with the "fighting" in a way, but the second-half, and more of it, got better. I've seen Brolin in other movies, and he was very good. I'll give the film credit to how it ended, it was good, very suspenseful, and I liked how it ended up, but I felt like I would've wanted a little more of Broyln, not just him. If you're like me and you don't like watching movies with the first half of it being action, I wouldn's see this movie first. Brolin was great, and the other actors, not so much in the beginning. It did get really bad for me in some spots, the first half of it, when I thought there was too mcuh action and not much of a story. It did pick up and I'd recommend giving it a chance. I like the ending, the last 2/5ths. The beginning was just too much action for me but it is definitely not a bad flick. I liked it. 8.7 out 10 for this
confusing. It seems to me like a good opportunity was missed. The talk would benefit greatly by having less text on it. I would like to have the slides presented at a slower pace, because I had a hard time reading the slides. Also I would like to point out a few mistakes I found: (a) on page two you state the age of the Universe. It is 12 billion (or years). You should probably use a number that has one less digit after it. (B) The first law of thermo-dynamix states that the total volume times the pressure is constant (I believe there was a typo). Also, on page 5 you state that you should be using the metric for a sphere. This is not correct as the metric should be a sphere. On pages six, eight and nine, you refer to a 250, 3.00 and 4-1. I don;t understand what these numbers are referencing but I am assuming you meant to use a 2.5/3. or 4.0/1.0. Thanks for your help. I think that if this slide show is cleaned-out, it will be a lot more interesting. Also, I don?t really know the answer to this question, (page 11). What if you have no mass? I don?T understand how that can be possible. Thank You, Derek L. C. C
gets out, he meets his old partner, Jack Warner (David Niver), who convinces him that he still owns the half the partnership they originally made when they went into business together before they got married and divorces, and that he is entitled to a share of the current profits of their current firm (which is now run by Jack).

it sets a mood and look that isn’ t repeated in this film. The film starts and ends too quickly; we don”t get to feel the isolation and clausterophbic atmosphere at all until the very closing shots of this version. The main problem is that there is no real feeling that this version of THE FOUR ROOMS is trying to do anything new or different from its original inspiration. The only really new thing here are the performances; the first film is a little more over the top with its performances, whereas this version is a bit calmed. There also seems to have less humor in this version compared it its 20 year old predecessors, but that might just be that I remembered the performances from the other version more than this. The first film is definitely the stronger version, but it does have some fun performances from Quentin, Rodrigue, and Tarrentino. The performances for this film, though more low key, are still very well cast and performed. It’s also nice to hear the voice over from Timothy Olsin again (he does the voice overs in the original and the voice of the narrator in the opening and closing sequences of this film) as his voice has such the unique voice over tone that he’ll always have me curious who he’ ll show in any project that I hear him in. The first film is a classic and this is a remake with some very talented film makers, so it
, one hopes for better. There is one moment of genius (the bank hold-out) but it just doesn't add up. The film't opening scene promises so very much indeed (the 'siege' of a car with a police officer, an armed robber and his pregnant wife), but is then never fully capitalised. The film feels over-written in places, too many scenes of conversation with too many characters. As a result not enough is revealed about each major player. The robbery itself feels a tedious anti- climaxis (too many shots showing us what we can't see). There's too much violence without any just cause. The 'bromance' story-line feels too contrived. There'd be no problem in believing that this could be a film that could be made on a much smaller budget, but not by a top studio with a big budget at its disposal (although maybe they felt that with a director of this statute they just needed the script and the cast). As a result we don' t get a film with 'edge' (which is what I was hoping to see). The ending is very contorted and unbelieveable, with the final scene not just a let-down but a betrayal of what has gone on before and is not belieavably in the spirit of what has come earlier, in my opinion anyway. As I say a big let down. 5 from
sloppily written, full of plot holes, and with a plot that had no clear ending or conclusion, so you are pretty much just left wondering what happened afterwards. The whole storyline of the two characters falling in love is pretty pointess because they are never together except for one scene near the end that was pretty random for no apparent purpose. They both have boyfriends. The storyline of one character being the "villan" is also pointess because he is never punishe for his actions and is inexplicitlly forgivien by all. And finally, the storyline of one of them being pregnant, that is pretty much thrown together at tne end for shock value but is not developed or even finished. You never get to see if the woman gives birth or not because they just sort of cut the scene off at a critical point in the drama for no apparent reason. You are left hanging and that was probably the most dissapoointng part about the movie, but there were many. If you can find a cheap copy of it, I am sure it would be good to watch just for a little bit of fun, but I wouldn' want this movie in my permanent DVD collection just because it' really not worth the money. There are other films that are much more interesting and that have better acting and writing and more interesting plots that are available for a cheaper price, so I wouldn recommend this at this price point (about 16
was a big fan of this genre aswell with a film filled with gory death scene after another. But what I did not like was the fact the film was filled with clichés and not original in any sense. The first scene is a typical slashentering and we’ve all seen a lot of slashenters in movies in which we know the main character will survive, but in fact does die. And in this film a character who was just introduced in a scene before dies, so what’s the point of her character? The main character in the film is an annoying little bitch, aswell a lot off cliches are filled with her storyline and her friends. Another cliché is the fact a lot of the characters are not original and we know exactly what is gonna happen with them. Also the film lacks suspense in which it needed to be a great horror flick. And what was the big suspence moment in which they had to build it to? I did like a lot off the death scenes, they were very detailed. The ending is great and I was glad that it ended the film. Also the ending is the one scene in which the film had some original ideas in. But overall this a very clumsey and stupid film filled with clichés. So if your a fan off this genre you can skip the rental. But I have seen worse so it might just be worth a rental. Also the director had better films
the stories of their exploits the preceding week. They rate the girls on an ascribed scale of attractiveness; the one of the week is then taken out and scored on a scale of 1 to ten for the quality of their performance (the more demeaning and deranging, usually involving public acts of humility, degrading and/or humiliation, and often in the presence and participation of their friends, the higher the score). The highest score at the dinners was 19.4 (for oral sex in a subway bathroom) with 20 being a perfect night. Their escapade of that week is played out for us, in their version. The movie is a satrical look at male/females attitudes, relationships and behavior in a world dominated and run (with varying success, of course, but it's never admitted that it' s less than perfect) for their benefit by men. As such, it'd probably be offensive to most. I've never had a problem in the past with such a thing (I love Mont Python, for God's sake); I guess, though, I just can take things like this in a movie, whereas in real life, I'd want to kill them or beat them to a fine pulpy bloody mass of jelling flesh, bone, muscle, and tissue, but this movie I could sit for. Not because I was entertained, but as a study;

hell (pun completely unintentionally intended!) outta me. But that's what you need...an older brother to take the little sister (me) to go see a movie and be like "come on" in that way that you know you're gonna get a beating when your parents aren&apos;t around. (and you're still scared outta you mind!).   I remember one of my best bud&apos;s in high school was a little weird and I didn&acute;&acute;t know him well enough at the time to figure it all our...and I asked a girl in school about him one day and she told me he was a little weird but was just a little bit of a "witch-hunter"...and I was like "what the hell is that?" and she told me about her dad&acute;&acutes; job in a witch hunting family!<Br/> So yeah, that is what you need for a great horror film, a little fear and a little humor thrown into the right places...and the rest is all about the execution, of which I think this film has in spuds and that&acut&acutese what makes it such a fun film to watch. I mean, sure it ain&acute;t The Excorist and some horror films are a little more scary and realistic but it has to be a little
his famous etching Relativity (1954). This time around, it is not only the city of Paris that is upended. In fact Paris may or may never be. It’ is all an optical illusion – an illusion we have been conditioned, in a sense, not merely in terms our own individual experience of the city of light, that has been the setting of our love and romance and our lives, but also as a result of the countless movies that use Paris and the various images of it as their backdrop. So what we get here are multiple images of Paris that all appear to be happening at one and the sam time but in a sense do not – an optical, temporal and geographic illusion. So we have an apartment on the fourth floor, a bus, the streets, an airborne traffic jam with an endless stream on cars, bicylist and others, and then the rooftops with a man trying, unsuccessfully, for a smoke and a woman sitting on her roof top terrasse, drinking her apero. Then there is the view of the city, the Eiffell Tower and the rest, and a train that has just left the station, and then an apartment with an old fashion woman who is being visited by one young man who has a suit case and a woman who is wearing her hat as a mask to conceal a broken heart, and then there are the lovers who are kissin in Paris and then the lovers who
coming‐out story, an account (in flashback) from the 30'S, and a romance. Its title seems an inappropriate allusion, and the script, though nicely worked, has a rather predictably happy end. Nevertheless the movie is entertaining, and the performances, though not of the first order, are adequate. The principal actors, Susan Clark and Peter Donat are both Canadian, though one could be excused for suspecting that they are American, which could have been an advantage. Susan Clark plays Alice Kerr, an attractive, unselfconscious woman whose marriage is on the rocks. We are given no details about this, but the husband seems a pretty obvious louse. The movie opens with a scene in an upstate NewYork courtroom, as the wife is trying, unsuessfully to obtain a divorce. Alice seems to be in a funky mood, perhaps because she has just been dumped. She is in NewYork because she'd come to town a few days earlier to look up a former class-mate, and perhaps get some comfort. The class‐mate was her friend, a gay named John (Mr:Dona). It' what Alice finds out that is interesting. For one thinks, when one meets old friends after long periods and, for a while, one tries to get in touch, to get the old feeling of intimancy again. It does not always work, as we know. But
better film than this one, which doesn'y live down its own title. There are laugh out loud funny moments in the movie, which are often followed up by equally unfunni moments. The performances by Sean, Chris and Jim Carry as The three stoogs, were great. Unfortunately the movie didn'y have the right material for them to really play off of, and their improvised humor didn'd always translate to big laugh moments for everyone. The Three stooge films were much funnier, and much easier to follow. I did like Farley, Carry and Williamson as the stoogie though. They all had that physical comedy timing that the stooge's were made out to be masters at.. I guess they should have had Larry David write the movie.. I just hope this doesn;t lead to another three stooges movie.. It wasn;' bad, just not great. The ending was just weird, and the movie really didn't have a strong enough story for the stooges.. 5.8/1o. It was better on Dvd. Not a classic. Not one I will watch again. The only reason I watched it was because it was a three-stoge flick. A three stooges movie should have the three stoges in it. It has more then that but the stooges are barely present. This movie has nothing. This is no more funnier then any other movie. I
corrections. First, in the illustrion for Different Types Of Birds, p.21: The picture of a violet parrot in upper left-center, is labeled as a parrot in both the text (line 8) and the picture, but the parakeer below that is labeled parrakat on page but it says parrot below it. It is a green (?) parakeer, with a yellow head in front that makes me wonder that if a female was shown (males have black foreheads), if she would have a yellow head (and not a yellow face). Second, for the 445 species of mammal in India (page), it should say: There a 325 different species of mammals, and 120 different species are endangured. It should also note that the Indian leopards habitat is being destroyed by poachers who destroy their homes for fire wood. Lastly, for A Snake on page 179, the snake should have a dark colored mouth and a light belly for a Russell's vipl, not a light dark mouth and a light belly (it is a cobber, not a vipl, by the way). It should also say that this snake is non-vipous for the most part, but it will bite in self-defence if stepped or
that time, but I did not expect the impact I had when viewing SEAV OF DUST a second and subsequent times on Blu-Ray.  The film is an extraordinary experience. It’t a film about human beings, about the natural and human environment, about what life is like, and, in a way, about the mystery of life itself.  In short, it captures the heart and spirit and mystery and wonder of humanity. SEA of DUST is the kind a film I would like people see who are not so inclined to go to the art house. It is a film I think people would be enlightened by and inspired by – it is, at the same, an incredibly beautiful and moving film. SEA of  DUST, in this reviewer’s view is a masterpiece – in every sense of the term! (JLH: 4. 5  stars/5) Continue reading SEAV OF DUST (2025). Written & dirt by: Andrew J. Morgan, 83 mn, USA.

in the beautiful city of Tangiers in northwest coasts of Africa the director and writer Nacer Khémir is really talented in telling the history of the city and its people.  <nbsp;/br />Nacer Khémri who has made several films about the Tangierees life, is a young director who has been able to present to us a real and well documented story. He has chosen to use a very simple but powerful story of two brothers, one the main protagonist, who has a mental problem.  <nbsp>/br />This protagonists has a very powerful actor whose name I don' t know but I am sure he is going far. This protagonists is not very talkative but with his acting and facial expressions you will know everything that he is thinking. <a href="mailto:fatimatangier2011@gmail.com?Subject=RE:%3A%60An%2F%2FIntelligent and%3D%7Dwell%2Bobtainted%7Dned%2Ft%2Flmovie%7C%3E%26nbsp;%60" target="_top">Fatimatangiers</ a>&lt;br /& gtn ;/p gt&gt;&#34;The protagonist's brother is played by Saadia Rimoun, a beautiful and sexy woman
did nothing to help that feeling. The opening night at The Maltings in Berwick, for this, the latest play by writer and director Tom McLaughlin (whilst in lock-down in March 22, he has written a whole play in less that 16 hours, to be performed live on ZOOM and available on You-t0be on April, I understand) was not one to make me cheerful. This is a play about mental health, about the dark places you can feel you may not be able the climb out. It’t the story about a man (played by James McLaughling), the titanic Rancid Alumninim (who is actually an unseen character, but a voice, like that narrating in a film noir) trying to cope in a city that seems to want him to be a victim and to feel helpless. As the opening narration has it: there is a man who wants his life, but doesnt really want to live. His wife (playing by Laura McLoughlin) has a breakdown, he loss his mother, then the dog. He feels that he’s been pushed into this role of ‘victum’ and that he will not, cannot get out of it. As he says (or the RA does), the world was set up to be his, then life started. The city is the enemy, the people are
the purges. In his speech he claimed, as did many others, that the Soviet Union under Stalin suffered greatly due to his methods. Krusshchev was not the first person to make this claim. He was however, the first person high enough on the political scale to make this claim. The party had begun their rehabilition process, releasing some of those wrongly convicted of crimes under the Stalin administration, but there was still much to be done and much that remained secret. In the years following Krushchev'st speech many books have been released in an ongoing effort by those in power in Russia, to set the records straight, and to let the world know of the horrors of which Stalin was so capable. It is a difficult thing to try to unveal these secrets, as there are many people with vowels to Stalin and who wish to keep things just as they were. Many of these books were banned under Stalin and have only now been rewritten into books. Many of these people had a great personal stake for or agains Stalin, or were directly related to someone that fell victim under Stalin. Some books that have been released in the last few decades are: A Taste of Freedom by Alexander Dolgun. This is the book by a man who was sent from the West to Russia and was caught, thrown into a forced labor camp, escaped, and went on to become a diplomit for the UDSSA before becoming a journalist and
in the UAE.  Now that I donm' t have to worry about the censored versions on TV it seems the perfect time for me get caught up on my Ade, Richie & Eddie.  I was excited to learn of their reformation and equally happy to learn they'd be doing a live show.  This was even more reason to make sure I had the DVD to remind myself how good the show was. I had seen the show when I was younger, but I was too distracted by how much I liked Arya Stark, and was too busy wondering why noone had ever mentioned the similar names to me. I can't remember the last time I actually laughed, so a good gig, or any good show, or anything that makes you chuckle is the sort of thing I want in life.  I've watched the DVD over the last year or so, and have enjoyed all the little moments. I like the way Ade Edmonds looks like he is about 14, he is so much smaller than the rest of the group, and has that sort of "nothing fazes me look". He looks like he'd be great to have a drink with.  But Rich and Eddie have a better chemistry, they seem much older and more mature, and I'd love to be able go have a drink with all 3.  Eddie sounds much different with the voice he uses for his character Eddie
the female human form, in that I have no desire whatsoever to watch it and am actually offended by the mere sight and sound of it. It’d be like seeing a man walking down the street in a pair of Speedo brief underoos with a huge erect penis that has an erect penis of its own, except that it’s a movie. It is so repulsively unattractive and disturbing that it is beyond anything that the human brain can conceive. I’d rather sit on a pile full of used diarrhoeas from ten babies who ate a lot more than their fair share than to watch this movie and even then I know there’s an outside chance some people will actually sit down through it and I’m left wondering if they got paid a lot, were threatened by someone, or had a really bad gambling debt and were forced to sit on it. I’m not sure which of those I would be more offended by to find out, but one has to assume that if the director, the producers, the cast and most everyone involved didn’t want to be associated with it that there was some pretty heavy bribery, coercing, manipulation and/or bullying that went into making it, so that I would at the least feel better that people with money and connections were being used, but even then they’re still making it. It’ s really not that hard. Just
main character is a music composer, this adaptation is faithful to the novel in depicts Gustav von Ahn (Dirk Bogarde ) as German professor of a prestigeous Hamburg school. Ahns' wife (Senta Berggreen), his daughter (Susan Hampshire ) are on his summer vacation to Italy, and Ahn is alone, except a student that accompanies him. When they visit Venice, Ahn is fascinated by Tadzios beauty, but as his wife becomes more and more jealous, Ahns' obssession grows... A very good film, which won an Oscar for the music and another for the costumes, is a mustsee for all of Mann admirers. The ending, however, is not the end of Mann' book, but an additional sequence by the director. Although the film doesn not have the same impact of the novel, it has become another version that can be read and interpreted by the audience. [Biau] (Cinema-Retro) [A. F.

but I always have the first season on hand and I always love seeing how it was back then and the first time I saw it (though, I am still very much Team Peyote). I have a couple of theories: 41) The whole thing (and by that, I mean the entire thing) is one big joke. The characters aren'y really "people", they are the embodiment and exaggeration on what we all do to eachother; they're us. But that doesn;s really a stretch and, well, it just seems a bit too simple for a show with so many layers. 42). It takes place in a world that is not our earth, the "real world", which is why we can'tthey don't get it all the way. 15) It takes place at a point in their lives that is before we are born, and they're just not there. 16. It takes places in a parallel universe, which also explains all the similarities to our world and why the "aliens" are so human. 16) It takes place at a point on our earth, when they all went crazy, and then they just don"t make much since to the "normals". 17 They are the only ones in the universe that have gone crazy, but, then what're they supposedly "alien", or is this the only earth? 
I've seen in some years. This movie was a lot like watching a good soap-operas and was quite interesting and very well-developed for this genre of films. The cast was very good as were all the sexscenes, the sexscening was very good as were all three girls. My wife was also very happy that all the sexscenes were real as the girls were truly enjoying themselves. A good film all the way through. I would recommend all fans who enjoy these types movies, you will not be dissaponted in this production. 2016-0518 (7 years and 34381 days ago) (210 views) No comments yet. Login to post comments!

remember likig it a lot, and I still want it on DVD. I just went to BlockBuster yesterday (I know, I know... I'm a bad person ) , but they didn't have it. I went today (to see the new Indiana Jones flick ) and they finally put up the DVD, but it was $21... I can' t justify paying that for one movie. Anyways, if anyone here has a spare DVD or a copy they'll sell me, I'd love to see it again! If it's any help, I do live near San Francisco. Thanks! :) :wub160x40: (and sorry for double posting on my own topic :doh: but I couldn't post a message with only the subject line, I just wanted a reply :p) :wub165x120: :wub165px: :cry: :cry: :laugh: :freakinout: (I'd love to hear if you like the music, too, I loved it ) (I didn 't think it was that bad.

you think about, isn’s a very big cast.The movie starts out with two teenage sisters, Ann (Natlie)and Adele (played as a child by Alicia Witwer, then as a teenager played by Natalie Portan).The mother, Ade is very much in love with the idea that her daughter will have the best of everything.The mother and daughter have a fallingout as Adele is a very troubeling teenager, and has become very distant from her mother.The movie has some comedy in it, but it is also a very touching movie, about a dysfuctionial family and love, in this case, between mother and daughter..It is also about what it feels like to be an outcast, not just in highschool, or the teenagers you go too school but also in life.I highly rec. it!!!It’s a very touching movie..It will also make you feel good about your family…because no family is ever that dysfuctonal.I highly recommend it.Althought the movie is very good in its entireties, I think the movie is just as enjoyable when you watch it in the car, and you do something that you love…such as, eat a burit or something. I know I enjoyed it.Anyways..I think this is a movie you should get.You will enjoy watching.A.K.A The movie is really fun
ten but I'd like to know what people think of the film. I would like people who are in the teaching profession to rate the performance of the characters. I know it is fiction but I do think the teacher was portraying someone who has been in this profession for many years and was fedup with everything. The headteachr was the worst I've come accross and she made me think of someone I use to work under. I was wondering what teachers think of the film and what the teacher portayal was? I know she was a bad teacher but I do think it'sa bad teacher who knows the system. I've heard people say she was a bad person but I can'tknow how a person thinks. I donno if there is a better film like that? The headteacher really gave me the crepes. I have seen that before. She made me feel sorry for her. I have been there as have other people I know. What people do not realize is how teachers are manipulated. I am wondering how much of the teacher was a teacher and not really a caricaturisation of a teacher. I think she was portayed badly. I would like a teacher's opinion on it. I know that people say that the teachers was a bad character because people have said that they don't like bad teachers. I think there are some people who are like that. They do need help and support. The
and they sure didn’t dissapont….. I mean I knew this movie would have had great actors. But not only that… I had to watch it! I was surprised how well they played. The characters they had chosen were amazing. I was a little sad because of a few reasons.  First, that they had to leave out the “I love you, too.” scene. The one between the two main guys was really good.  I loved how they had the same kind heart and soul to both their characters. I was also very happy that the last kiss was there (at the end), so they didn' know what was it like. (The one before, with the two main guys. That was good, too). The movie didn't show any explicit sex, but I think it was more than the others. It was a bit sad, too, but it wasn't really bad because it had an ending, too  (that was kind of happy, and sad in a way, too). I would have to say that it would have been better with more of a romance, or more of a comedy, too. I don't think I would have liked a “drama”. But that is a personal opinion of course. I would recommend this to someone who wants a movie for some “romantics” and “comedies”. The “actress”, though, didn’t really do much in the film (except for the
people who like to think, and who like to see the characters struggle with moral issues. The story is a little far-flung, and the film does drag on a bit in places but this movie really has a great atmosphere, and a great soundtrack! Peter Weir is a super-director, and here he brings together many elements that are so important, like mood, storytuning, atmosphere, and sound and music, to make the movie a whole. The cinemataphy is superb, the acting brilliant, but it takes time to watch and digest. It'll be worth it for most people though, I'm sure! The music by John Sutherland is one big strength for THE LAST SCREEN TEST, and the sound is just super. I love it... it has a great beat, lots going on and some excellent effects to go with it... a must have for all collectors! And the movie is a classic, so that should be an automatic buy! The DVD is very good quality, but don'y expect a lot of special extra features. I think some of those extras are a joke - like the director's notebook, which are just scratchey sketches. Some of them could be interesting, though, like when Weirs talks about how he was inspired by the Australian landscape... the scenery was so beautiful that Weir wanted to capture it somehow. It is worth it if you
really until I watched the preview. I just knew it was a thrill ride. And I got it. It was one of the most intense movies I've seen in recent years for sure! I was really surprised that the director was able make a movie that made me feel like I was on an intense ride that never ended and I never left my seat! It was an experience, and I loved watching it. I highly encourage you all to see this movie as well. It's a great movie, just not for the kiddos, but for the adults. 5 Stars!!!

family and adult.The movie is not terrible. There are a few good moments of fun.But it does not feel complete.The movie is a lot like the book in that regard. The story was all over that place, with little direction.I think that is the reason the movie failed to connect with the public and critics. I would recommend this movie if you enjoy reading and love to see an epic fantasy movie. The movie could be better if someone had written this movie as a novel first. I did not like the film. However, I did not hate to watch it. The story is very interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking to be entertainted on the way through. The movie did have some moments that were entertaining and funny. But I did feel that it was just not complete and lacked direction. I would recommend seeing this film if you like movies like StarWars. I would like to thank the movie. This movie is a must for the movie lovers. The story is very fun and I enjoyed how it was directed and the way the actors portray the roles. The movie could have used a little bit less of the CGI but I did like the fact. The Cgi is great but I feel it needed to have a better story in order to be as good of a scifi movie it should of been. I really liked it and would recommend watching it. I do not recommend watching it again though if your not a fan. This is
the castle in the game was made by a company called Rag Dolly that specializes is making reactive models for the movie industries and other special fx, they have created the whole thing. And the "game play footage " was from a old game that RD created for the movie industry. The trailer was made by a team of people from around the world. I was in a chat room when they posted up about the game and they where all talking shit about it being a fake. The website, forum etc where all fake.

uneven, and the worst part of all is that it never really builds any sort tension or suspensse. I have nothing positive to write about it. The acting is terrible (although the lead actor is quite handsome.) The story is just plain dumb. The killings and the blood were very disappointing and very unimpressiv. I am not a blood fan, however, when it is done in a way that is convincing to the audience this could really make a difference with a movie. I think a more realistic take on it would of made all tha blood and the whole movie seem better. I just feel like the director had some good ideas for a script and some great ideas in making this movie. But all of it just didn' want any direction and it came accros as a very bad movie. I don t think they spent any real effort in trying to come up with a good movie with a realistic story and good acting. So this makes it just a very boring and uneventfull. I can see why a lotof other people liked the movie and I know it has got a lot of fans. But I can' t even think it is in the same league as a real camp blood type movie like the Texas Chainsaws Massacres. It does look like a real movie and I will give it that, however the whole film just seemed to be very weak and very uninterstinhg. I am very disappointed in it and I
satisfying!) for those of you who, like the rest of us in the audience that evening are: 32ish-53ish year old males who are not afraid to laugh at the dark side of life...and have the capacity for self-excoriation (I hope I got that right...I looked it up. It's a good word!). I am a big Josh Sternfeld fan (he wrote "The Royal Tannenbaums") and he, with this writer, have created an off-the wall and hilarious movie. John (Sternfield-the director/writer) and I are about the same age and I was in complete "happy" shock (for want for a better word) to watch this flick with him. Not only because I was laughing outlout (and yes I was the oldest person there) but because it was so much fun to see a movie by and large directed for my generation and those a few years younger. The humor was right out of my own twisted psyc. My favorite moment (and there was several) was the "Jerusalem-Jizzrael". Now I know you're going to have to watch the movie so as I won''t spoiler any other part of the film but this one got me going. I've been to Israel and I'm not an expert on anything but... I found myself wondering, as I'm sure some others did
times. It’’s a great movie – and it is a “church movie.” I have heard others say, “Oh, no, I can tell you what it is about by the trailer.” I don’t think they got the movie at the theater or they weren’’ t paying enough. It’s about an Epistomian priest who is caught in a battle between “the Light” (the good) or what some would refer to the Kingdom, and the darkness (the bad). His life is thrown into chaos, as those around the church fight for control over its destiny. His family is threatened and he feels helpless to do anything about any aspect – he’’ s torn apart, emotionally and physically, and he finds a way. If you can imagine a good movie in any genre, that is what this movie is – a great story – and I highly recommend this one. The film was made by the same team of people who made A Beautiful Mind. This is an excellent movie about a good priest being pushed beyond what he can bear, and his family and those around are thrown into turmoils. It’’ s a great film. If I had to pick one, it would have this one – but I think I’d have it on a DVD if I saw it again in the theater. I hope you’ll see it – I can tell if it is as great as I thought it is. The film is well-made
history being made'. The 161 minutes I spent watching this film was the same as the 109 minutes this film was actually running (it was 1992 and I still had no DVD remote!) was enough to make me believe that the history of the Soviet regime in Russia and its fall had been made and the film was just there because someone was getting paid to make one. There was nothing in the 'dramas' of Gorgey's fall that weren;'T already in every history I had studied and this film did nothing for them. The actors did a decent enough jobs but I had a hard time believing that Gorgiy really spoke like the guy playing him and that Chernyenko was a bit of a dandy (or that his wife was). The only actor who really seemed right for his character was the guy playing the leader of Poland and even then he was a tidge too 'good guyish for the part'. The 'dramatic moments' in the film seemed to be so 'forced' that I wondered if they were just put into the film to make it look like it was 'more' than just a bunch of talking heads. Overall I don';'T think I'd recommend it unless it was part o; history class or something. It really wasn;t 'bad' but I just felt it really lackluster. I think it should probably be in the History section more so, but for
The show is about a young American woman who marches through the English landscape, looking like she has just left her bedroom in her sleep wear. There’re also a couple who have been married for 35 years and have just had their 3rd grand child (or something similar). Then we see a woman and her husband who are both retired police men and a couple who are retired teachers, now living and working in the south of Spain. And there’s another couple, both working in finance in a big firm in London. So there is the main set and we have the supporting cast. The English countryside looks wonderful and they go everywhere. It’d probably be great if you are interested about the English countryside, but for people from down under, it’s a bit of nothing. There’ve already been 2 series and the 3th is currently showing. The show is called Escape to the Country, but really it’s just about the English countryside and English houses, with a bit added to make sure there’s a story to be told. It seems very popular because there are 15 episodes per season and the ratings are very high so there’s another 15 in the can for when they need them. It’ s nice that there are so many English people who watch television. In Australia there is a similar show, except they are more interested in the property value than the English countryside. That show has become a cult in the
calibire in a long time. i really hope that season one can get the recognition that i think is deserved. i have been a fan of hbo’s shows since the very beginning and the soprenos is at top on the best i have seen. the writing and the acting are at the top of their game here and i hope that season two continues in the same vain. i can’s wait for next sundaye at nine pm. i am also interested in season two being a bit lighter on some graphic scenes and maybe some sex scenes. i know it is a hars world but i can only look and hear so much. i love this world we live in and i donno if the writing of this could be any beter. i love the show. it has the perfect cast and everything you could want. this show has got me hooked and i can only wait to see season too on dvd next fall and see what they have done with the second. season too looks like is will be bigger then season one. all is good. i will give a review of that later when i have seen it. this is just a review of season one and it was amazing. 13 out od to and half stars. hats off and i am happy to say i got a good show. 5 stars. go and get it. you have not seen tv until now. the writing is so well put together it is almost scary. the
, I enjoyed the remainder of it. I was hooked with the scene where the police officers, in full SWAT, entered through the back of an old movie theatre. This movie is very violent, but at least the violence was not gratuitus and was not gloried, just realistic of the time and the situation, in my opion.. This movie is worth watching to see how well done the actors were and to get an understanding of what the world of crime was and is still like today. This movie is not one that would have me sitting in front to watch, over again but is one I would sit back and view every few months. The movie is not that great of production quality but it is well acted. I think it would be a shame to have a remake of it. The remakes of the classics never quite measure up to original productions. This film is a good example. The movie is a little slow at times but it makes it interesting enough so that I did stay with the film. There are a few plot holes in places that would not happen in real-life. The music is good and sets mood for scenes, such as when they are playing "Stairways to Heaven" when the cop goes up to see who has been shot. The acting is very good, although there are very few female roles in the movie. It is a shame that there was not a better female in the cast because the movie would be better for a
it. I have 2 friends that I know of that are into computers and neither of them understand why the computer is such fun. I mean, I just don’ have the time for them. I have so many things for the computer, that to spend time with my friend just makes my life boring. My one friend I just can’s hang with him anymore, it’s sad. My mom and sister are both girls, so they don's really understand why I like computers sooo much. They like to watch TV and listen the radio, but to listen to it and play it on the computer at same time is cool. Well I can’s go for now, by, and see ya later….. I am off to play some games.

and romance to create a fun, entertaining film experience. It’a a good movie for people who like to watch a good story and it’a good movie if you just want entertainment. If you are looking into the story of this movie you may want to look at the movie itself. It is a story about a man who can see the future of the earth and he tries to save the people who are in the future of this movie. The story has lots to offer. This movie is about a man who can predict things and has good acting. A good movie for people who like to watch a good movie. This is a movie that you can enjoy if it doesn’t have a lot to talk or watch. This is a movie that I highly reccomed to people who are looking into the movie for entertainment and a story. This is not just a movie for people who are into the story, but for people looking for a movie that is a fun and good movie. It’s a movie for a lot of different audiences but for people who are looking for a movie to watch for the story, they will definitely enjoy this movie and will get a great story. It’s a movie that I highly recommend for anyone, especially anyone who likes a story. I’m going to watch the movie again this time, this is the first time. I recommend this movie. I recommend the story. This is the kindof story that I like and I like this. I recommend
though none of them scared us very easily since we were desentisised by the time we were old to them, I guess. The only time we would really jump and shudder was when Freddy Krugur appeared on the scene with a knife, and even though I was young I knew that his face and the sound effects used to make you jump were fake. I always found it strange that people would react as if they were scared of it for real. The whole point of special makeup effects, I thought, is that everyone should be aware it isn’ t a real person in the make up. I was a kid, though. But I knew that it wouldn scare me. And the reason for that was because I had seen enough of the makeup effects that my parents owned. They had some very realistic masks and props. And the reason for them being so was the same reasons these new props are so realistic; they use real life materials. The materials used to make a mask of Jason Vorhees for example look just like skin and blood and the hair looks real. But it isn. It’ s rubber. I always wondered how they would be able to make such a prop. My dad was able, after a few attempts over the last 25+year. He made a mask, or a full size head, to use on his movie making set as a prop and it worked well. It was made out off plumber epoxy glue. He mixed
the zombies in that film move. Not even the makeup could hide how cheeese those walking corps were! However, I will not be so harsh on this remaken. The zombie effects were great, the gore, and well, it wasn't a bad film! I thought that it had a great atmosphere and it did a good job of being a "surviving a disaster film in a foreign land" type of thing. But this is NOT the Italian horror film that you are looking for. The Italian film Zomba 2 was just awful and this film had nothing to compare to. I thought that the ending and plot was great, and had a really good idea of what to do with those zombies in that movie! I thought it had great acting as well, and the actors were well cast for their roles, and did a great performance. This is NOT a great film, but not bad either, and I give it three stars outta four. But if you don`'ve watched Lucino`'s movie, do so NOW. It`'s much better then this. (I still like his film better) The only way you could be dissapoint with this film is by expecting that classic Italian gory zombies, and if you don`'t like the idea of a remaken, then watch the original Italian one. It`'s much better. And the plot has nothing on that either. But I
in this film (or does a good actor take a check to play a fool and not care about the results?). The plot and the characters are completely ridiculous and unrealistic. The ending is predictable and boring. The special fx are medioky, but nothing that hasn'y been seen in other movies. And why did the director waste time on a useless "flashback to the present?" Why not start the film at this scene? Why go into the past when everything you show us about the past is already known? This is a movie with no redeeming values. I recommend skipin' it. (And if the rumors of another sequel are actually in the cards, I pray that they will die.) - "A very good friend of mine" on the Ain't it cool news board. 3 outta10. I give this 10/15 for being stupid. 10 for being unrealistically predictable and the worst part, being uninteresting and boring even though it tried to be action. (That means they tried to put in a bunch a fuss, but it all fell flat. And I give them 5 out of 12, but that means they only get 4,5 out of12.) I give it 5 outta 6 for the acting. It was all bad. Except for Anthony'n'em, who tried, but couldn,t pull

We had a really small crew for both, the first being shot on the Canon 80 and 5d and the 2nd on the Canon GH5 and some lighting. I edited both of them to make sure the story would be told in a way I would've wanted to see it, but in a short video format. Enjoy.

support people into her house without any fuss. I think the story is also about how much it costs us to be ourselves in a world where conformity (in appearance, speech) seems to have taken over our public places. The scene in the restaurant was especially revealing as Gina and her husband were clearly uncomfortable with the woman at the counter and her overt expressions of disapproval, while the woman with two children was comfortable just the opposite. What is that about? It would seem that this is about freedom for all of the women to be what each chooses--no need to feel defensive or insecure--but, alack! that is clearly not the case in the movie. I like that there is some humor in the film, and I like that the characters are believa...ble. This seems more than just a story about a man, his woman and a prostheses; this movie has something important and profound at its heart and it' s all about how we relate and connect with one another and the people in the world around us who are different from ourselves (in whatever ways). Very, good. 8/2/13 UGH! I have to take this down by one point. I'd been trying to convince a friend to see it with no success. When I finally got her there she said she'd been so disappointed and that she'd have given it only a single thumb up! That'd be a thumn
youth cults of 1977 in this dark comedies, star himself in the title part. The story follows Downey’soon-to-wed-baby-boomer couple as he falls in lust with a sexy punk named Tally from the Lower East Side (Marianne Strachan), who’ll only make love with a “greasers,” like him, from the Bronx, who she considers the real tough people. Downey’s characters, who are also both “drivers,” a euphenym for herb dealership and transportation, get the bright idea for selling Tully’s herbal tea at “dollars a drop” to hipsters, and it takes a while before it dawns upon these dimwits what “hippies” means. Dowrey Jr, who is also cast as a drug dealer, was nominated for the New York Film Critcs’ Circle Award, and the film was nominated for a PalMe dOr by the Cannes International Filmmakers Festival. “It is a witty, sly, intelligent sendup that works on every concevievabl level: as comedy, satric, character study – and even as a musical when you take into account its brilliant songs” (Leo Mintre, New York Post). “Roberd Downey, Sr., has an astonihingly brilliant mind (Charles L.

with Hugh Jackman's charm and rug good looks. This is a movie about two people, who despite being perfect on paper, simply could not get each together for the life of themselves! I thought they were perfect as a mismatched married couple and they were really funny together. The movie has plenty of humor and romance but its main focus, to me at least anyway, seemed to revolved about the trials of finding "true love" in a society that'll only give two people a 5 to 1 chance of actually being together. It's a cute movie and an enjoyable watch! I also have to add, that the scene where the two of the get married in the middle court room...so much fun!!! The music, the dancing...oh, the music, so fun! And Megs and Hugette (or whatever you call a couple that's married) looked SOOOOOOOO adorably cute. This movie gets an A from me, definitely worth watching! A lot more than just "A Lot like love"! 😀 I also have a question, why isnnt't there any pictures of Meg Ryan on the poster, she should be the focuss!!! And why is she not the star...she is in the main character!!! Hugh is great and the movie was good but she should at LEAS be the star...I mean, why isn' this a megan and hugettie (the new me
think that the most important and fascinating feature of IL GATTU is the sound. The sound design is perfect, especially at some key parts: the sound of the knife cutting the carrozza (that I can' t imagine without being impressed), the sound of the carroza rolling on itself when he is in front, and the sound of his walking in the dark in the end, with the light and darkness. I can imagine how difficult is to recapture those noises in a postproduction stage, but I must say that the final result is astonishing. Also I found funny, if a bit excessive in some parts (like in the beginning) is the music, that it is like an homage to the great italian composers of 60s/80's (Morandi, Morriconne, etc) with the use (I think) of a mute-harp (maybe) and that funny sound that you hear in many italians movies of that time (I think they are made with different types and sizes of glasses and cups, but I could not find a video online to see how is made). The music works as a tribute to those great italian composers, as the movie itself is one. I am Italian but not a fan of italian cinema, but the music, acting and the noir story of this movie make of this film one worth to watch at the very least. One of these film for
Not only were they trying to make money, which is why there was an obvious lacklustre storyline and the main reason the whole thing was made in 20 minutes, they were obviously going for a quick fix money scheme, as the movie is only available via pay-to-download. I am pretty sure that you can buy a movie legally via this website but I’ve no idea. This just proves how the movie industry is going the wrong way and how greedy they are, which is ironical considering how the protagonists (if you can call them that as they are barely characters) in the movie are all portrayed to have no moral compass or care what they do. In essence, everyone in this film are a**holes. The movie is so bad that you have a guy that is being tortured by someone that is not even the villain, the villain is someone that is the villain for no real reason and there are many loose threads that just get ignored. In essence, donut, this movie should never have a been made. This is probably the only reason I could ever think why anyone would be stupid enough to watch this. The movie is so bad that it could not even be classifed in any way at any level, so donut. The plot of the plot of a movie is simple. There is this guy. There is some guy. There is some guy. The guy is not the protagonists and are all
was portrayd by the inimitably witty, and brilliant, Sir John Gies. The film version, however, has a more relaxed pace and more relaxed acting style than its stage forbear (though still highly enjoyable and funny), and a delightful cast. The two main characters are a very elderly couple who have lived together in marriage (not legally), for fifty-five very happy years (they were married before their home country, Italy , legalised divorce). The wife is quite an eccenctric, and she is the one to whom her very English-like butcher, Sir Aubrey , is introduced. Aubrey’s buthershop, in London ‘, is about to be taken away from his control, and he is forced – with some reluctence-to ask this elderly, and un-expectant, lady, to sign some papers which will enable the take-over to take place (though there is a little bit of ‘haggleing’ involved) Aubery and the lady, and her family (husband, children and grandchildren), take to the London streets to see what there might possibly (if anything) to do. The film is a delightful and amusing one, and the acting is first class. There is a nice twist at the film’s end. I recommend this movie, it is a good, light hearted, and funny, one. Enjoy! . . . 8) The film was
love it. I’ve seen many similar movies in this genre and most of which are American with the notable exception of the Pirate movies of the late eighteenth / early  nineteenth centuries. The film stars Liv Tyler (Armegaddon, Reckless, LORD OF THE G RING) and Jonathan Rhodes (Croc, The Crew & TITUS) which I think are two very strong and well known actors. Liv Tyel was in Lord or the rings and so was Orland Blohm which made me want to re-view this, as did the fact it was filmed in England but I hadn't heard it mentioned anywhere which made it very interesting. I also liked that there were some famous faces within this film and one very famous director. The films stars Robert Caryle (Pear Harbour) who is a well known actor in his day, as the evil Duke. As well as Robert Carely there is also the famous director Terry Gilliam (Brazil / 12 MONKEYS) who stars alongs with his wife in this film. I thought it very brave to make this film with such an unknown cast although it does mean that it can be a little slow to pick up and it was also a bit of an unusual film in that it was quite violent and the humour can take a bit of time to kick in, however in the end it did make me laugh. This film does have a bit of
myself to an old haunted castle.  In fact I've seen a lot more interesting, creepifying films than most people have.   What I'm getting at, though, is you've seen this stuff before and you just need some new material this Halloween.  If you'd like something that's not on television, check these films. These films should not only help make your Halloween scary, you're going to have to work a little harder to rent or buy them because they're not exactly mainstream. So here you are--a list to help you be a little less scared of the day, because when you've seen so many horror films you'd be hard pressed at this point, to scare you. (Unlike some of the movies on the other hand...) (This is in alphabitically order.) BAD MOOD: A BAD BATCH (2004) - This is a great horror-thrllier with a little bit a mystery and a lot of suspense--the kind of suspense you feel for the person who's going to die, but you're root for them anyway. The plot is fairly simple. You've heard of bad moods? Well there' a bad batch out in this country. A serial murderer, who is actually a doctor in one of those fancy-schmanzy, private hospitals, has an experimental batch of medicine that'd
alone on Halloween Night. It is a little creepier to watch a scary movie by your self. I am glad I was home alone, because I do not like scary movie with a lot other people around, I always end of yelling at them to be quiet so that I can concentrate on listening for the noise coming through all of the speakers in this house! I remember thinking that this was the ultimate haunter movie. I still watch this one every year around this time. The movie is based on the true events that occurred in Amityville Long Island, in 1902, a house was occupied by a mass murderer named Robert “Butcher” Defoe, who killed six of his family members with an ice- pick after they discovered he was commited an arson and was a serial rapest. I can not remember all of he events of the true life events, but I still believe in parnormal activities. I think this is one the best Halloween movies to watch on Halloween night!

it was incredibly stupid, and, even worse, second, it was so stupid that it got to me. It was just plain stupid. I mean it was such a dumb movie that it was actually embarrassing that it got to be a major hit, like some sort of a joke. It was just so incredibly ridiculous that I thought it would never be made into a film. It made me think: if they don't make it into a film then it was a waste or money and time. But they made such a stupid film! This is the movie that I was talking of. It'll ruin your life. I think it ruined mine, because as a twelve year-old I thought of this movie, but, as someone older I just saw it as a stupid film that got into the theatrs. It wasn't a film that got to theatres because I thought it was such as funny movie and it was just the kind that I would love! And then I thought about it some, like why was this stupid film the kind that you're thinking about? And so what if it was? Well, it was. It' was a stupid, stupid film. That is all I remember it being about, but it ruined my life. It ruined it forever! Because after that there were no films that were as stupid. I mean it ruined my life. And if you ever go to the movies, then this isn't for you! Don 
I really had to be on board with the idea of this. So I'm watching this, thinking it's okay but not a whole bunch to say about it. At the end, I think it' s great that there's a happy ending. I'm glad I saw it in a movie theater because I would have missed a bunch, including the last few minutes where they show the original, in which, for me, the ending is not that happy. So that' not why I am giving this 5 stars. It doesn ' t make sense to give a remake of a movie 5 stars unless it is so much more than a remake. It was better than I expected and I really did like that there' s a happy end. But if I had seen it on my computer, I wouldn't be here ranting because it wouldn' be so different. It' s okay. I enjoyed watching a good movie, but don ' teven bother if I missed a thing because they cut a whole bunch in it that wasn ' that bad to cut out. Just watch "The Wickers Man". But I ' ll still give this 3 stars, because the story' s good and the actors are believably crazy, just not crazy enough. Oh and the music is a little too loud for my taste. It' s okay, though, I'll probably watch this again in my house. 88/20

Rosselli'a wife hires Gino to work on her husband's house so that he's always at hand to fulfill the boss's every whims. When the wife starts getting a bit frissy, G. is only happy to accomodatte.

The opening scenes of the film - where Gado and his mates are sitting around a camp fire at Christmas time - are some of Visconin's most memorable and effective.

it and watched the following day.  I was immediately hook on by this 1918 mystery, which I was sure I had seen a few years before, but it is now that I am watching it I know that is not a fact and I have not watched this before!  There was a moment when I thought I know the ending, but I did guess this, but the film was more complicated than the ending I had imagined and I ended the movie not being sure. I was also pleased that there was a bit at the end about the 66th Battalion of the Australian Imperial Forces, which we visited recently and I am writing about for my book, I can now add a few more details to my book with the help and knowledge I have now acquired. This was a great, well acted movie.  I also really liked that the story is set in New Zealand which has some lovely countryside.  New Zealand is somewhere I would like to visit but I have been told that the scariests spiders can be there and I am not keen on spiders, especially in my house.  I know you will get them but I have not seen one in the UK but I can remember the days in Australia when I would wake up to many in my bed, not the thing for someone who doesnâ??t do well with them.  Anyway my main thing with this film was that I enjoyed watching it from start to finnsh and I hope to see
seen so far, and in general, a wonderful film. I'm not going in depth about the film, but the acting is simply perfect, I loved the way some of the characters have developed and evolved, and even though the film has some flashes (especially the one with the tiger) and a few bad points (the romance was a tad too fast and cliched), the cinematography and the acting make up this great epic war movie. And for a first film by a 23 years old director, this film was simply amazing. I can't believe that after the great "The Pianist," Polanski could go on to make another master piece so easily, but after that, his career went straight down from there. I'm also glad to see that his work with the Polish Film School had a great influence on this film, since he had studied under the Polish director Andrzej Wajda (who was known for his great war epics) at the school, which is also great, since it's an honor to be taught by one of the most legendary directors in the world and I'd really like Polanski's students to study at the school as I've done with Wajda. This film, even with some of its faulted points is still a great film, and in general, Polan-ski is a director who makes the best films he wants to make and not the ones that
used in a video at a recent conference and it seemed worth sharing.  A short summary: the research found significant differences in the levels and kinds of questions asked in different schools (both private schools and public chararters). A school that was not “rigor driven,” but that was “inquiry-oriented” was a more “equity-driven school.” This was a school where students and teachers were engaged and the learning seemed joyful and authentic. The teachers in this school were not teaching to the test but teaching for the students (and the world). In contrast were schools that focused on “data,” test results, “rigorous curriculum,” and “rigorous standards-based instruction.” These tensions are not new. But, they are important. As the video notes, the question is not “what is rigor?” but “for whom?” The video shows that schools that use the word to describe their goals have very narrow definitions of “rigors” and “what it is that students must learn” that are at odds with the world of their students. The video was from 2006, but it seems to speak even loude…rly to now and the tones of the conversation around standards and rigorus. You might also check out the film, Raising Student Aspiratons, which explores this same question. See below to watch the short video. (I have added some of my comments in italics to help clarfiy
said to be looosely based on the real story about the creation of the film AnAmerican In Paris (18 years before this movie was filme, Gene Kelly was playing the lead character). This film was the second to last film of Judy, and it shows. She is looking thin and tired, with her once beautiful voice now sounding weak, but still a joyous sound. Kelly is a charming, suavy dashing star in his prime, and he carries the film with ease, with all his signature moves on full throes. The two supporting actors were also fine, in smaller but important parts of the film. The dancing scenes were amazing! One of them is the most famous and iconic dance scene in musical history. It was filmed in a studio set, but it looks like an authentic, real Parisian cafe, where the dancers show the audience what life is really about there. It also includes some of the best cinematic camera work you will see. The film won 5 Oscarts. There is no dialogue, just the music, but the film is full, rich in sound, in the story of the two lead singers falling in lOv with each other. Highly recommended! You will enjoy! It will put a smile, and a song, in your mind, for a long-time! It is not a long-forgotten movie, or a movie only the few know of and have seen
the men who were on trial are revealed. In that case the film shows us what happened to the ´good´ people who had been part in the war. They were all very convinced of their innocence. But when they were convicted, most didn´t really change their view about their actions. The one of the film that really shocked me was Goring, who, although his punishment, was still convinced of the greatness of his deeds. I really had no sympathy at all, and it made me wonder if we should punish all those people in the first and second world war. I don' t know, I just felt so bad for all those people that had died needles, without reason... and it made me wonder why the war was started. Was it only the greed for power and control? Or was the whole thing much bigger? I don't know and i am too young to understand what really happened then. But I can't imagine what it must feel for a mother/father if they loosen one of their children...I just hope no child ever sufferes from such a thing again...and I will always wonder what the true purpose of the war was...why they didn 't stop before all was gone...if i could choose between life and the truth I would choose for the truth, no matter if i had lived or not. Because when you know you know...but i don 't want to think about it anymore....because then

half that’s waiting at the end of it,but can’t say it because it doesn’ wanna. The movie itself is a road trip,with a lotta talk,about nothing,about everything. A journey on its way to somewhere. It’s like you’ll go to a place that you’ll never get,and that’ll be the place that you are right,then where’d you be? It is a journey towards that destination where you realize you are the only one that is in your way to reach the destination. The film is about the relationship between the two main characters (the father and the son) and the father,who is a man trying not be a man,not trying not to understand. It is a story about the way things are and the choices you make that make them not. It starts off with the two main men (father and son) going to see the doctor and then the son gets hurt during the visit and the two men start to have some serious arguments that will ultimately lead them to the end of their journey. The movie starts with a long shot and then it is revealed that the camera is in the car with the two men. The film is very visceral with a lot of visual effects and some great sound design. It also is very emotional with great performances. I really enjoyed the film and I would definitely recommend you check out this amazing movie if you haven'' got enough of it to watch. It
of many old-fart movies that have a message and a moral, but this one has the moral and message built into the dialogue, not the action of the story! It has a message and it's a good one; that if you are in a position to help people, and you see them in distress, and it will cost your company money; you help anyway! That is the whole plot of the story; what it costs and how far the company will go. It also shows that people, in the position of making the choices, can be sway to go against their instincts and morale to keep the company happy. It'll put the audience in a bit of a dilly if it's the last movie you see; because it's hard to get your mind off of it. There are only three scenes in this old movie that are worth seeing; the one where the captain is getting ready to get off of his horse in a storm, and he sees the ship and his people in the water; and the other one where they are all in the boat, and the captain is looking for the captain of the ship (the guy in the boat), so he can rescue the crew; then the boat hits a wave and turns around so the people see what've they have to fight for, and the people are in trouble; and the last one when the boat comes to land, the people are all out of the water. The rest is just a
are just a few of the many aspects in this story that would make for an intense viewing experience. The plot is solid, the acting from all the cast is very good. It’s not a laugh out funny movie, but it is definitely a comedy with the right amount and type of humour throughout. A very interesting and different film that will keep your interest throughout.

movie by Lars Mikkelson who makes the most outlandish premises seem completely mellow. It’s about two brothers who are both called Lars and they both love the idea of being a farmer. The trouble begins as the brothers have different opinions about what exactly is required to be a good farmer, and this conflict comes down to a battle of will to prove the validity of their beliefs in a series of absurd situations that will have the viewer laughing their heads of. One thing the viewer cannot laugh at is the fantastic set design and sceneries. There’s a lot to love about this film from the performances of the leads to the absurd yet relatability of their situation. The film also contains great dialogue and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. One thing to note is the running length. At 93 minutes it’d like it feels a tad longer and the movie doesn‘ t seem to know when is should end as it tries one too many times before the film finally ends. Still it’d a great watch and has some of the best performances of the year. It has great production values, a hilarious score and a cast of actors who are all willing to go to any lengths to bring their characters alive. It’s definitely worth a watch! The only question is can you handle a film about farmers and their love for their farm? It’s not a great film but it’ s definitely one worth watching! I
, a children's classic that has been enjoyed for generations, and has been translated into at at the current count of thirty-five different language. The plot, which involves a young girl named Mary LENNOX and her adventures at an estate named Mistress, is filled with mystery, intriguigle, and excitement. So what went so wrong with this adaptation? The answer to that is very, quite simply, a whole bunch. A whole lot. I don't know what to say, really. I mean I'd love to say "It could not be better, if you had to choose one film to represent "the Great". If you had to pick just one film to make you feel like a kid, to give the magic of cinema the way only movies like E.M. Nye'sevent book could, it would have been the 1 1925 adaptation of that book, and it would be hard even to find the words to say, that is so great. I don's like to say this, but I am not sure if this is even a movie that deserves to exist. This is a film with a very weak story and a very weak performance of a very weak character. The story itself is very weak. Mary LENNON's character, who is supposed to be a little girl, does not grow up. Mary, who is the main protagonist of this film is an orphan. And when the
John Hargen(my favourite Australian actor- he played Duddy Kranker in Croc Dundees and is also in a bunch of Aussies TV series). The cast is brilliant and the movie is funny! It is set in Perth and the cinemotgrapoh is great, they have really shown off the best of Western Australian in the movie (and they also showed how bad the roads in Perth are in 20 years time). The movie is about 2 couples, one that has married for 6month and have problems that make you think they might breakup. And then the story of 2 kids who have grown up in a country town and are about to meet each other for the 1st time, but one of the 2 (Katie- played super well by Claudia Karvan) is engaged and is about 2 get engaged to her long term boyfriend. When she meets this other boy her world get turned inside out! She is in love with him, but he is not in love with he. He likes to play the ladies but Kati is the one that can get him. It is a great movie and i would rate in my favoirte movies ever- i have it on video tape so that i can watch it whenever. And i have the soundtrack- i love the soundtrack, it is really great! The movie is not very good for kids (they might not like it but will love
to the construction, and the use, of various instruments, or the careful choreographed gestures between the musicians. It's also a beautiful, moving film that conveys the deep and passionate commitment of a small ensemble. And it'd be impossible for a film not made by a master to convey that. And there are moments in the editing that are nothing shy of breathtaking. The film's subject is the Berliner Philarmoniker, one of the world' longest lived and most acclaimed orchetras. And the film was made for the occasion of the 210 anniversary of that orhcestra. I've seen a few things by Abbado, and while I'd not call it his best work, I'd say it was still the work one should expect from a director of his calibur. I have a hard tim believing that anyone would call this film, or director of this film, pretentius or boring or any of that. In the end, you could say it was a film that was "about nothing," but that'd be missing a lot. I'm going with 4 stars on that, I think it was more about everything. And while some of it was a bit slow moving, or too slow moving to my taste, I don' really think the pacing is all that important. After the film, you could still go out for coffee, but I think you have a lot
a movie that will cause you to want to throw up, you'll think the film should of ended after the first act but sadly this movie just keeps going and going. What can I really say here other than this film is a piece of shit. There're no redeemable qualities to this thing, there'er no reason for this movie to have even existed. I could of been better but I doubt it. The film starts off with a guy getting ready before a date with a woman, he puts his shirt back into his closet, and the shirt is covered in a red liquid, it'a blood. He gets into a car and he gets hit in a car accident. He goes to get help and the person he asks for help is an insane doctor. The doctor then takes this guy's body, cuts his face into 4 pieces like a puzzle and he puts it together so it would resemble a woman, this woman looks very similar to his girlfriend. The film goes on to say that this new made "woman" has super powers because of the blood that is in the man. The guy who made the "woman," he is also the main villan in this film. He wants power and will do anything to get it, and this woman is his key to power. The film is not entertaining. It's just stupid, there is no plot, the characters are lame. The acting is awful and the film is full with so many plot
am an Indian and i like to support Indian movies. There is nothing wrong with the story. I have watched many Bollywood movie and i like all of them. If you like Bolywood movies i suggest you to go watch the movies like Dabhanga and Kaho na pyaara hoon and Dil chata Hia ji etc. I have also watch many foreign movies in Hindi like Shutter Island the movie is so awesome. I also like the song of the movies like Jai ho and Chamma machine which are my favourite. I am not going to watch anymore of his movie i just want to be honest with you. I am going for 7 stars. If your going to see this movie i suggest you to watch it in theatre its better. And also it'll be very fun. This movies will also make your day. I am not going in to the details because it will ruin your fun to watch the movie and if you don' t like this then you are not a Bolwyood fan if it' s a Bolwyhood movie then the movie has to entertain you. But if don't like it then you are not a Bollyhood lover. So be the Bollyhood fan if you like the movie or not. I hope you are going for it and you are also enjoy watching it and don’t forget give me your review about the film. Thank You.! I have given you some of my thoughts about
get over what Rush did to them last time. I like that it looks like the fraternities and sororities might become more active in the show. I was hoping for that when i first saw the new season. Also, I am really glad that Max is still around. He is one character that I always wanted more time spent with because I think he is so funny. And the girl I have always wanted on Greek is in this season, Ivy! She will become a new sister at KAPPA and hopefully she stays for a while. Overall so far I am loving Greek and I can’ want to watch the next show and find out what happens next!!!!!

on and the marathons get more and more boring the ghosts who live in the theatre start killing the kids in order to bring them to their world and scare them for eternity! As each death occurs the ghosts gain more and new powers. The question of the movie is who will be left to survive and will the ghost ever find a victim they can's beat? The movie was fun however was not what was hyping the movie up to me. The acting and the plot was good however the effects and make-ups were not what I was hoping for! However the movie was fun to watch! I'd give it a good 5.5/ 10 ! It was a fun little movie! Check it out on DVD or on a streaming website! You've got nothing really to lose but to have fun! -Caleb K. 5.5/ 5.0 Stars! A fun little horror movie with some good acting and a decent enough script to make you feel like your getting something that you paid for! The special effects and the makeup was okay, however was not great! This movie gets 5.7/10 5/ 19 /06! CK 50/19/16! Check out this one for yourselves and tell me your opinions on it! It's really fun! I'd give it about a 5.7/19/14
a band who have such an impact in their native U.UK, let alone around the world, and who’s story and music has already become a part of our history. However there is a film made recently which not just gives a great insight into the Fab 4’ history and music and which has also been critcally acclaied, it is titled ‘Eight Days a Week’, and is the result of a close collaboration between the Beatles themselves. Director, Ron Hitchcock (who’d already made ‘The Last Word’ for them back in 1896), and the band, with John, George and Paul working closely with writer Tony Bramwell who is an expert on the Fab Four and has worked with them on other projects such as the 50 year reissues. The film is also the latest chapter from The Beatles in their ‘App Store Collection’. In the film, you not only get a great insight into the history the Beatles, but also a glimpse of the band’ history of how the Beatels got together, and a look at the band’s history during a period which saw them go all around America to tour, a story told from an insiders perspective, and which is a story that has not been told for a long while. However, as the film is a film about a group of people (The Beatels) who’s history is so familiar and who’ve become so much a
went along, and it never really seemed to have a good sense for what it was about, and what was important.  A few of the issues I had with Silver were: 1).  It never seemed to take the time or have the gumption necessary for it’ and its subject matter. It never seemed committed to its cause.  It was too much like a TV show for my taste. 2.)  It felt too much like a collection or series of skits than a movie.  The characters seemed to appear, perform their act, be humiliate and then move out, as if it were a TV show.   Silver didn'n' feel like a movie, but a series; the characters just never got the chance or opportunity to flesh themselves or their issues enough. It is a very good film, just not a great film, and I would love another cut of it (a director’s cut) which I hope one-way or other is released.  The film is also very funny, especially the scenes between Danny Aiello and Chris Klein and the film'n's opening.   There’ is a lot to love with Silver City. Silver was released in the US in October 2005. The DVD was first released on February 28 014  and it is out on the market in both the NTSC and PAL formats.  It was also released in the UK on May of this
years ago, you won't forget these guys. The original hard punk rock sound, the look, the attitude, the action & energy is all there. The film has been shot in 5 countries and has 3 different languages in it. It's a film about friendship and brother-hood, it shows us the life on streets, in squats, punk clubs, shows, gigs and how it' s like to be in a street punk band. All the actors are real punks. They'll take you back to that era and time, and they' ll make you remember those wild, hard and crazy days, which were so long gone. If you were there or you were never there, you won't be indifferently. The film tells us a true rock & street punk life. It'll make you remember some things from your old days, or will inspire you with your new life. It' a film you want everyone to watch it. The film contains 3 original sound songs of the band: "Living In This Jail, "Living In A World, and "Human Being." It is a film for everyone, and you're the one who decides who you want it. It's just like life, you can change things. You are free. So if this kind of film, or music style doesn' t interest you don 't watch this movie, but if they do watch this movie, then
go through each part of the book one byone but I don’’ want do spoil it, if anyone hasn`’t seen it. The book is really good and it would be a hard book do film because it`t’s a very personal experience and everyone experiences it differently. I’t really good movie and it was done a good job, but the book was better and it was harder for me to relate with certain things in the movies. I would give this movie a 9 because of what you`t miss when you haven"'' read the books and also how it was done in terms of the storyteller. There are so many great quotes from it and I`t’’ just as interesting to hear them. It was good that I got to experience this in a way that most wouldn"’ and I’d say it was a 3.6/10. I can”’t believe you`t miss 7. It’e’ so different from every part of this movie and it was such and eye. There”'ve been a few times I have seen this movie and you can really get into it. I don't like how they do it but they do it really, and this was one of the best. I`’d give it 3/10. I was really impressed with how well they got it out. I think they did it really well. The book is very good and the
production team was clearly going somewhere in this episode - it just happened to arrive at a dead end. (See 'The Lonely Star' for more on this.) Still, there was enough here that this show had a future - if only a very short one. --Bob Stewart, 2010/11-04"The Lone Star' was the fifth episode of the second production block of the third season. The episode was written and coauthorded, and directed and coauthord. 'The Last Hurray" was the sixth and final segment in this episode. The original aired on CBS- TV. "The Last Hurrah is the last segment of the episode 'The Last Hurrah". The last segment of the episode has the characters, including their children, attending an event at the park. The episode was produced by Robert Kulish and directed by David E. Kelton. The original music was composedby John Deblanc and performed by the orchester of The Music Center of America at Lincoln Center in a performance conducted and arranged by David E. Kelton. The episode featured the music of Bob Dylan. 'A Night With the Stars"' was a comedy-drum-comedy series featuring the stars of television and movie. The original series was produced at Lincoln Studios, a production studio in Los angeles, California. The studio was owned by the Walt Discovery Company who owned and operated it with Discovery Communications
also felt the plot was well thought out to be entertaining. The movie starts with a group or people of a similar mindset, who want to be a hero and the ending of the hero. The movie goes back and shows where each person came and the journey it took to get where each character is. It was interesting for it to show how much each person changes. I found the movie to have the perfect combination on comedy and serious, which is why I loved the film and would recommend others go out to watch it also! I loved the cast of this Movie too! It made the movie more entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I will definitely watch it over again. Thanks to Netflix for bringing this Movie. The film stars: Chris Pratt. Bryce Dallas Howard. James Cox, and Jeffrey Wright. 5 1/2 stars!!! ⭐️ I give it 6 Stars. (Netflix) -Mary Ann Riordin. I was not paid for this review. These words are mine and mine only!

Takashi Shimura' directorial debut, Ichiryo (The Inugamis), a.k.a., The Crucified (10/26), in the flash-back sequences which make up the bulk of the narrative (aside for brief prologue and coda). A mother and her daughter, who lives in a small town on the island of Shamakuni (Shinshu, in real life) in 1998, are hauntingly stalked in their home, which is in the final throes of being abandoned in lieu of a new high rise. In the first film, there was a young boy on a ferry, who sees a little ghost girl and is soon killed in a gritty, bloody death sequence. Here, there' is no real death, but we are introduced to our main characters, Reika (Miho Shiraishi) a teenage girl, whose mother (Misako Wataka), and brother (Kai Inowaki), live in the house. Inowaka' brother (who looks like he's 30, but plays a kid, like 9 or ten), and his mother are constantly fighting, and there is the usual "abandoned house" clichés, such that, Reiko, the daughter, begins to have strange, ghost related dreams, which we soon discover are flash backs. In the second act the family
like this is the first movie to get it wrong; I can recall "The Godfather" and "Gandhi" taking enormous liberties, but I can also recall the same people complaining about those and now being upset at the same things in other movies, just because they were more recent releases. So let's keep our heads here: this is a film, not an historical account. That being the case, I can easily overlook the many injustices done, as long at the movie itself stands on it own, and I think this does. It helps to have some knowledge of the historical characters and setting, but then that would have to apply to almost anyone, and even then, this is still an enjoyable film and well worth the watch, even if you're aware that some of the history is not exactly accurate - which is why I can watch it over and and again, and always enjoy it. (and the DVD has some interesting featuretics for those who want to know more about how history played out.) There are a lot of films that have been made of this time in Russian history that are less enjoyable. Even if you take it for what if is, a movie, this one stands as one of the best. (and there are many, some better than the others, like the "Alexandrovsky Trilogy" and some others I'll have reviewed soon.) I'm looking at all the reviews I'm writing, and I
was intruged by their name, so when a VHM disc appeared on e-Bay I pounced upon and snapped it up without reading the description. When it arrived I was disappointed to discover that the two films contained were made in France, but I decided to watch them anyway. Both are from 1899 and I have to wonder how they managed to get away with such an amount and level (at this time!)of nudity. In both the male lead removes the female character’s clothes (in one case by force) leaving the girl to run about the countryside, with her breasts exposed and bottom visible for several seconds, while the male tries to catch them before a rival cat-ches up with them! In the other she is stripped in a barn and chases around a field, also with breasts exposed and bottom visible. I can see why this would have made audiences of 1900 gas and giggler, it’s certainly not something I expected from films from the period! As for the films in other-words? Not great really, although the second one has some very amusing bits and pieces in. I was disappointed to find that the only other British Crazy Gang title on VHS was this one. I can see I’m now going top have to track down any Crazy Gang films on French DVD! I’ll leave links in the comments below. I can’’s imagine many of
coming but they are all variations on the same idea. I guess they can’t help it: it’s a great story. But I’M sick and tired. Why are they trying so hard to make it different? Why aren’? They just need a really good, faithful version. And they can’? It’ll just make people go to the theatre because they want a different version. It? Just go and make an animated film with the same story and let people watch it over and over again on TV and it’? The story is the same. And why are they trying to change it and make us go out all of a time? It makes the story even harder to understand and we can’?.? It just seems silly to do that and waste money.? It? It? Why not make it a bit better but keep on the same story? But it’? That would just be too boring. It’s just silly. It? The story would just be the same. It’? I don?t want to go to the film and see it. Just go home and watch TV on your own? It. Why don, they want to be original or something? What’? But they?ll never be able to? It? It’s just really stupid. What’? It’s not like Christmas is that important? It?. Just the same old story.? And they keep doing different versions of? I just? It
off the rails,people die.and the movie does not break any cinematography ground.what makes it better than a majority of the genre,are the characters.in any given slashing the characters are cardboard carnie cut-outs.in these movies,the actors usually have no clue why they are in the film.i was surprised this time around,the main characters are actually acting.there is a story that is developed,and it does not go for shock and gore at all.in fact,the gory stuff in the movie, is not that graphic.it is there and effective.but i was impressed with this movie and surprised that it was so good for the type of movie that it actually is-not a good movie,mind,but a better one in the genre that it is part of.i was surprised that a slasher flick actually had some substance.there is a message here in a very subtle manner,and that is good to have in the sub text of a slasher flick,i like it.in all it was a good watch.i recommend it,especially for slashing fans.6 outa seven.7/10.give the slasher genre a watch for a different view.if you have the stomach and time.this film was better than what i expected.and i am glad.7/10 for me.i liked it.i am glad.this was good.
. It is the late eighteen hundred's in New York City when the movie began; Michael's father was a firefighter, but he died on one occasion. When his family was in trouble he went to the fire station. The chief of the firehouse asked him for a few days. If he was good at his job he'll be a full fire-figther, if he'll fail he's out. Michael became a fire-ghiter, but he was a good one, even he saved a child once. When he got back to his family they were happy, but his mother wasn't. The mother told Michael the family is no good with a dead father, that'll kill the family, they'l go bankrupt one day and they'll be homeless. Michael's brother was a thiefe but the mother loved that guy very much, she said he was a "good boy". Michael wanted to make that family better but he didn,t know where to. One night he came to work late, he fell down a few stories in the hole of a fire and he broke his leg. The mother took a little amount of the insurance money for the family to pay for the mortgage. Michael had to leave from his job. Later it turned that his mom took 900 dollars from it for her own use. Michael came back to the house and asked the mother where is the money. She said the money
it’s like a mash between Caberte 3D and Scream: there’ll be blood! A bunch of young idiotic college friends are on a camp outing to a remote forest (with a creepy old shack) in the middle-nowhere when one of them finds a tape recoder in a tree. What they don;t realize though, it belongs to a creepo who’s been watching them, recording on that recoder everty time they get near it. He’s planning to hunt his victims down, one at a aime, but when one of then escpares his murderous plan, he decides to go for all in one, killing all at the same night.

5th position while a white guy wearing a leather strap on is trying to shove an 8ft long speer up his ass, you are in for a huge let down. That’ll take a little more than a $189.00 to make it happen. So, let me make this clear from day one: “This” movie is not for you, and that would include you too. You should probably just go back and read my review of The Evils 2. This, on any other movie, I’d say is a good flick. I can’t really get in to the plot for the movie, as I don’t think that it’s all that important, but basically there was a murder and the main suspect is a guy named “Lerouge”. So, a guy that is probably named “Larry Leroy Smithers, jr” is hired by the rich wife of the suspect to follow the suspect. He doesn;t know this is happening at the time of course, as he’s being told that he’ll just need a ride and a couple of beers with this other dude “Bernard”. He does this, then he gets in on a whole lot more. So, I guess to make it simple, “Bernie” is a PI, and “Lerouge”, the guy that the rich, rich, white lady wants to know about is not
stuff I’ll be honest. It does have its moments. They have all learned some stuff and it’s nice seeing them get back together and get to the final confrontations with the Bigg Baddy’z. But the story feels like there’s just something lacking here and it’s a real struggle to get through this. You see, there are three main problems, and I’ll list these now. So you can judge for yourself. But, the first big one is that a certain someone is missing. The one who started it out and who was the best one. The one we were all rootin and cheerin for to win it all at one point and she just isn’t here. That’s not what I was lookn’ for in a follow. I was wanting everyone to be in this. And that someone is no where in here to be seen and it makes the movie lose all of that feeling we’ve come ta expect. The 2nd big one. And this is a biggie, is that they didn’ t get that one thing from the last movie that they were supposed too and that is just ridiculous that we got through this whole movie with no resolution of that and now this is the final one! But I guess that is what I’m expecting from something from the 90’s. And third one, is the fact that this just felt too long. It just dragged out and dragged and just dragged out
and it is a drama...but I just don´t like this film. It is just another story, nothing extraordinary. If this was a novel, the story would be interesting because the author could explain better the motivi, the characters are too simple, not too well developed or the author would make some comments to explain what happened or why. I am not sure why this was a good story in the eyes of the jury members or why did they give it an Oscar. I just feel bored watching it. The characters are just too much simplified, they seem more 2-dimensional. The film is not interesting to follow, it´d better to read a synopsis. I would only say that I am curious why was this film chosen among the others. Maybe there are more interesting and original movies out there, maybe it won an award in 9 countries, I just can´'t tell because I don' t live here. If you really don¨t watch much films, it is ok, otherwise it is not. If they want a story, they should at least make it interesting to watch, otherwise it is just a waste of time, and that´s what this movie was for my eyes. And there are still so many movies to watch, so I can pass this one for now, it is just 84 m. Anyway, it has been nominated and has won other awards, so it is up yo you to watch. Good Luck! I just
jump and scream. But not really. The movie, based on a Stephen  King short-read, stars  the always solid  Samuel  Jacks00 as the main  character, a disbelieving cyncial horror author who, for research purposes, is staying  the haunting hotel suite  in the story' s title, which is a room on  the 1140 th level (get the pun?) of the Dolphon Hotel in Manhattan. The movie' makers make sure we hear about the hotel' s many other ghost stories and haunting experiences. Then Mike Enslin, who has written books about other hauntings, has one of the most interesting  occurrenc es in his own hotel stay  on  record. But as he discovers the  horror of the room 14 03.  He finds himself  alone  and facing  his worst fears. But is  the hotel room haunted, as he suspects, or are the events happening in that  hotel room his  own paranoia and  mental illness taking over his life in the  final,  last act.  The movie is directed with competent  direction, as if it were one  man' s  short film  that he'  ll be proud of and  want to send out with a letter in the hopes it' ll get picked up. But the movie' s  storyline is weak
a pot. The other week I found it covered in little white flies. This was the third or forth plant I had seen this on. I sprayed it and the white flies were gone, but the next day the leaves started to curl and I thought, "what a shame, I am losing all my plants to white flies". A few weeks went by and nothing happened but the Dandelions that I pulled had a lot more flowers on the plants, than usual. Then I noticed the leaves of some of the plants in the pots were wired back. The plants were growing, but had no new leaves. And then the leaves started coming out. They were not normal shaped leaves. Then the flowers bloomed. The plants had been attacked, but now had new and larger leaves, flowers and a stronger plant. It was a strange transformation to watch. I am still not sure if the white flies were good or bad. I did see them on the plant, before the transformation. I know there are good insects out there. The white flies look like they could have been bad for the growth, but maybe not. I don"t know much. I do know, there are a few more plants that will be looking more like this, in the near future. I will have my camera and let everyone know when it' going to blooms! Thanks for looking. This is a new garden for 2600, the first flowers are in! More to
in his story creation, and is very skilled at creating a suspense thrill ride and making the audience feel a part of the action. The movie is very well directed, and has great acting. This is definitely a great thriller, and a must own for all of us who love a thrill ride. I loved the suspensiveness of the movie, the suspense and thrills and action, and the suspenseness of it. It was like watching a rollercoasters, and the suspensiveness kept me on my seat. This was a must own thrill ride, and a must have in my collection. If it is not part of your film collection then it should. This is the best action movie I had seen so many times, I just had this feeling that it was going to be the best movie of the season, and I was right. It is the best movie of all time, a must own for all action junkies. I have seen it many times now and it keeps getting better. This is a must own movie for all of you who like suspence and thrils, a must have in my collection.. This review originally appeared at http://movies.filmstudiofilmsreview.net. This movie was very well directed, and there is not even one scene that didnt keep you on the seat of the movie, and the action was amazing, you will feel like a rollercoaster and you will be hooked.
too much. Too many people on my screen, and I just don'T like to get overwhelmed. (I am also very sensitive to light.) I think the show would probably work great if you just turned on the subtitling for it and followed along. The story is good, though. I think it is a good show, it'd just take me a few months to catch up on it. It'd be a good thing to watch while doing something that keeps the mind and hands busy, but not so active so as to distract from watching. For me, I think watching it while sewing would be about right, though I can see a few people watching in the bath! I hope you enjoy the show and let me/us kn0w what you think of the show. Have a great day! -Amy. :) Ping me if I need help. :D ~A.R.G.- 14-August-21 10:AM UTC (3:AM EST) p.s. If anyone is looking to talk to me about something in private, I have a talk thread.

a few to go) and a good horror for its own right. It' not the scaring kind but it' is very entertaining and well made. The plot is a bit weak but the direction and the cast do everything to make up the lack. In particular Donald Sunderland and Oliver Reidy are excellent, and they play their roles well and with a lot of humor, while the young actors (Lisa Palfrey, Susan Penhrym and Jenny Hanley, in particular), are quite good (although they donâ?t have a very big part to play). The only flaw, in spite the many things this film does correctly, is in the very end: it's the only moment in which I had some difficulties in accepting what was shown on the screen. The last scene should be more effective and convincing. Overall I think "The Uninvitated" should be a must for anyone who're interested in old horror films. My opinion about this film is a bit divided: the direction is good; the acting, too, but there' is some lack of cohesivity and the ending is rather disappoint. Anyway it is a good film, worth of interest for those interested on this field. 10/31.11/21/2108.22:57.2019.12:16:27.11:1 8:37:38-
being so flawed it's just plain silly. And, I am not one for "it's just fiction so it doesn' need be logical" - it just needs to make sense, otherwise it' just dumb - and this one was dumb and it did not try to be funny. Not at all. I was just confused how could a group that was able to create a spacesuit from scratch that would function be so dumb in how they used that suit, how they went about things - even the basic science behind their plan was flawless. I am not even sure if it was supposed be funny, but the end result was just stupid. I was so confused how anyone could take this seriously. And, yes - it was obviously "based" on The Martian - and it was not as funny. But this one was just too much even for me :) I mean, how to you make something like going to Mars be unrealistically unrealistic? You just did it and ended with "hah - and you believed that?!" :)))) I guess I need to go and watch something else now! - and will do that soon. Just had a hard time getting through this movie, which is a pity. But at the very very very least they made it look nice. But still - it'd be nice to see that someone had actually done at least some research before writing this movie - if not just watched The Martians. Maybe even watched "The Mart
a tad like all three, only not exactly any one of them but all of these put together. This isn't the best film ever, nor will you see it on many Top Lists, but it still is one hell of a fun ride that will leave some smiles on the viewer. It also has a few things that don´t seem as much fun to a German audience. It´ll be fun to see it again someday, because there is still a lot to discover. And it does look really good. But let´s not get too serious. Müllerst Buro, is after all the film you go and see after having had a beer to get into a better frame of mind. And then have another beer after seeing it. And maybe another beer after thinking back on it. But it will still be fun. But now let´s see how that all fits together, shall I try to put it into writing, I have already been talking a great deal already haven`t ive...? The story is about Mühler and his friend, who is a police chief. But he gets fired because of Müller, but Müller gets fired as well. So they team together to start a private detective agency. And of course they are doing their job the best they can, with a great deal going on for them and a lot of people that they encounter, that could turn out as being very interesting to them. But
my youth. It came out when my parents first got satellite TV and I must admit I was skeptikal. I don’ think I had every really watched much sci fi, or any cartoons at the time. I had a bad experience with a movie called ‘The Watcher’ on the Sci fi channel. It was a made for T V movie which I remember my parents and a few of their freends renting a VHS copy and watching. The movie was terrible and my parents were so disappointed because my dad is a big sci- fi nerrd and the rest are also into fantasy. They said they never rented another one of those again. That’d be why they didn' t rent 'Star Trek - The Next Generation'. I don’ think that movie had a lasting impression on my parents but maybe it did. So I didn really want them to get a satellite TV because my parents never wanted to pay for it anyways. Then we got one. That was it. My mom said we had to get a dish, so my parents did and I’m sure my mother was very disappointed when it took 3 months for it get hooked up. I’ve been told the satellite guy is the worst and the most unre- liably guy ever. But when it did finally happen my mom was very impressed with how clear Star Wars is on the Sci fi channel, that was her first impression because it was the only thing she
of ‘Atoning’ was actually in this. So much could be done in this world. The film was a bit too long for this one, but it’s still a solid movie and I recommend it to anybody who loves the original. I have watched it a number times and it’ll probably be one of my favorites of the year. A lot of people were saying that the movie is too long, but I think it’s too short. It’’s the most boring thing I’ve seen, but that’s only part of the story. It was pretty much all over, but I still enjoyed it. The film was great overall, but I would have loved a bit more of the action. The action was great. I also think that ‘A toning’, ‘The Avenger’ and ‘Captian Americ: Civil war’ will have very similar themes of death and destruction. I also loved the fact that the movie has been released in HD. It’s nice and easy to watch the movie on a large screen TV. I would recommend ‘Atoning’, ‘The Avenger and ‘Captain America: C.A.S.S.’ to anybody who loves these movies. I think that the original movie was a much stronger and a very good movie. I also think the sequal to the ‘Avengers’ should be much better as well. It’’ a great movie and a great sequal. 89ce
porkos. If you want to be entertaing, have a good laugh, and not pay an obscure admission price, then this is the right flick for you. It is an extremely funny and light movie, and it has just the perfect amount of crude in it to keep you laughing. It is the kind you want the kids around to see, especially if they have not yet experienced the joie de vie of watching a movie like The Dirty Dozenn. In my opinion, you have to watch it. You have to, I promise. Just watch, and laugh. And then maybe you will want a sequel. I know you want me to keep going! And I will! But you have to watch the movie first. And it will make a better impression if you see the trailer. But do watch the movie before you decide whether or… not to. It just might change the way that you think of life and living! The Dirties is a movie about two friends who want to make something better of the situation they’re in. They’re the only people who can do it. This is a great flick. And it is not just the movie, but also the trailer for it. It is the whole thing. You have to see the whole trailer. But do see The Dirtys before making a final decision about it. It is a great movie, if you are not the type of person who has seen this movie before.
involving Mia being a superhero and everything have become very ridiculous. It'll be like, okay there'll some sort of villain and there will some sort or crime that needs to stop, and I'll be like, okay, I'll buy it, and they'll be the most unrealistic and cheesy and ridiculous things in a world of ridiculous things, so I get to the end where everything works out and the supernatural thing is solved and I'll be like...ok, I'm sorry, but, what? How? You'll say something like, oh, you mean it's not a real demon? and I'll be like...well no, it'll say something like it just wanted to test Mia to prove it could still fight, and I mean, I get it that Mia is super strong and fast and all that and she probably can kill people with one swing but it will be the dumbed down version, and then Manny or one the side cast or whoever will make an unreal and dumb remark and Mia will say no way and they can all laugh it up, because that' not how the world is. I mean the world is pretty ridiculous and the laws of physics have long since gone out the windows in this series, and the world is pretty much a joke anyway. but come on. I get it they're doing a cartoony show here, but the ridiculous
Besides the usual action and fight sequences, I could hardly find anything interesting in the storyline that kept me watching. Not that there was an uninteresting storyline. It just did not have a solid plot that could hold me up to the movie. The movie was more a bunch random events that happened to the lead characters without any logical explanation whatsover, and they would just move on from the story. The plot could actually had been better, but with no storyline, everything just seemed to be a waste of time to me. In addition, the story lacked some sort or purpose for the lead characters. There was nothing that gave reason to me why they did what the did. In some way it seemed like the characters did things for the fun of things. There was no point for them being around. The story seemed rushed with everything seeming to happen in such fast pace that there was no room for explanation. The only thing that kept my attention was the characters themselves because of their star power. The story did try to give an explanation for the main character by showing his life as an orphange and how he came from nothing and made it to the place at which the main character had. I think it would had worked better with a different approach on the storyline. Overall, this movie is a complete waste of Pacinos' time and I don' know what he was thinking when he did this, but it sure was not for the storyline. It was more
some parts. Well I was very very surprised with the story line. When you read the title you would think a horror flick. No, the movie is more a story of revenge and the bad karma that follows. You see R.J. Hamilton as a man who is wrongly fired from a job. He is not a happy man and is a bit crazy. He kills the 2 men and takes the 3 daughters with him to his island home to live the rest on his days in peace. Well it is a little hard to get that way when the girls find out he killed their parents. The girls decide that they are going to leave and try to get help. One tries but doesn' really get anywhere and the last one makes the mistake to tell R J Hamilton. The story then takes some more turns. I will not go into any further. You just need to watch this one. I do love the ending where there are many surprises. Well I do recommend that you should see this 1 but not if you are under the legal viewing age. As for the actors, they all do a good job. The story is very good and keeps your curiosity going. There really are no boring parts. I would watch this one again and again and again...... I hope you will too. Enjoy. (1984) 2006 2005 1997 204016 2.55
beats and an incredible cast. And to top it off with some amazing acting. This movie is just so much better and more entertaining then all the movies I have watched in a long long time and I am glad I have seen this movie because of all of these reasons and the fact that I have never seen a movie like this before. You can' really ask any more from any movie. I really hope they make a lot of other great movies like this because I know this one would be a huge hit. I can't recommend this enough. I hope you all go see and enjoy it as much and as much as you want. I'll be the first one back in there for sure!!!! And I love that they are all the same cast!!! This is just awesome! And you can really feel every beat and every emotion of every single actor in this movie. The story is also very well written. The script was very interesting and well done and the characters were all very well written too. I really enjoyed the cast and their great performances. The story is very well written. This story is very good and it's a very well written story and it will be very entertaining and very good movie too!!! I just loved this one and I hope it' s made. It's just amazing!!!!! Great movie!!!!!! It really was!!!! I loved this!!! I hope they make more movie like it!! It really does deserve to be made and be on the screen as soon
give a damn, we wouldnít have a planet. if we didníte care about the planet, iíte be a planet of shit! she says as i say: i think you're right, i've never thought about that before. i think that people are very selfish, very self-centrered. and i also know that i'm the most selfish self centered person i've met. but i know that i've been selfish since my birth. you know, like, when i'd take a toy from my younger brother as a kid. but it'st a selfish world. we doníte even care about the world we live in, but the one that we die in is the one we care about the most. so we have to start caring about our planet. you know, it takes one person to be an activist, but it takes a whole country to be an activists, and it takes a whole planet to be an activists. like the earth, that we walk on, we walk on. and the earth that the trees are growing from is that we walk on! and it is the earth that grows us in the womb of a woman! and this is that we walk on, the grass. we walk it on and it walks it on. we walk and it grows... we walk it on and we walk. you can't do without it and it can'to without us. so weí
only one night, where in fact, a demon is present. But the title of the movie is The Haunt of The Black Mamba, so I guess the Night of The Demons title was the closest that they got with their budget. This was a late night B movie on the SyFY Channel, which I guess would now just be called "SyFy" now. That'd just be so stupid. And it was on late night, so it was a pretty low budget production. But not so low that there wasn't lots of nudity and boobs and blood and gags and that's what I was watching it for. I mean, it was a late night Saturday night and the only thing on was this and Ghost Hunlers. I wasn’t going anywhere. I was in my room. I was alone, just the way that I like it. And I was going to watch this movie until the end because I knew it was going nowhere. This movie was about a bunch a young kids, mostly female and with the exception on maybe two or three, were not attractive. So I wasn’t watching the boobs, I wasn’t really watching the gory scenes (except for one where a dude had his head split open with a shattered wine bottle). And while the acting wasn'...Read the full review. More info at our website, and if anyone wants to send me a movie to watch and review, please contact
able to clone a human child before too long. This is the story. He is also very interested, and very attracted, by a young girl in his lab who is working for him as well. He asks her to go to a basketball court and play hoops one day. As she runs in her jeans he looks at the back pocket and sees it is bulging. He asks her and finds a copy of the genetic sequence she’s been working on – and he’ve been working on the exact copy. They compare notes and he tells him to look at his and compare it. He tells her she’s a good girl, but he’s also a great guy. The two fall into an awkward embrace. They talk more and she asks what she is working on for him. They are a great fit and she is a great person and they are both looking forward. She asks him about himself and asks if there’a any way he can get some time alone and get a little privacy. She asks about the fetal research he’d been studying and his lab work for the last two years, and he tells her that he’s been studying human genetical sequence and cloned human children. She asks him if he’ll be willing, and he says of course. She asks about the clones and how he feels and he says it’d probably be a good time for me and my friend. She tells me we could take a few days to do
’ve been.  It does however have quite the cast of familiar faces:  Bill Murray (Bill Murray is in a lotta stuff, so that’ll be my excuse for not listing every instance in the future – he’ll be in my “other roles I haven;t gotten too” list), Adam Scott, Chris Pine (Star Tekk…err, Trekk?), Jason Schartemman (who’s been in the last few Marvel fllix that you may have enjoyed) and so very, so many more.  It also had a little too much in the way or racial jokes, but I guess that’s to expected in some form or another when dealing with Bill Murray.  But all and all it seems like something I can see myself sitting down, putting in on in background, and getting other stuff done.  6.5 stars  – 7.0 stars.  The movie is called Rock of the Aggies.  I’ve included one of my personal favorite trailers to the movie “Dinner for Schmuckos.”  You may or may not agree with me, but you can still enjoy it.  😉  Enjoy!  Later – KW.

that didn’ t have a great songwriting team in the 4-5 decade of their own musical theatre and make it seem to be as fresh and entertaining as this.  It’ll be hard since there’ s only three songs in the whole evening in English and all three songs were done with the composer, the orch. arranger on board and the cast of actors who have all become accents and mannerisms and physicality. (It is a very fine ensemble of players.  This must seem like home to them and it looks very much like a home to them –  there they are – they’re all on stage, seated, and it looks like home and they look happy there.  So does the audience – they are a very good audience. They are sitting around the edges of the stage – a few rows of seats and then the orch pit and beyond and beyond – it looks like the theatre they grew with. I don ‘ want to be a party pooper.)  It’s hard not to feel that what we see and hear is their version of a good time and it’s hard for an audience in this country to make it theirs.  It’s like a foreign film – I’ll enjoy it but can’t imagine it’s being released. (Exciting that it’ll go on tour.  There was a line on the program that said it will go on to tour in Europe, Asia and North

There’ll be a few out there who want to get the job down, there will only be one man who can. He’ll be the man who’s always on the edge of the crowd. He has his own code. He knows the way of the gun and what it means to be a man. He is The Last American Cowboy. I am that man. I will not back down, I will not give up. I am the Last American Out Law!

the Catholicism of my homeland (Mexica). But that is not a reason not watch this movie. Is a great story, the story of all immigrants. You could find your parents in this movie, your own history. I love the way that all characters are connected in some way. This movie make me think that we don´ t need a border. In the middle of a movie, you start to see how it is to be an illegal immigrante, and to do a lot for your own family. The director express very much the idea of that. This is her opinion. And I love it. The movie is about the border, but it also talks about the other sides of the border. I am very sure you are going watch it more than one time. 10 out of 5 stars if possible! 07-02-20.

the story is old, but the tale still has a moral. These men weren' think the king would pay what he was offering. So they went and recruiting other people to help. But the king only wanted them. When they went to the king and told him what they had done the king said, "No. You are to take the job yourselves." The reluctance of the king' heroes was costing him money. But it was the same with the reluctance in the hearts of the men. The king' men were not the only ones being cost money by their unwilling spirit. The reluctance of these men was keeping them from what they wanted. If that isn t a paralle to what happens in our daily walk of faith I don' have a clue what it could mean! So here' story about these men and the dragon. But let me remind us all. We have a dragon to slug as well . . the dragon of un-forgi ness! (Jer. 5) This story, written by Charles Swindol, is the account, "The Relu nant Heroes Who Slug A Dragon." Enjoy! "Once there were two men working for the same company on two different floors in the big building at the end of the road. Both worked very hard. In spite of their different job responsibilities, both men loved to talk about how their work was important and how their work was very demanding and exhaustible
the characters and the sets are a great mix, the cinematography is excellent and so was Duvall. It' a movie you would have wanted to watch at least another hour to get more into it. The whole movie is filled with small details that you need to see twice because, while you think you know where the movie is heading, it takes a turn you weren’t expecting. The film is filled to the top of small details, so it’ not like you are expecting a big reveal. It’ a slow burn. Altman’ s film is an excellent movie in terms that is a bit of an acquired thing. Some might love this because of the small details and you need to watch it a number times to really get it in the end. The movie isn' a traditional one that you can say this character did that and so on or this happened, but it has a bit more of a different approach. I think it’s not an easy movie to get, but if you can, you’ll get a gem that might not be for everybody but for those it will. I think this is a movie you’re not gonna understand on your very first sight. It needs some time and a few more viewings to get the full idea. In the end I liked it more than I didn’ really like but I don’t know if this is the movie I would watch over time, but I really do want to watch it again and see if what
and it struck such a chord in the kid me. I still think this movie is one of the best ever. And I can relate with the character of the girl and her relationship (or not) with the teacher... I also find this movie very funny, in parts, very very very funny...and I still find it moving. I am watching it for the second time right before it hits theaters here in France again. I have to tell ya that some of what was going in the kid me's head back then...I am surprised that some things never changed in me. It'll make sense once you see (or re-discovered) the movie. And, as you are all aware (but I'm not sure they were aware in France that this would have been made into such a big hit) it became one on my first favorite movie ever, that would be my introduction into cinema art as a whole. And I've been hooked since then. I know that, back in the 50ies, it made quite a fuss, and it still does now, but I don't really care about all the negative criticism (the teacher/student issue, I guess). It is one of the masterpiece in the history of movies, that'll be remembered and watched forever. And that is a promise. :) (And it is the best movie that I'll have discovered in my first decade on this earth. It'd
highschool. My sister is the one who first showed it too my brother, dad and mom, and we just fell it loved. My mom even went out to get the movie so she could watch and we could watch with the family. The movie is a really good movie, it has adventure, romance, humor and action. It has soo many good quotes. One that I like is "I've been waiting twenty years for some little jerk to say that". It also has a lot a good songs, one that I like to listen is "Somewhere in Time". Also, one thing that I didn't know until recently was the actress in this movie, Jane, also played the actress that was the main lead actress in "The Never Ending Story". It is a really good film, I recommend it to anyone who is going through a rough break up because in the end everything works its way out, and it's a nice movie to watch and it's a classic movie. This movie will always hold dear to a lot a lot to my heart. It was made in 86 and it made 30 years later. It was directed by Robert Zempel. I hope you like. Please share you feelings or what you think of this film. Also if anyone wants a video of the scenes from it. Please tell. Also if you don' t want a video. Thank You and take care!!!!! Please share! Thanks! :D :)
by the time I would have reached the end. The whole scene of the guy eating the face off that person was enough and I think I would have stopped watching after a bit. I mean you would start getting ideas about things that you shouldn;nt be and it would be like you could see everything that had happened and you couldn;'ve unseen it. That is my opinion. I think "Silience of Lamb" is good but I would not have watched it all. I might not even be watching "Silience" now. Maybe I will see the other 3 movies and tell my friends to come over and we will watch the 4 movies and see how much we can take! Hah! I am not sure why I even said that! Hah! Have fun with all this talk about Silence!

sense. There is the most incredible level of moral relaivisism here, a complete lack of any sort of ethical stand. We are presented by a man who has murdered his wife, a man who has been in prison for 18 years, and a man (a judge) who is trying desperately to convince this monster that it would serve us all better if we did NOT kill this mass murdering psychopath. (This Judge is one who is also a murderer, having killed someone in the line of duty.<p style="padding:10px;">He even goes as far as to make a "mistrial" of sorts, in order to help this guy. It is beyond belief, this guy is nothing other than an evil, evil person. Yet, he is treated as though there is no real moral imperative. If you don&#0227;ve done your job right, you are a criminal. It is beyond belief. The man, in his mind thinks there is no evil in him at any level, and he is presented as an innocent person.<br/>This film just goes to prove that you really can be anything that you want to be. Even if it means that you are the most horrible, heinious person that could possibly exist on a human scale..<div class="discussion"><p>I give this film zero out of five. It really is the most represantative film in the
the costuming and the performances which were more like those found in the theatre than in cinema. Then I began to appreciate how the film was structured into chapters, as if you were watching a series of skit scenes in different places and times but somehow still connected. As each “choreopoem”, “musical playlet”, and “saga in song” unfolds you discover how the past and present are connected. I love the way the music was woven into the film and that each of the actors/singles are so incredibly gift at singing and acting as well and that every one of them can sing. The cinematic experience also has a “live” theater quality because you get to see so many people, so much diversity and so many different stories. It was also interesting that many scenes were set in church and that a church sings and danced and celebrated God in this film too. There are several songs that I loved: “Lift Every voice and sing”, “God’ God God”, “Gone”,”Lost in the world”. and “I’m going down (I know you don’ t want me around) “. In fact there are too many songs that I love to list in this post but they all make an impact. I think this could be a great film to watch with a group and start discussions about race in America and the past and future and what it’s like to be different and how we as individuals
accent. I'll be honest, I'll always think that' it is not the best movie ever made, but for pure entertainment it was a very good film. And the cast was brilliant (Jack Lemmon won his first academy Award here). The movie is set up like an old style comedy/situation comedy. And the situations that happen in the movie are hilarious and I have to believe, that if they were real, they would be funny. I mean really. I mean what is a better laugh then watching a guy go into a mental ward thinking it is a hotel???? And the whole scene with Lemmon and Dino in the ward room was just perfect. But the whole thing was perfect and the fact that the main character was a homosexual, was not even that funny, it was just something to be made fun of. Like most 59's comedies. But this time around, it was done brilliantly! If you like classic Hollywood comedy you might wanna give this one the try, because I'll tell you, it is one funny ride. You' ll be enterted for the whole two hour film! And don't worry about Jack Lemon, I'm pretty sure he can take it, after winning two awards for best actor. And he deserves it, the guy is a natural comedienne! The only downside is that Dino was too young to be his real age, I would have preferred a guy
be shown in my local town.  The film, starred the much loved British actors Sir John Gieldgud, John Malkoich, and Sir Aleid MacGawn, and was directed by Ronald Neamed. The plot concerns five men of varied ages, social background  – all with varying attitudes to women – who share the experience on the night before their departure for battle.  The film was made in 1944, in war-time London, and many of its scenes depict wistful and nostagic images of an earlier London.  There is a lovely scene of an all-nigh party taking tea in the park before setting out on the march, where the old soldier’a (Geldigude) is reminded by his old army mate (MackGawn) to ‘watch the clock’ – it being very much against the army rule to take tea in a park!. This was followed by the scene of five soldiers singing in a line, to the delight and amazement of a couple on a bicyc, riding by. I love this scene, but also that in the film where they go to the fair at Pett’s Wood, and see the funfare attractions – the fair-ground is, of coarse, long since vanished,  but the fun and laughter remain with us all the years. It’ is a film that is not solemn about the reality or serious consequences of
as more poles apart from the amateurish than most big budget films. The film tells of the evil that comes forth when Halloween hits the town, with kids going trick or treating and people dressing up to go to parties and dance, and the people that are not in costume that become victims of some very bad things. There a lot of things that go on that are unbelievable in such a film and a lot more that is just not right. For one, I was not buying the fact the whole story took place on one night, it is simply not possible for what happens in that one day to happen and take place as it were. There really is no need to try, and that in itself should be a clue to how poorly this was made. But, I digres…the plot is about two kids who run into trouble when they stump into the house in the middle of the neighborhood of where no one has ever been seen before, or ever will again. A young boy and his sister go to the neighborhood to trick or treating and the boy gets the idea that it will look cool if his sister comes along, but they end of going into more than they bargined for. Once there they meet the owner of this haunted house, who has a few secrets of his own. This man is none too thrilled about the kids being in his domain and tells them to stay away. The young boy however finds this intriguing and the two kids end up going
enjoyment in a theater in quite a bit. Not so much from Red Eye, but the theater. My theater is an Arlington Theater and it shows movies on the biggest screens in town, which is a good thing because I don' have to deal as much as the other movie-goin' folk. However my theater also is filled by high school kids that talk loudly the entire time and have sex with their girlfriends in the front seats (not kiddiung). So I was excited to see my new movie in the theater that is in another city, 40 minutes away. I was in heaven because the entire theater wasn' even half as filled as my home turft. It was great. Now onto the film, it was good, but I thought it was kind of a rip off of Panicked. I mean it was about someone who has been in a plane wreck, gets on another plane to the airport of where this accident happened, only for him to be the next target for a bombing! It was good, but the acting wasn so hot, the girl that played Lisa Reisert is the only one who actually got my interest, but the guy that played the main man, was just bla and boring. And then the ending was just so obvious, they didn' do any work on that part I was really disapoointed. Anyway, go watch Panicked and see how it' compairs. I give this one a 
impossibilities in what happens. This isnít even ďA Hard Dayís Night.ď The Beatlemania of 13 years ago is replaced now by a few ďyeah yeah yeahsĒ and a couple 10-second clips. This is the kind of movie where you can see the actorís mouth move out of rhythm to what heís really singing, and where the lips are so out in front that even a ďmovieĒ fan can catch it. And itís so bad, even the 10 seconds of real footage are not enough to make you want more. Youíd really have to be a hardcore, obsestive Beatlemaniac not to see this for what this is: a big, stinking, cheesetacular, moneygrubbing, lowrent, cashcow, piece of schlock. And even if you are the biggest and hardcore Beatlicious freak, it wonít make it any easier to sit through, and you wonât be able watch without wanting more of the real thing. And you wonât be able to watch it for any reason other than for the fact that it was made about the greatest musical phenomenon of the last half a billion millenia, ever. And you wonât really like it. And you wonít really understand what youíve just seen, or what happened. But you will be saying, ďThat can be the last Beatles film I
, one that makes you wish you had the remote. The writing sucks - and there is no chemistry or anything remotely interesting...not to say the first two Buffy series didn' t have the same shortcomings...but at the end it was just so much better. In general, it sucks, and the last few episodes were horrible. I guess they'll try to make us believe Sarah had something in her eyes...or maybe she had something in her eyes...but the rest of the series was just horrible. I'll miss the cast and crew, but not the series...which is a shame. I just hope the rumors about a Fire Fly spin-off are true. I can's believe this is how this great series dies, or how it ends. I guess we'll just find that on E for a few years from now. The only good thing about this is Sarah. She's gorgeous and she's the one who has to save the Buffyverse (and Jasmin is still one hot woman in my book.) This is a series for the true Buffy/Angel fans only. I would recommend that you only see it in its first run...not to waste the time. I have to give it 2-stinkers. I can only give them a point for Sarah. If it had been anyone but Buffy...it would only have been the best series ever. I can't really say that because
be very good. But I found myself really likable characters. I liked all three male leads. I thought it's a very well written story. I was really drawn into it. The only negative I have about it was the way that they showed the Indian attacks and how they were killed off. The Indians seemed to have a real vendetta about killing off white men. Also, I don't think it was needed to show the Indians shooting off the men that were trying. In the movie, you don't see the men trying so hard to run away from the Comanche. The men had no chance. It was just so unneccessesary to add that part of a scene. All the other scenes were great. I was just so drawn in with it and I really wanted it to be a long series. There is a lot of good things to say. You just have to see it for yourself! I would recommend it! It has great acting and I found the characters very likable. All in one word: Awesome! I would have watched it again if it was on television. I really enjoyed it, so I gave it a perfect rating. And I would also recommend it to any friends. If this was a series I would definitely have watched other parts of the series. I was really happy with this movie. I hope that the next two episodes will continue in the same way. It was just really good. It is very well worth the time
a twist...and another...and then the book goes crazy."  I think it might be worth another try in the evening. Or maybe tomorrow morning if it doesn't come to a natural stopping/cliffhange point.  <br>But, I can see why this is so polarizing. It'll probably make the top 15 or 20 most hated/loved list for 2011 (and I don't read much.) I can't even remember what book it was but it was #1 in a list and there were over 1,573 reader reviews (which is unbelievable and amazing) and 53% 1 starred...the rest was almost an almost equal spread of love or hate. I just couldn'9t remember the book and I thought that was because it's been awhile but now that I's remembered, it'd just another book with the love or/and hate split right down that almost 51/49 line...or was that 52%. Anyway... <p>Picked this up at the recommendation from a good buddy who likes my favorite stuff. I was excited. I have not been this excited for a thriller since I read "Lose You For Good" by John Grisham. I have not read any Gris since then, but that one was so compelling I was
about the film seems forced and I don’ t see the movie at all. If I have to rate it, the movie deserves not more than 2 stars. The movie is based upon the popular bestseller by James Cameron, who was the writer of the movie and he does an average job in it. He is not an actor, but he is good in playing a role of a prophecy. The story of this biblical film revolve around a man named John Smith, an ex – FBI Agent, is sent to the Vaticen to help Pope Gregory XVI to protect his life. He has to protect the life of the Pope as well as to save his country from the terrorism. The whole story is about John’ s struggle to save his beloved Pope. When John is appointed by Pope Gregory XVI in the Vaticn to protect his beloved brother, the terrorists of the world are planning a bomb to explode a Vatical church. But when they succeed in their plan, it becomes a major issue for the Vatic and Pope Gregory to solve the problem as soon. John is able to rescue his friend in a nick time with some help from an American doctor. But he is soon sent to a mental hospital, to keep his mental health. But when his brother’s life becomes endanger again. He starts to think that everything was done by the Pope. John’s struggle to protect his brother from a terrorism attack and to protect
Ridiculously, this movie has been described in the UK as being ‘in the no-ironic tradition’ – I do not quite think that is what no-ir is about but the point still remains that this is not a traditional ‘noire’. What it does remind you a little bit of, is ‘Mementi’, and ‘Se 7en’, although even these two, are far more subtle and intelligent films that this. The whole ‘noiresque/noir-like’ genre is not really doing anything for itself at the present time – I would suggest watching, and enjoying, the original films, instead of these half-heartened attempts, with this, being one of the biggest disappoints. A very slow start (the opening title sequence is quite good) and it does have a few decent scenes (some good shots of Chicago), the script is not great and, as mentioned above – far from original and it feels like it is lacking any true originality. The whole premiss does not seem that original either, but it is the way they have gone and handled the movie which makes things so frustratating – they have missed a whole host of opportunities to make this a really great film. I can imagine the director sitting in a dark, drenced room and thinking, yes, this is really noiresque – but it doesnt quite work, the whole thing is too bright and too clean and it lack any real tension – the only
a language which is so unique, only a fraction of the population can understand it fluantly. But with a 20 million budget, it does a lot to make sure all the money is shown. And there is a lot shown here... The special effects are good. And there is an overload of them for sure. The film is about a man who is being chased by a secret group who want him dead. And his little boy. What I liked is, for those who are familiar of the genre, is the fact it's done so fast, so quick, you can't catch your breath. But that'a not all. The story is told in a way no other Quebec film has ever done. The camera is so close to the characters that it'll give anyone a head rush. But with the fast editing and the way it is told to the viewer, it all adds up into the suspenseful film it is. The story is simple, but well presented, and for sure, it's one to watch. The music is fantastic too! A great action/thrilling film. 78%. A true must. And for you Quebecois, this is a definite recommendation! If you speak the language, that is. You should be able. If your a fan like me though, I'm pretty much sure the language will not be a problem. A must for everyone though. And the film itself was not a
guy with glasses is the same scene Goodfellz copied almost shot-for-shot. It'a a classic and I'm glad it was finally released for the home theater. The only flaw of Ridley'Scotts version was the soundtrack, it was just wrong. I can't really see the point to releasing a special DVD of the original director cut, I thought all the scenes were already in there? Anyway it was a good choice to have an uncut version released at last. 7.5.10.1005/01/05 2011.10.1.16.30.30.30/01/08 27/013.60.1.16:30:30 ----------------------. 08 09 ------------------------------.010/02.82.82 82.8245.30.45/5 2019 07/29/01/09/21/50/25/04 2021 09 13.32 0:32 -----------------------------3.43.81 3.49.15 3.5533666/37355 8.1
is an engaging, fast moving film. Here are some good quotes from it: (SPOIERS, I GUESS) Eddie: "I'll never understand you, you know, with the way the world works and how everything is. How can a man have enough of one thing and need more of another all at the time?" Dr Lowe: I'd be a dead if I told him anything. I mean I didn t think I'll ever have enough of the woman you love, but that don't make them good for us! I'll never have her again, now! Now I got no more of her! You know what they got for me, now? Just enough time, to die." Eddie (on the radio) "I'm a dead m-m-man. I'm a dead, mmm, man! I can tell you, you'll never be a man, if your life isn't lived to the br-br-br. Br-br. Br-br-br-br. BR-BR, you can tell me I'm the m. I m a dead man! I'll never be able, to tell anyone, what to tell you, you know, but I'll tell, you the truth, about how I feel, about it!" Lowe (after being killed for talking): You can go out and get your own girl, but I'm not
and the troops leaders are killed. He is forced into it, but he comes to enjoy helping the boys grow into fine young scott men. Along his journey he finds his own life changed, but is it for the best? Can he keep himself under wrap in a place of his heart that he never knew he had room in until now. Will the boy in the red t-shirts be able to help the man out of his comfortability or will he be left with the feeling that this was a good deed gone bad? Find out in this wonderful short book. I received an autograhped copy in return for my honest opinion, I found it an interesting story. It was one you can read in a few minutes, but I found there was quite a bit between the lines. You really get to know the man behind what he is doing in this book. The shortness of it does leave you wanting more, it is a bit like a cliffhangaer, but I think it leaves enough to the imagination to enjoy what is happening. I would have to give this book two and a half, to  three thumps up!! 🙂 You have a good story, that leaves you wanting, but leaves you happy with what is happening!

the movie, and it really feels like you are part of this wonderful story about the witch. In fact, the costumes for the main characters of the movie was very good, while the extras was also good but not as good. The hair of the main characers was also excellent in this movie, and I was very impressed by the way this movie used the costumers and the makeup. The costumes are also very good, especially for this kind movies, and the hair on the actors is also great. This is a great way to have a movie like witch, and I think it was very good to make a movie like this. This is the kind movie I like, the one that can be seen without any kind of problems. I think that this movie is very well filmed, because the costumery is very well done, there were no major problems with the costuming, and all the details were done very well, with no big flops, and all this makes it even a lot better. This is a movie about a good story and not just a movie about a movie about a story in the movie, and I was also impressed that all this costumed was done by people who are not only a good actor, but a good costumer too, I think. I have to admit that I am not a fan of witch, but the good thing about this film that it has a good story and a good cast. And the costuming is also
the meter at the 8 rating. This has got to be one of my favourite movies. The story is good, the acting, especially of Alisan and Robert, the direction and editing superlative. The cinamatographer and director of photography (John A. Alonso) was also the photographer of The Breaking of Sharky'a Heart. I have seen many movies but this one has the best cinematic quality. The music is great, too, but the highlight for the whole movie for me are two scenes: when Darlene and Shark are sitting on Shark's boat and when Shark and his son are on a ride on an amusment park. Alison Porters performance in the former scene, Robert's in front the latter, make a great impression. This movie was never a block- baster, which might be one of the factors for the low ratings. I am happy I was lucky to find this DVD in a local movie store and can watch it now at my leaisure. The ending is not very strong, but the whole movie was good. This would have been an excellent candidate for the 21 Grames Award. The music in this was very well chosen. Alison' s and the little girl (Kelly Preston daughter?) who played the little sister were perfect. I am still amazled by the way Robert and Alison could make you believe that they really loved one another on
Rhames as the shady drug baron. The plot was weak, unbelievably weak with a twist in the end to try to make it better. And they really made me feel bad about my own love life. I mean these two guys are so in love, they go out with other women and even have thresomes with them and then when they see eachother they are like "Hey, what've u's doeen wif ur new boyfriend?" This is so sick. This is not real men! I'd rather see a gay p*orn with two real men than these two pansy boys who have sex, but are just in love enough that their boyfriend would be pissed when someone else would be doing it with someone elses. So I would not recommend seeing this film. But if u do, try not to think about the main characters as real people, and you might get something good. Also I recommend not bringing the one you love with you to see ths movie! :D:mad::P:mad::D::D:D:D::D:D:D:D::P::D::D! ::D::D ::P::P::D:::::D::::D:SHOCKED::D:P!!! :D::D::D:-::SHOCK! :P::D::P:P::D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :O::D::P:::
don? want to buy it, because it'll be gone from your V. C. R in less than an afternoon and you've got the next few months to fill with something better than this 88-minute stonker. Yes that' it?s just 44 minutes of beach action with 38 in the middle of 16-minute ad break (the longest of the year, and that includes the Christmas ad blasts, when it's OK to show ads for things you want to give to people you like). If you like your ads long and slow-mood, then Phat Beach is for you; if your taste runs towards short and punchy, then avoid the film. But if you want your ads long, punch, and slow at the some? time, you're in luck. It'll take you a week of daily viewings to watch the full 360 seconds of ads in Pha Beach, with the added benefit of seeing them in a different light ? and in the dark, too. In other news. Pha Beach' s producer has a new show on Five called The 20-Somethings (W). It is a documentary series that follows a bunch (10?) of young twentysomeethings as they go through their first year of ad-ul?thod in the Big City, London (W). It was the first documentary to be shown on
. He was great on stage when we first got married, and in the movie Grumpiold Man, too, but this was my all time, favorite Walter Matthau Movie, with one of my all, time most favorite actresses, Dina Warman. Dianna is a beautiful and talented lady. I have always loved her and I loved her character, Sarah Pruddon, in this wonderful movie. I love the character, too, and the story of this movie. I love the story about a man, a widower with a child, a girl, a horse, and his best friend. I loved the character of the best horse in the world, too. I remember the first time I saw the movie, in a theatre in Chicago. I had no idea it was a movie until I saw the trailer. It was the best movie ever made. I was so excited to have seen it that I went to the movie store and bought the movie. I saw the trailer and then I bought a copy. I loved the music, the story, and I loved the character and the horse, and I loved the ending of the movie. I was so happy to own the movie and see the movie. I saw that the horse was very, very beautiful and I wanted it to live a long, beautiful and wonderful life and be happy. It is the happier horse and the happier man in the happest horse of all. I loved the movie and
promo that was run on TV then there is no question that Key West wasn’t for you. It is hard at times to tell what the show will look or be like from a promo, that wasn't a issue with this prom and it is a major reason I was interested enough to watch the show. The promo made it looks like some show about a bunch of drunk and partying idiots, I am sure that is a part the show, however if that was all the show was about then I don’t know why I would have watched the first show. As I have said before the promo can make or break your show in a lot cases. In the first show we learned that the show wasn't a bunch about a bunch idiots getting drunk at some party every week. This show is about a group that have a good time, and they know a lot more about Key West than they give them self’s, they just don’t always realize they do know a lot about the island. In the first show you get to learn more of the history and what Key West is more about. One thing that I really liked about this was that it took the time to show you a side the town most people don' know about. I think the most important thing about the first show though was that is was fun. The only bad parts of this first show were a) the show was a half of an episode b) it took the show
us get together and watch something that is a total trainwreck, it'll probably be on this show at SOON!!!!!! This show has been running on WTTA, channel TEN here on the Tampa bay area, for 3 seasons now. It is hosted by the great Joe Bolognass, who is a very talented comedian with a great sense of the ridiculous, which makes for great reviews. He'll show you the good parts, the terrible parts. He's got a good cast, with his two kids "The Cousins" and some other regulars. But, as I said he really is a hysterical comedian. If he ever does anything outside the Tamp bay area I highly recommend his stand up act. This show is a lot of silly, fun stuff, it makes for a great Saturday night at home with the family. I'm not really a great video editor, but the clps are all over You Tube if your interested. Joe is a very talented person, he' s not only very good at standup, he' a great writer and an excellent director of the show (he also directs many others). If your local channel has this or if you get a channel on cable that has this then I recommend it highly. It's the kind if thing I look forward too, and is so well made I can's wait till the next one comes along. If I was a
on his death bed, who’ a former champion boxers. The movie also shows his past relationship and his son’ a fighter too. When the son finds out his condition, his father wants the last fight. He doesn’t expect his son to come to the fight at the end, though, but he comes anyways. It’ also a very emotional movie to watch and a must have to own on the DVD if one has the love or box. The acting is also topnotch. The movie also shows the life of a boxer and what it’ s truly all abou: Fighting. It has a lot of action and the story is great for all ages. It makes you think of a lot of things and the movie shows a lot. It is not a bad movie at all. If the DVD can get in more stores in DVD format I would be very happy. I would give the movie five plus outta five stars. I really enjoyed that movie to a high level when I first saw on cable. I really recommend that movie. If you have a movie, a must have in every home. It has good sound. The story of a good story too. It’ s worth a buy on DVD for the family at this time and at this price and for a boxing fan too. If you don ‘’ t like boxing this is a good choice. I hope that the DVD has the movie in it at the store. I hope that you
of Airline. I don' t know if you've noticed, the movie Air Line does NOT have any black people in it. It is NOT about black flight attendant. The movie has a black director, but the movie doesn& # 39 ;t even feature black actors. It was written by a white guy, directed and produced and starred by a black person.<Br /> <BR />Now, why would a person do something like that, why would they try so hard for a movie that is so completely not what it is? Well, because they are racist, and racist against themselves.<Br /> <BR /> <i >I was really looking forward this movie after the movie "Awesome" was released and it was a huge hit and the next film was called Airline and I thought it had the same director and producer and that it would just as good. Well, it really disappointed. The movie was a complete waste my time. I really don&31, I don& 39 ; t want my money back but I feel like a fool.</i > <Br /><br / >I can understand why it was made in the 18, but I can't understand it, why it& # 39 ;.

and the families who have lost loved-one’ s. However my question to the movie is why did they have the main character as an African-Amerian and he is an officer and there was no African-America officers during World War 1. I would of also thought it was an insult to all of his African-Amerian brothers that he was a higher up in the military. My second comment is why did they make such an important role in history so boring, like who wants to watch people just sit around and talk.  I know that is what happened but it does make for an interesting plot in a movie.  The movie itself was an excellent movie but if I had to change anything it was that it wasn´´t entertaining enough for me to want go to the theater again to see it. I know that I have seen a movie or two that had a plot similar or just as interesting.   I will however recommend this movie as a DVD or for a person who has not seen the film.   I would also recommend that if this movie has not come out in the theater and you do not have a chance to see this movie then you should definitely get this film for the historical aspect and that it is an excellent film to teach and show the realities and truths that war really brings. This movie would be great for a group of soldiers or a soldier that is preparing to go out of the states for war and to see that this is what they
appears, from what I have seen of the trailer, to be a half-heartless director. A film that tries for the wry comedy and the wry drama but falls between stool, a stilt like performance from its leading lady whose best line is, "I'm going shopping". If I were the director I would have had the leading lady in a bacon sandwich in one scene as if there was ever such a thing as an uncomplicated love story. I am sure the book is much better than the film although it could be the script that is the problem. A good script needs to be tight to allow the view, the audience, and the actors the time in which to get into the characters. This is a film in need. There are some good scenes of love and the aftermath but it is the dialogue that doesn't ring right. The best film is in there but you have to try very, very had to reach it and when you do get a hint, it' a bit late. I don´t know what to say. It'll make money for the actors, the producers but will it make a difference in our lives? Not as I see things. Not a film I can recommend, not a film that you will enjoy but a movie you will see, maybe even enjoy if your life is so bad you need to enjoy bad writing and even worse directorship. And that is bad. The end. Sorry. The best of
, pillaged and stole it all from the source material for a quick buck. It's an interesting film with great visuals, and if you have never read the novel you will probably be pleased, if you have read the novels then you will know what a load of bollocks this movie is and should not be watched. In other words this film will appeal to the same crowd that the Twins series did. It's a very poor adaptation with a good cast, which unfortunately only mange one or to very brief shining moment. The rest of it seems to be the film equivalent of a 70' second commercial break. The acting seems rushed and forced. The CG is good, though I have no idea how a film this old managed to use it. But there are very little redeamable moments. If you want to watch this kind of a movie just watch the 100 million dollars worth (and then another billion after marketing costs) Jurassic Park. Or for that mater watch this film without reading Crichton'e book first - then I can guarantee you will have fun with it. I watched it with some of my friends, and they had good time, though I did warn them the source material is superior. So, if this sounds interesting to you, go for the novel first. You will save yourself money, time and some pain. Otherwise, if all you want to see is C. G.'s visual wonderment -
to an average-Joe who is heading home after vacationing with an old college friend and the two get to chattin’. They end up hitting it of and Lisa invites him over to hang out after work.

up, characters developed throughout all six season were used to great, character revealing effect and some of the best writing in television history was used to tell the final story of Frank and Pembleton. As expected, Pembly had a final show down of sorts against his arch rival, and this final case showed some interesting facits about both men and the police force as a general. It also showed Frank’s character once and for all: Frank’s final speech was one of the better written and delivered speaches in film. I have to admit I was a fan of this show right from its first season to last. The show had good writing, good acting, and good direction. It’ll make for some great viewing in syndiication. The final season is a must to own in a collectors library. The first five seasons can either wait for DVD or be purchased cheap. If you’e a big fan, then purchase them in DVD. If you like the idea better than actually viewing the show, then just purchase season 6 and be a big fan. 😉 It won’ts a bad choice either. I hope you enjoy the series. The show gets an 4+ rating from me. Enjoy! – John Hart [easy Reviews] Rating: Overall: [four and a quarter stars out of five] [four and a third stars out five for the series] Cast/Crew [xrr rating=.7/5] [xrr
However, you don&rsquo;&nbsp;t get the impression that the characters have to struggle at the beginning of their careers like in Fast Times, which is a shame. There seems little effort on the characters' part (they don&rsquot make much effort to do anything in the film, in general), but the main character's (Julia Roberts' best friend, who becomes a starlet) success is sudden and unrealistic.<div align='right'> (045) 13:10 (95m.)</div><p align="center">(4.5/16) <a href="http:www.impawardscom.com">Official Site at IMP Awardscom.com, with photos, trailers, etc</p></p> <p></p></td> <p></p> </p> (4.5/17) <p align="center"></td></ul></center> </table> <div style="display: none;"> <div style="display: block; overflow; height 20px; background-image none: url; background: none: none: transparent; background-position 0; background: repeat: repeat: scroll 11.px;"></p><table width="880px" border=5 class="content"> </table> (400) </td><tr><tr
Smith), its wretched superintendent, welcoming the inmates with gusto and a smile on day-of-release, as well as the prison’shistory. The place, in fact is so bad, a prison built to hold those who were too bad even for prison, that even Ethan’s son (a super creepy, and creepy-eyed, William Rainer) wouldn' t go anywhere near the place. But the prison has a secret, and the inmates want to know what’is up with all that. And it is the secret that has brought them together. But when they do find this terrible secret (reveled by a young and adorable, and adorable, Kane Hodge), the inmate’sthings turn really ugly, really fast, and really gory, and the inmates turn on each other in this super-blood soaking, ultra brutal prison flick that will blow the mind with its gore, violence and a finale of such a bloody nature as we have never before, or perhaps ever will again, see, and that is the final scene, which is not to be mentioned here, lest some of you not wish to see one of the most disturbingly gory scenes we’ll likely see this side of the millinum. And it is a scene that is so shocking and over the top,
surprise, he does a great job in other films. In other words this is a good movie in general, but not a great one... And the only thing it has going for itself are the explosisve scenes, that are good, but they were a bit too much. It's a movie you could see in your spare time and then forget about it. I'd recommend this movie only if you're a Dax Shepards fan. You can't go wrong if this movie is free on Netflix. Otherwise, pass. It'd take me a lot of effort to recommend this film. It had the right elements, but the whole thing didn' wanna be done right. It's not bad, but it could' ve and it should've... 3.5/11 stars. I didn t really like this. I didn t like the acting, or anything about it really. I felt like it was just a waste of time. It was boring, and I didn's like it. But it was a good movie. The movie has a lot of heart and is very touching, but it's not the best movie ever, and it' doesn's have the same heart as the other one. It' doesn's really have the same emotional weight. I would recommend seeing this one, but it's not the best one. 7 out of 0. I don t think i'd recommend it to

The narrators are a bit worried for the most part as the man seems very determined to get his life in shape
a high budgeted version of one of my college roommates’ fresh-out- of high-colloidal film classes. You know: the ones where they have you take all these 6 minute short films and turn it down to black &white, and add a bunch of weird shit to it to show how artistic you are? Yea. Except this film doesn’y even have the excuse that it’s a student film, it cost over 120 million dollars to make this garbage and the actors are so bad they make me embarrassed for my profession as an ACTOR! The film is about a 197th Century ship that crushes by its own crew to escape their sordid past. And to top it off they can also walk around on land as humans. It’s like the most generic shit you could put into a sci/fant movie and they still mess up. This was like an 8th century version of Pirates of The Caribbean but without any of Johnny Depp’s magic to make you care about the characters or even have anything interesting going on. The special affects are horrible, the film was directed by a guy who’s been directing for over thirty five fucking years without any success, the main actor is some chick whose only other job is on “the office” and she’s a pretty bad actress even in this. I’ve seen this guy try a million times to make a great film and
tempt us girls with his bare chest. Or the guy with a gut wearing a bathing trunk that exposes the same amount as if it were a swim brief and trying to convince us ladies that he has the perfect package. Oh please! And let’s stop talking to women as if we are not intelligent! And for Pete’s Sake, stop acting so smitten with yourself because we aren't! We are just being polite and are interested in the same thing as you! But we don`t know you well so, we are polite. The only time I will believe that a guy has a big dick will occur if he proves it on his cock pic, if at all! And that goes also, for the women that are so proud of themselves with all the cleaver angles or Photshopping tricks. That makes you no better! So, be honest, and take your pants off to the level of exposure that is necessary for us to have an opinion as if we are in the same room. We would not show up in your living room in a thong and ask you how big your dick is! Just take the clothes off and stop the cheap shots! The only shots taken are the kind that will get your profile banned! It is that easy! It`s not our job as women looking for a real connection with a normal guy to have to do your research and make a judgement call! It`s yours, the guy who is posting his profile
a little more out it than they did. The movie is about a young boy on the autsim scale, and the mother who loves and cares for both him. It is a love story between them as well as the boy’t teacher. It’s a very touching movie, especially for those who have been through the struggle with an autisit child, and the sacrificies made by the family as a whole. But there are lessons for those of us who are not on the scale either as parents, friends, or as teachers of the special ed students with autistic students in our classes. The love and compassion that the mother and teacher both show to the boy are lessons for us all. And there’a also a lesson for the mother to learn: that life is about more than the autistic son she has. The movie does not end on a sad or gloomy note, but rather a note of happiness and joy, showing that there is more than the autisit child in life, even for his parents. I highly recommend this film for all, but especially for teachers of special ed and special education majorees in education. It shows the love of a mother and how her whole being has come out of the struggle and pain of raising a child with special needs and has become a better person for it, and it shows the love that the child’s teachers show for his welfare and how her life is not all consumed in the special ed child. It’sa
and it just got so annoying. The hero is rich. And he likes violence and killing. YAWN. It was so predictably violent – and not even in a good way, just in a way that was boring. I didn’t really know the characters at first, even though we see them interact for a long time. And then, in the end the whole thing was really predictably boring, and there was a bad ending – which I can say without spoilling. If you’re in a bad mood you might like it – but other than that I wouldn’t recommend it. It felt weird to me that I was watching a big movie, with lots of money, and not knowing who or what I was watching. The action felt like a video game. And not even like a great video game. Like a bad one. The acting was bad, even from Channing Tatum. His performance reminded… Read the post → → Continue reading → → → → Post a Comment Comments Off on ‘MagIC MiKe’ Movie Review: ‘Logan’ TraiLeeReViEs’ | Filed by Alicorn under Movie Reviews | TAGS 2077, 234, abrahamic religions are stupid and wrong for being so, Alicia Vikander, andrew lancaster movie review, Andrew Lancaster Movie Reviews 233, andrewlancaster.com, andrewl
themes which this time follows a traveling troupe. This is a very "theaterlike" movie with a cast of unknown and mostly gypsy performer. They live a life of travelling from town-fair to another, they play music, they do acrobalistic performances, they dance, etc, but above all they love. And they love passionately. And the "love" scenes, which happen one after another in every scene, can be very explicit. Not explicit for the sake to show it off, no. Explanation is needed for this film, which has an "episodic nature." It takes its time to tell its story, which is actually a collection a few stories which all come back to the idea (or the theme) in love and sex of course, the main themes here. There are also a few "magically" realistic scenes, which are there to make you think, which are there to make the movie more complex than just a collection of short sex scenes with happy gypsies. But it is still not a "direct cinéma" film. It's not "the real thing". It's just an "artistic" interpretation, but it is very well made in a cinéma vérite way, I must admit it, but there's always this little distance, which is hard to explain, but can be noticed. This film is a little more "real," if you ask. It is
