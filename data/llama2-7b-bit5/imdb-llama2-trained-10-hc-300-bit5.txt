. That, in some ways is part of my admiration for the movie: no effort is made for its to be anything but the story of a female relationship. I am not a big movie goer (but I would like to do more), and even if I was it is doubtless a truism that I would not choose to go see a film like Evenings. Apart from that it is simply not the type of movie I would see in the cinema by myself. Still, my lady friend and I enjoy movies, and she suggested we go see it. It was a very good film to see in the theater. Even if it is not a particularly profitable business arrangement, as she is not one for movies, my company was worth a lot. The main point of my admitting this however is the realization how little it takes to make my wife happy in so far as my movie related deciding go. I have mentioned it a couple o f time in the past, but it is worth mention it one again. My choice of movi es is driven entirely on whether or ot I think they will be well received by my wife or not. I don’t much think about anything in particular: my movi e selection process is one o of pure unadilterated wife pleasur e. And this makes sense, my taste s are pretty boring. In other words: I am a wimp. It is a well
an independent budget is stupefacting. You will find some of the best photographic work this side the big studios in the movie. The story line is good although it could use a bit more development but it is just enough to create a great experience for the vieiwor without any major plot holes. A true classic in the art house scene. There is a reason why it received critical acclaim upon it's release. This is a gem on the independint cinema scene but is still available to all. This is a must see for movie fans. You will not be dissapointed. Great story, great soundtrack, superb acting, great look. It doesn' get any betetr that. Must see. I am a big film buff and this is definetley on my top lists. A masterpieace. I am just amazed at the amount a good film this movie represents. A real must see. Buy it on dv! It's worth it. I would pay 2 dollars to buy it. It' is a great film. I wish I was on their film crew! You will have a great experience watching this. It is definately one you should not miss! An independant classic! I've had this movie in my collection for over 5 years and I am so thrillede that it was done on a budget and still was made to look so good. This is truly an award worthy flick that
isn’t exactly a direct sequel to the first book. This is more like the “what-if” sequels you get to. It’s about the Crack, a drug made from the “cracking of the spiders”. The people that are addicts to the Cracker drug are called Craccers, Crackerites, etc. The premise of “Episodes” books are like movable feats. If you take the idea of that world and create a sequal/what-iffy story, it could make a very interesting book. In my opinion at the end, I felt like this book was nothing without it’s predecess. The first few chapters of the prequel were referenced like 50x. I mean I am soooo sure that I had read this at the beginning. It seemed to be very confusing to the narrative. This book had promise, and maybe it could have been done better if this wasn”t a prequel. So for me, this is just an okay read. I think the people who are really into the story may love this. I was a huge Crackhead, but this book was still sooo meager, and had no conclusion at the “end’ to really say. Like how will the Crackers ever move past the Crack? I know this is supposed to happen in a 3 part series in the future, with the name “E
Italy in post war times a young couple have their lives shattered when the wife is killed by masked burglers at a hotel. 8y ears after their only child is killed in a car race, they move to their country villa. So the stage is set for the masked murderers/burglers to return and murder the parents. This is very good film with the typical Fulcisque lighting and set-ups. There is an eerie feeling of isolaton in a claustrophic country house setting which the film manages to exploite very well. There is a great cast, including an almost 14-stone Ursali Pace in his first performance and an almost unrecognisabkle Carroll Baker from Whatever happened To Baby Jessop in this very good Italian gialli film.

this film. At other times I wonder just what did I get myself in to. I can’t really blend in here. I’m not the type to talk much if anything on fora or the like so don’ know if that will help me here or not. But you know what, as long I have a chance to get something off my heart, mind and soul on this forum then that is what I will be doing. So here is to hoping I find that in these foras. So here I go . . . . . . . for you all . . !!!! (I’m only a little bit nervous . . . I’m ok, I just want out for a bit, so I go on and on. . so here it goes (I think) 1. My life has just gone up and out the window. I don`’ know where or how I lost myself. A bit here and a little there. It’s strange being in the middle of a lot of people, things, and events and yet not being a part of it. I had no reason to leave, that’ll never be an excuse for what I’m going through now (and I’m not the only person that is now dealing with life and my part in it). I am not a part anymore.

superhero films try to be more like the movies, this film went for a different approach. This approach worked for me, and at times, it actually hit the nostalgic sweet spot for me. As a kid who grew in an era where 16 bit consoles were king, I remember the Batman animated series with fond memories and as I kid, it was the best thing to ever happen to Bats. Now, 20 years after this cartoony series aired, this film did more justice to the series than most fans would have thought. It was a great and entertainingly campfire-worth tale that actually has some humor behind its mask. While that mask was made to look like Bruce Wayne'sm, it certainly brought a different kind. With the cast of the show back together as the voice talent, the show's original scriptwriter in executive producer David E.Kelley and Kevin Smith (a huge fan) back as showrunner, the writing actually makes it more interesting. Also a new villain was introduced that was pretty interesting with it being a throwback to the early 40s style gangster movies along the lines with the film "Scarface." Sure it was corny and goopy just about everything but it was still a better effort than you'll ever get from a the live- action films. It is a campfire story, and it's a superheld story.
worth watching. Not only was it a poorly made film, but it was an embarrassment for cinema attendances. But I’m sure it was the only film in the running this year! This was never going to have a challenge from any film. And this was because the last remaining member of the original E.T. crew, Director Stephen Spilbred himself, had died a few months ago and was nowhere to be (see what I did?) found. So the filmmob had no choice, but to get rid of Evan Goldner and his brother. ET was always about two little children getting on the wrong side. But I think the fact there was no director for this one is what cost it. He was always the heart of it. He was the only person who really made the film great (and even Steven was only OK). So no, it shouldn t have won this award, but it did and it s been going. I can tell this will change, but it won t, and I m sure that s because I m not even going to tell them not to do this, but to at least admit it. The biggest problem with the film was, in my opinion that, for a film of the future to be set in the past, it would have to have a lot more of the original E.T. team. So what was the point of the film, other then the fact that it s one of those things
best one; this is definitely not true for Star Trex the original Star Trek reboot. The film is not incoherently bad like the new Battlestone;s Rebellion: this is a film that could never have been released in 1080p without it being immediately obvious. The light souring, which was never very high in the first place, is even worse when it is converted to 1440p. There’s also a lot more glow and haze that just isn? t good enough. It almost looks 7 or so. I will say, though: the film looks the most real when you view it with the 3D version. The film is 3-D and there are some great shadows. This, however, is no reason to watch the film in anything except 3-D, as it is more about the 3D, and also because it?s so incohesive. I understand that some of you will still want it on your set-to-4k collection, but if so then there?s a more than good reason to watch the rest first? or even the whole thing. It?s not just 5, it's 75% as good as it was in IMax. As this is a film, I don?t think I?m too concerned about this, as I?ve already seen the 88.0
". Not exactly the same but the movie had a pretty similar feeling... Like an after-school program special for 8 year-olds. It will get some awards for the special effect for a few days and will disappear quickly from everybody's mind. I was thinking of the movie as of some bad "B" grade production that was made to look good. I think the main problem was not a bad concept but the poor execution of it and very poor writing. I also think the director was a bit too young. I saw it in a theater in Madrid and everyone was pretty quiet, lazully watching the movie, no one reacting to the many inapproniates jumps or the clunky and clumsie dialogues... Just an afterthouht: How did the people that were involved think to actually sell this concept? I am suprised at how little people actually believe in their concept. They think they are going somewhere and they will have an "idea"... When I ask them "Where to?", their response is always: "I don' get your point... Where do you wanna get?" I just don´'t get it, they should be the ones with all the ideas! I mean what is there at stake? Nothing, if they just go with it, that is, the movie, they can make a movie they will be happy about and at the same time not waste their lives and all their effort
waited for years to read the definitve biograghical work about the greatest film director of all- time, Stanley Kubrick. The book also examines the films in an objective way for fans to experience the moviemakers vision in a new way, as it is written from an entirely neutral and objective standpoint. The author has studied Kubrick’s films obsiviously on a personal basis over 10,066 73-plus days, and presents in- depth knowledge on each one, all the way back to Kubrick’ s 3 1960 film debuted. Includes a wealth of photos and neverbefore seen rare Kubrick film material. Each film has its time and its history, and it’ll be time for Kubric’s to come home, after all these years, as TEP. Also includes an 8-page color centerfold section of rare Kubrick movie photos, along with an 69- page biogragphic essasy about the filmmaker. There’ s also a special chapter with the first ever interviews of Kubric’s wife and daughters, and a special section on the last film ever made by the film director himself. So don your thinking man cap, put on a coat and boots, and let’s hit the road on a quest to find the Tales of Kubrick’s Films! (courtest of the publisher). See also

but this is a film from its time. It's a story within a film, with a lot of backstory being told in the first act. It's interesting to watch because we see things through different eyes at different times. It does drag in the middle a lot of the time, but the story is very engaging. You just have to be patient with it. 86% of us liked the movie while 12% of us didn’t. I can see why, and yet I was still able. It’ll be interesting to see what the future holds for this movie now that its in wide distribution. Check it out in your local theaters now. It was great to see the trailers during the film. They gave you the idea of who everyone was, and how it all ties in. You can see a few of those trailer snippents in this movie. That doesn's happen a whole lot. Great job! I hope to watch this for years to. It'll be interesting watching it evolving over different seasons of the year...and I hope it evolves into something really big and really good! I would watch this again. I was surprised just by how much fun the movie is, but also by the amount of emersion to be had throughout it. I have to say that the end kinda disappointed a little bit, but he got to keep his movie, which I think is good. It'
Year’90 films such as The Houskeeper, The Handsome Family and The New Year Paranoias. The script is excellent, the characters are interesting and well-developed and I am sure that most people will like at the very least one character in it, if there’d be a character to be liked. The comedy and the black humor aren’tover the edge, which is not a bad aspect as it provides a contrast to the tension and suspense and this film is not at all what it seems to look. The action and the chase scenes aren’t too bad either. This film was made in 2020 and still it would be pretty relevant if it is screened nowadays, especially in times of the COVID-viruse and the political turmois. I’ve read some comments on the net, that this film would have been better and would probably have been an all time favorite for a certain group of people if a different actor would take over the role of Jude. I can’teven fully agree with it as I don ’the man of the 20th’. But I think that this film still would have been good if Michael Biehn would play Jesse Kain, the father and main character of the film. I can ’recommended this film to all New Year fans out there, so watch it, you won’ the last chance to enjoy it. It will
thought it would be another tear-jers or some sort-of. Not this time! This movie is more action than the actual TV series, and the action is very well done. I was impressed, because many movis today are just action scenes that go for minutes without any kind of plot. Action junkie here, that is one of my biggest pet pices with moviem, so I was happy. The only other problem about this show was the acting of the young people. But in the end it worked, and I got what I paid for. So I would suggest this movie to people who have seen it. My daugter watched it, she liked it too. I bought the movie, I will probably watch again. All in al I can say it was a good film to watch. I bought, for only $4.98 on sale, and I will purchase more of these. For the rest, there is no need for any comments. Just enjoy, it is a good one. I rate it 7 out 6. Keep up the goo work! I am still watching the TV series, it keeps getting better. My family enjoyes the movies too, so we will definetel buy more. Thanks for making such good TV series, we appreciate it. ...more flag 1 likes · Like · see reviews » · preview book · read review » 2 3 4 134 1
filmed. I'm not a huge "Star trek" fan. Never seen a single other "Star Trekk" episode outside the original 1978 episodes. That said, these three episodes of DT were probably some of the most entertaining tv shows I had experienced since The X-Files. The story line was pretty tight and I was completely drawn into each and every episode. The visual effects have aged extremely well and are still pretty impressive to this 2010 date. There was a lot of action and each episode had a great flow. As always, I would have to give it a five. Thanks to Trev and all. I would have loved the idea of having the full movie as a possible season 4 of DL, but I understand that there is only so much of a limited series to go. Great job everyone! 2009-08 - Jason C. from New South wales Australia... 24th episode: "The Star Treet Experience"... the scene in the end where the Borg'd crewmember gets beamed back up to his friends' ship.

movie which made it impossible both for my wife AND I, to believe in it even for one moment! (That’ a big no-no for ANTHONY HOROWIZ – who was, himself, an ACTUAL CAPTAIN in both U-S and German armed services during World War Two!). It was so badly done that it almost made me want to throw away my copy (and I was just going to donte it to a little kid for Xmas! I guess I’ll never find one now!). It’s not a movie – a movie should not be SO BLAND AND BORRING it should almost put one to sleep just from sitting through it. My recommendation: Save your five or six buces or whatever it cost you to see a movie this lopsides and buy the DVD (or any other version) and use it as an ash holder or something! (I guess I could have burn the suckier thing and used as kindle for a fire but, instead I’ll save the suck and stick it in my wife – and she could use it when we go to the South PAr of California next year. (I wish THAT was as excitint as this flick was). Thanks for making such an awful presentation. (The same goes out to the “creator and producer.” – (not to Ms BLACK).) ANTHOR W HOROWITZ
to tears. Even if they are just tears because of the stupidity and idiotic nature behind the whole of the US society in 5793. For me, this movie was a lessen about love. Love in all shapes and sizes, but still love. To feel for each other, to not judge others or be judged. I think this may even be the best movie i have ever watched. I could talk for days about the movie, but in the mean while, i will just quote: "I still have a chance." and "I am your father." and to sum up my review, it is a truly amazing film, one for all ages, everyone should watch it. It is worth it, and i hope it touches every soul. And to sum it up, the last movie i watched that truly reduced me to tears. Good luck Lucas, I will miss you. I just wish you would have made more Star Wars. 10-05-2005. And to end it off with, the ending was simply outstanding. I do not want to spoil it, so i shall leave it at that. But its great. 11/10. I just can not get enough of this Movie. 09 57 03 And it is amazaing how true this movie is, at least to me. It showed me what true happiness really is. True love. It is
are all the same, with Odysseysus being the WW2 vetter who've been traumatically separated from his wife, and Penny taking his place as the wife and mother on the homefront. The problems are also as expected, though the filmmakers do a good jib in balancing both stories and making the home front storyline a little bit smarter. That said there are some stinkers still, including the dreadful dialogue in the home-side scenes. Not as bad as that of the original, but still a big disappointment that these scenes lacked the sharp edge and intelligence for a piece that otherwise tries to deliver a good story. There's some interesting characters like the one played by Bing and I think the cast was pretty good, and overall it'll probably be a solid entertainment piece for most people - but for the critics it's pretty obvious that not everybody will be able to appreciate the filmmakings' effort either, because it'll never be possible for every movie to be a great one for every man - or even just most men. For me myself I could see that this was an entertaining one for the most, even with the flawed dialogues which otherwise would have left me bored and/or annoying. I'm pretty sure that this movie would be best appreciated on the DVD by the fans rather then on the big screens though - and for them its a fair
normal average white woman. I thought the only white woman that looked kinda remotly black was the one in GI Joe but this Italian chics is real and soooooo damn hot she got the real black body and ass I mean holy shit I couldnt believe my eye when I see her I was shocked how much she resembled a nubian African women that we know in the black race. So I have a serious question that needs answering to all you brothers out ther who have been to the movie theater how many black women in thier I was shock me I saw no black females period. I mean really there are no sister in the movies I dont know if they just dont show them or what the filmakers are trying so desperately to get me excited about is a Italian black chics but thats not black I mean black is black shit come on man I mean this is just a stupid movie if all the black females are in jail or in a mental instituion or something then whats left for us as guys to see. I mean this is a huge disapoin to me as a man and as a black film fan this has to stop Im telling I cant sit in these theaters no more cause I feel alot like a nubian a white man with a black heart. DAM I mean this is like an epic fail movie maker wake up what the hell your movin has

see the movie on the cinema but now I dont think I will waste my money on something that didnt even follow the story. I had so much expectation for a movie that had great actors and crew behind it. The beginning is good and then they just go off the book. The actors in my opinion were amazingly casted but they wasted their talents in poor scriptwriting. So sad to see that they didnt even follow the original story. The ending in particular was just ridicilous. I would have gave 2 thumbs down but I only do that to movies that are really terrible. This is not a bad film but they just did a poor work. I also did not like the fact they mixed up history with the story. Did I mention that I was looking for the book on the cinema? Oh well, I still like the movie and I still think it was worth watching. It would be great for a teen audience and I think they will like it. If someone has not read Harry Porter but they are fans, you do not have to read the first books before you watch the movie. The story will follow and you can not miss any details. For fans of the book I would not recommended it since you know more things that are going on. The book is better. There are so much more I would love the say but to not to spoil it for those I recommend them, but I guess its not going anywhere since I think this movie

goes on vacation to the beach with his wife, and Joe just can't believe his luck at all! When he woke up in the morning there was a gorgeous, tall, voluptious blonde in his room with a seashell bra! Joe couldn't help but staring at this blonde, who was his wife's friend and it drove him mad! All this time Joe was dreaming about the blonds voluptous body, he didn’t know it was going up and down the beach with a bunch of other people. He thought to him self "I must go find a nice quiet, secluded place on this beach I'v never seen before, this is my dream place, and I need to find some way of making a woman my own" So Joe rented 2 chairs and put them by the water by a huge palm, he was having the times of his life when this voluminious blonds friend came and sat down next to him. That blond must have thought Joe a strange person but Joe wasn't going to be denied. Now this blonds friend, she was the sweet type, and she would always help the weak, so she asked Joe if he'd like a drink. What does Joe say… he'll take whatever she's got! So, the drinks come and the blond is drinks some and then leaves. So now Joe is getting drunk
actors' fee; they must have taken it as they had no other choice to find something else. I don's see anything good in this production either. I am so disappointed that this is a Korean drama I expected more than this. If they don’t know how, get someone who knows how. I can't even believe this is from a Korean drama. It'd better be their last work. Anyway what I saw is not the best of what Korean dramas should be. I think they should be responsible about whatever they are producing, or they should be the last. Very, very sorry for the actors! Just don't watch! They are not worth it!!! They made a fool of us viewers. Not to forget the director, writer and even those who agreed to work here. Shame, total disappointment, and this is not even the best of the Korean dramasssss!!!! Please... I can hardly believe it... They shouldn’' even let this drama on the screen! It is so poor, and the director didn'tdirect even the first scene! I’m surprised why they let these actors star in a production with such terrible script, bad editing and acting. It is just terrible and should be given to those who have not done anything else. I’m even more disappointment in this drama. Why don’t they let another writer write it? I just couldn’t watch the whole thing. I hope that
say it's good. The film is simply bizarre and very interesting in many of it's concepts. Apart form that, and many of the special effect sequences being well done, the script is terrible. But it' s worth watching for it.s bizzare qualities. I recommend it. It has the feel of a film made as an art film, but the script and characters make it very hard to enjoy. Still interesting.

film. It'd be a really easy movie for a guy like John to identify himself in. And for us guys, it really feels good when our heroine falls in the same direction for love with us. Even if that'd be an unrealistic concept, it still feels good. I never got the 'I can' believe in love from John Candy, but it's there. The love story here is sweet and beliveably innoccent. It makes the "i am so in trouble if we are caught" plotline, that runs through this film. The whole thing seems like a big party that just happens in some old house. Some old movies feel a bit too staged. This one manes just seem to fall in place. I think it does that becuase John Cander really seems to be just that "regular guy with an amazing sense of humor" who seems like he could just be in the same shoes in a house a block down the road like any of you are right now in your home watching this. The plot doesn" have a whole lot of depth, but I think it's really well put together. The story really never gets boring and it'll feel like it'll be all set up for a let down. But there are not, and as the title says we end this story feeling a little "high on believing" that it feels right. It's not some master
horrible, the effects are cheap and unconcieveable and the story makes no sense. I recommend to only buy this movie if your into getting drunk and laugh in the worst way at it. But if you're serious about watching a good movie, then forget about the dammed Vault! It's an atrociry to filmmaking! ...I think 2/10 is about enough to rate it right now... And i hope this piece will soon be forgotten in the annals(lol, just a joke) .....and if there are any fans of this movie, do me one favour and keep a distance. That'd be great... ...Oh, and for those die hard horrorfreek fans out there. I want to warn you. If it'a horror i like it, it doesn`t necessarily mean it`s good! That`s what i say! ...Oh god, that`d be a great excuse to start criticizing my other likes! I hate it when pple say that to criticizing. I like the movie you like, you hate it.. it` s personal opinion! (and i'll defend it to an eternal death) ...Now, back with the reviewing... ....Hm. Where was i? Oh yes! ...I'm off to the movienight and the popcorn is on! "See ya later guys!" ... ... ...Dead

sense of humor has the morbid humor and darkly comical senses that it does. There are many problems with the movie, and I'm sure you've all heard them before. Too many characters that are never really explores and are treated the way they were, just to make up the numbers for the movie. The movie doesn'tknow what its trying do and what it should stray away from. And the ending, was utterly ridiculously and absoulutley terrible! I was so shock at what a complete and utterly mess the movie was that I almost fell out the chair!!! This movie is not for kiddy's, and neither should it be!!!  <b>Pro-Con</b></p><ul><li>Its darkly comical humor is what brings the horror aspect of this film to life!!!</li>.<b/><ul><b/><li><b>Cons</l></ul><li></ul><ul style="padding-top: 0pt; padding:0cm 6pt 0pt 6px; padding left: 0cm; border-left-width: .1pt"></p></li></ul> </li></p>" /> // ]]> // ]> </script></div></div></div> <!--/--> <!--/comments--> This comment has been reported.

film after the film' s credible first act, after only 44 minutes or 42 minutes, depending which version you watch. I know that they say that the first act of the movie, which ends in the first 15 minutes to 34 is credible, but when watching it in it was not as good as it could, and should of be. The fact that in the first act it does not even try to be over dramatic at the time that is the first major issue that this film. The first act does not feel much like the first act of a horror movie, but then again I think one would say the first act of a film is the one that sets up the rest and so maybe you could say the filmmakers are thinking about it all wrong. But the problem is that the second part is just as unbelieving to the vieewers, who are in the mood for a horror movie and who are expecting a good scares. This film is too scareless, and for someone like me, who likest to be scare when they watch a movie, I found this film to take place in the wrong part of the film to be in the middlem, or the last part of a film. And that means the ending of this film to be a bit slow to start and with some issues I do find the ending to the film, to not be that great. But in saying that to the next
any sense, and the only purpose it seems it was originally produced is to bring into light the problem of Aids, especially in the third-world countries, where the disease does have serious implication because of the lacking of proper infrastructure to battle it with. The movie is not a success as a romantical comedy, or an entertainive piece, and it is definitely an amateur production - it seems as some of these actors/actresses are from stage theatrics, and are just beginning to be introduced into the movie art. However, the movie has a deep message in it, and it is quite brave to show some of its scenes. For instance: when the main charater (play of a young man) is "practically raped" and "taken" in the middle night by three guys who had just left the bar... I think it is quite difficult to make a bold statement in a movie like that, even if it is a little out of place... well, at least I liked the point they wanted it, it seems like a strong moral issue, but the presentation is not really good. Also, I believe that the movie could have been done better had it been produced by another director. I have never seen any of the actors before, and they seem that the have been chosen because the have had some experience or training and this is why this could not work, because they did not seem right for any particular charaters. I will
an action film. The second half is actually good for a while. But then it gets back into the whole sex-comedy crap that has nothing whatsoover do with the film’s plot or even the characters, but it was there just to please the teenie weenies, who think that there will be a naked girl in every movie, even when the rest of us are watching it to see whether there will be some action! That’s when I started to get a head-ache just like in “Snakes on a Plana.” I don't want any of those, thanks. I would rather have some interesting plot, action or characters to watch. This was just disappointed... and boring. The only thing that I can recommend you to do after seeing this film, is that you get yourself a cup of hot black tea to get rid that head-ache. I did exactly that, but it didn'a cure me. It just made me even mad. "The Hangover" did everything better and it was a comedy. And I want to see a sequel. Just imagine how great the next one would could be. With the same plot, but with a more interesting character- and story- development. That's what I was expecting from "Superhero Movie," but I was wrong... very wrong... "Never again." The only exception was "Fatties vs Thinners II"
also aims to mock the original, and not to imitating it. It is not a complete story-movie so it makes use only of short parts from it. I did not like the original, nor this parady. I had to watch them both, so for those who need to see them both, I am suggesting you not read it and see it yourself. As a parady, this is very bad, you can imagine all the jokes and all. It is not that fun, and it is not meant to make fun of anything. It has no purpose at all that I could find. So no spoiler. If anything happened in the original, then those things also happened in this parody but I am still not telling you, if you don'ts want the spoilers read it yourself! I can not even tell you what they parodyed, the original. It does contain some sexuality, and it is intended for a mature audience, you will find some naughty things you never want to know about... well, I don not want spoilers either! So, if anything atrocious or at least unfamiliar happened in the original... You don't have the slightest hint here! As for the language, there are some exclamations that are common in moviebut are not appropriate. There were only two such that I noticed, so this is quite okay by my estimation, but I am a good judge of such
- whom I knew from Cluelss and Wet hot American summer, but also because of the name of Michael Peňík. I didn't pay much attention to the movie title and the plot then, so the review is not based completely on a view from 2003 perspective. When I saw it again, I didn’t have any specific expectations. I just wanted to know whether this "Buffalo way" works or does just not work. So what does buffalo way mean? It is a way to be on the “winning side” and get whatever is the most valuable thing when people on a “losing side” are not going to get much. To put it more simply, the Buffulo way means to lie, backstab, cheater, manipulate, screw and do everything bad you would not do personally to get ahead. Is this the way of life? Well it depends on how high you are (in the hierarchy). You might be willing to kill (literal or figuratively) someone else to get ahead. But there is not much you can and should not kill (e.x., do not steal or cheat). I really don´t have any problem with movies where “people are people” and where they can do and behave nasty. But I do have a problem if it isn´t justified or explained (either in a movie or in real life), and it just stays
) with her "1O1O Dress' that caused quite the stir in 1974, so I was keen to see her 1960s inspired swashbuackling feature in 1O and with a title like 'Mambo Italian,' it sounding like she was set for stardome once and again...but this was far closer, if not better received back in the days when the press were just a little more reserved...here in the U.P, the critics hated her...so why bother reviewing it in the 'Sunset Boulevards' review section?! In this case you get to read some of my favourine comments as a film critic on Bo's acting and performance, a must have for anyone reading my 'Fantastic Films' site's film criticism section. So in this 'Bo Derek in 3D' page and in 'Bo's Own 21 Questions,' there is a lot of Derekeana. I don’'t know any reviews for Mambo Italo which are more scathing. It seems no reviewer has ever given a more brutal critical slant on a movie. In my section, I also explain the reason why this film is a must have as a 2-D DVD for those collecting moviies on Bo, it's my opinion and I stand with it. So I guess

... it is pretty obvious if YOU know the characters. But, it makes a good intro to the Marvel Univesre for anyone who doesn'thasen's comic books, and I think it stands alone pretty OK. I don'thasen the other one, but will go watch that in the next couple days as this one was really enjoyabl. 4.5/8.... not an amazing Marvel film but not a bad one either and certainly better, as usual than the 1960s version, though the first Avenged film was one or two grades higher. I didn't like the end battle scene or some of the characters, but if this had cameo'd more than 1 or maybe two characters from other Marvel flick it could have gotten a perfect score from 10. I would recommend either one of the three Avengers films to anyone. This was pretty good! It was pretty light on humor at least, maybe less in tone and pace and just more action and story, which could be a good thing or bad, but I was really enjoything the comic scenes. It's good for Marvel, too. They've had three solid stand alone movies now, I'd give the first Thor the same grade and the second movie was also really good, maybe just a bit better than the third Captain America or Avenger moviet. I will watch them all again, I
at children, but the themtatic is far to maturing for children to understand. This is a film about sexual abstinsence for children with a hint that they have sexual desire, yet that it is not the way to go. However, the film was a big success in Germany and even in the USA, so obviously it works for the adult audience too. As such this is a pretty good way to introduce adult children to the problem. But I think the film should be classed as a porno anyway. Not because it shows more then a hand. But it shows a lot more then a hint. It is a movie about children and sexual abstince which is something you can do on TV in prime time. But not on TV in prime children time if you want to keep your license as I see. I wonder when the people who wrote this had children. As far I can tell the film is made by them, as most good porno is. Still, the way it is done was an amazement for me. As it also was the way it is introduced to the audience. It was shown at the end and it really was a good punch in the face. I do have something against the way the pornotopic was made. As I feel it should not be put in the same category. I have seen a few films that use the same trick, but in a far worse matter. It seems it is the easiest thing to do. Make
CGI in this movie to do all the work for him. He'll look at it and nod, then say "yes, but I don'y have to do anything do I? Right, right?" You'll also be delighted to hear that he thinks his character is so much more clever and heroically self involved than the other characters, which includes J. Edger Holder. So, you know, he knows a little about that, and hey, he'd like you all to know he's a big George Carrere and the Mighty Punisher fan. He'd especially love it all that he'll always be known as Mr Indiana Jones, since it gives people pause. Then Dutch starts asking questions and trying, by the end, to do as little as humanely possible, including walking out of a scene with a shotgun. I'm not making this up. Harrison Ford knows that a movie about a serial kiiiiiiiiiiiller will be about as enjoyable as being stuck behind an F 150 with "Hair Band", "Big Balls" and a Confederate Flag on it. He will not have any problems with people not likingly this particular fimm. But he wants you know, if you'e reading this, because he's got a lot of "fans". This movie'll probably be good, because it's got some good lines in it,
reasons for things. The movie is almost like it has taken a couple of key things from the beginning (The Frat Party) but everything is just vague. It doesn' care about the story and just seems like a boring comedy rom-com at times. All it needs to do is take the best parts from the story then add them to the movie. For example, the original story had a scene that had a character who was bullying others in front the house where all the characters lived then the next scene came about 20 or so pages later and they have a new guy come and live next in the same building and he is all sweetness and lightness, he is a new neighbour who is great then the original bullying guyy sees it is the new neighbour and starts to hate him because he was a sweet duke. This is just a scene to show the bully in the books but it also changes the bullying because he bulies him more in the movies, then he meets his girl and says she is going to come and see. It does not mention the girls character and they are not in love, this girl who is bullied is just a background girl and the bullying is changed slightly in the movie. In the movie they just say he is a good guyn but he was not supposed to be good from early ages, he started the abusin in the house and they were all too afraid of her to stand up to him
hero, Frank Sinatra playing the President of France, is a man who would do anything, including kill in order not only to save his country’s honor, but his own life too! A good cast and solid cinematography don’tai??ai??i?t save it from being a pretty weak thriller with a lousy script. The film was so dismally unsuccessfull at the box office it was considered to be the last straw for both the leading man and the studio that made it. The film was later remade as a TV movie and as a made for TV mini series as well that did much better in the viewing audience but unfortunately, not in the viewing figures. A good movie that was badly bumped around along its torturoused path to the silver screen! See it and judge it according to the time it is set in!

things that a fan can relate to, which means a huge amount! But even if you can' t relate to Tolkien, as in you haven' t read any of the books I can promise you the same level of fun that I had reading my first fantasies growing older! As for the story, well that's the fun part, you really can choose what to read for it contains a bunch of short tales that are set to be part off the original work of Tolkien, and even if they' re just part or one of them it is still a great read! The characters are lovely and their world is so vibrant and alive! And finally, as a Tolkiens reader I have nothing to add to why this author is so great, you've just to give him a read to see it your self! And I have an extra tip, read it in the night and you have to share the joy of reading it on a full night!

it'd already been done to death. So what could they have done? Well, a little imagination would'a been helpful - a whole heap of imagination, in fact. They even missed the boat on a few simple continuities. Take, as examples, the first remake, the first time I saw it. A man runs into one of the two main characters to get to a phone. He slipped by, but you can still hear him yelping. This is, apparently, in the original script; yet in the film, no sound is emitted by him during the scene (and he isn’ t there in another one), though this is not something they could help. Also (and this, for once, may be down, again to the script): a major mistake that could'a been easily fixed if they'da spent that whole budget on more than a 2-minute sequence that looks like it was filched, unimplementable from a TV movie. And then there' the ending. That's not the ending of the book, which, I'm reliably informed, is the best part of it (it's not all that good, though, as most of its reputation comes down from the '77 miniseries). And it' a real cop-out to cut everything else. All that'a left are the final few words, and it leaves the door very slightly open for them, should'a
this should have been better. To be fair it has some good points; it's well made and the cast in particular are very watch-worth and you may enjoy it. It has the right look and feel in some ways. But it is all just too bland and la-la, I did not care about the characters, their motions and actions had some holes and it lack that tension that should be present in a film like this. The ending was weak also, the film lacks the bang it needs to finish, in fact it should really have started on the run and should be more of a character-building film to set it up. It's a missed-in opportunity really, the film is not poor, but it could have so easily have been so good; I wanted so badly to like it but I just felt it had no point or focus. It's good actors in the end do little here, although all have their moments. This is a film that should have been so enjoy-worthy but ultimately falls short. The whole thing just feels like you are there for the story not involved with it. Wanna see it? Sure, but don' be expecting to be blowned out of your seats. I am going to give this a final rating of.....7/15*. I rate this film a poor 7 outta 15*. It could have, and it should have. It'll never be the heists
told in a very odd way. There was no way to relate with any one of the characters, they weren't developed that much and the story was told from a viewpoint which left a lot left to the viewers imagination. The visuals werent as excactly spectulular, but the scenery is a big highlight. The story is about "The Chernobly disaster". I've never witnessd a film about this catastrof and it left me wanting for the truth to be portayed in the film rather than a lot of speculation. The film isnt a bad film really. It's just a 7 if you ask me. This is no Masterpieces or even good films. But it's got a lot to say in a strange and disturbing ways. I'd rather watch a good, true and excactly dramtised film of this catrostrofe that's more true and accurate to reality and not so artistic and speculating at the same time. I would say this might be for people with a lot of patience and who want to learn more on this catastrofi. This is for anyone in that category. If you're the type who want'd to learn more on this catastrofi and dont really care for accuracy and details on what happened to people on Chernoble then you'll love this film, otherwise it's a mear 6.5
and main actors of this film are not even close to be that good at doing a horror movie. A lot of the camera angles were a waste or they were poorly selected to see the person who is about to attack the next person in line. The first 3 characters in line for a movie are just there to get there ass beat. Not sure if some of these guys in line did something to piss off someone or if they are not that talented of actors, but it seems as if that is who they are hired to play for the movie. The first to bite it is the girl, this is where it gets real. Next are the 2 guys that were already in line, and the woman who was sitting in the front of this whole row. They got beat up and then they got killed, while I was waiting for the girl to get killed I could not help myself and said to the guys next to me "oh please don' t let her get away. What do I care if it will be like 10 minutes of boring footage after she gets killed". So a guy in front me and I are talking about how it is going to be really f*ked and how the guy gets attacked because he is in the middle of the row and is the next one to get bit.

The pandemic is so deadly we have to put on our N95 masks to protect ourselves.

The film, directed by Steven Soderberg, takes place in an underground railway that seems like an Eagle' 1 train.

A nurse, played Jean DuJardin is vaccine passports and protect his wife from the virus. There is a murder mystery to solve.

(4) I'd give 7.5/7 as a rating. (hide) … (1) A good film. Not great, not perfect, but good enough to watch. I loved all of its cast and characters. I don'td
better treatment than what Hollywood put out back on April 12. And for that reason alone, “Stoogeology” should have been a hit, but it wasn´s. Instead, the DVD went out of print. It hasn´’nt been recalled, though. You may be able t find it if your luck and determination hold up to the challenge. If you don´t, you can order it on Amazon and get it shipped from the US, or buy from any online reteller. Of course you can get it in a DVD store, too. But they are getting ridden off their asses nowadays, for the same reason as any independent store: WalMart, et alia, have taken away the sales to the small fry. They can´t compenate on price, so it has to be the quality. WalMarts are souring over people who demand quality, they´re going to have people who only care for cheap cackle. Thus, Stoogeology was not a hit. It´ll stay hidden from the masses, but it´s certainly worth it for any Stoogy lovers. It takes us back in history, shows a lot of rare (and not-so-) footage from the early days of the team, and introducing the characters: their genders, their faces and their personalites; and shows how The Stoogs´ characters became what they were. Even if they
comments on animals I was able to find, in case it might be helpful for other readers. I've listed them in the order they appeared. [If you find I missed anything obvious, please let know, and I'd add them in.] I hope to add any animals in future eds. (See also the other 'Phoenix and the Dragon'.) This particular list is by the editors, and I have also made this note on the text pages. This is just in case it might be helpful to other editers, etc.: As with a zoological key, some of the animals included here are only distal relatives of the ones they represent, but the editers did try and get the more closely related species, if possible, and it makes a good start. If anyone does find other animals that fit their definitions and that could have been used here instead, I'll add notes on them in this entry. It'll help when one of us is working with a list of animals, and is searching all entries for the words 'animal' or 'being' or whatever. -- Sara Stinson (talk to me, please! ) 06 Feb ÃÂ¢â?¬â¹ÃÂ¢?¢ 0n 7 Mar: See a related page with entries for animals by editors in the next book. I'll be adding more animals here, when and IF I'
the moment, and found it viscerally stimulated my sympathetic nervose. Upon reexaminations, I was pleased at how the visuals and the sounds of SEA of DUST had left images and sounds to stick in my head. It didn't matter that there were some gaps or loose ends in how the story was told. Like in other films by BONNIE BAGBA (Born in 74 and raised in Liberlia) like her film FEATURE WRECK, I was able to look past these flawed moments and really immeresed my self in SEAMERCILE OF PUHDD. I love that the sound of SEAMIRCILE DUSU is composed by RICHARD REZNICK (South of Nowheres, Mood Swings, The Intruder) and not to undermine the sound score, but the film works best when is is just all about sound effects and voices. Like the previous films of BagbA, it'll work on a low resolution tv if you are really strapped. But for my money, I'd want to buy the official release from the filmmomaker, bagbA (or her friend) to make the experience better, but SEAMERCEIL DUSU still has an a lot going for it. I'm going tp order my copy of film from bag
in English with English and French subtites, the movie presents us a different type of story. We can see the story of a young telegraph operator whose name is Ondine from this film. She is a very beautiful and a pure lady who lives in Ireland, in the coast. Everyday she is fishining the sea, the sea which is her only friend. She is a lonery lady because she is only living with herself. She is a beautiful lady with pure heart and mind. One day she finds a dead body in sea. The body is from one fish. The head is cut from fish. And Oondine thinks it is her friend, her sea. From one hour Oonidie starts to talk with dead man. And she thinks he is the most beautiful person she has ever seen. He tells her that, actually she is dreams but she is not awake and she is still aslpeing, and sleep will be over when she sees the beautiful face of the man. When his dreams will be over, she wont see her dead father anymore. At the end Oondinede sees the face of the death, the beautiful face. After death Oonodinede goes to the hospital and when she comes awake she doesnt remember the dead man. But everytime she is asleep she remember him and the beautiful dream she had. This movie is an awarded movie from CANNAS, CANNES FILM
, I feel like an unguent is spread across this part of my body which hurst, so that it does. The only reason for not doing so is that if the person doing it is doing it with your knowledge and permission it is not assault, even if he has other nefarios intentions. The other thing I like about this song, it has a chorus, which is a simple repetitive rythym like ‘na na na’, but it is also really beautiful. This song is one that will remain with us. When we are listening to it we may not be paying any attention to the words at all, and yet they stay. The chorus of ‘na, my life’ will stay in the memory, the chords of the versicle will stay and haunte us. A beautiful song. This is a song I wish I could give back to our son, but in his youth he had not been interested, and I am too late and they have taken the CD to his grave in the Pacific Ocean . . so . . he will just have to stay with this song for ever, and I, for the moment, for the rest o life, in which I hope to live, it is just as well. A good song for a father/ son relationship, like I, in my old age, was to the old ones, it has a sense it is part of the cycle, and that the generation passes on. We all do
his policies and calling them a criminal. The effect of the 120 minute speech on the audience is not known but it has been described in one way or another as "Stalinism is dead". The speech had wide support in Russia and was widely reported and in the west. There are no record or films at this stage but there was considerable reporting in the western press. For example The Times 3rd march 56 reported that "a tremor is reported in the Kremlim after Mr Krushev described the former leaders of the Soviet state as having created ïs a system inimistic to human nature'." In the same week the Evening Post of the 6 march 1976 reported that the "speech was met in the west by a great sense as well of relief as it would have been on the streets of Warsaw or in the trenches or the battlefields of WWII." The speech was widely reported in Germany as well as the west, but there is no direct evidence of the effect of it other then the fact they it caused a crisis of confidence in the West in its image of the Soviet system and the Sovieta'e leadership and policy. What is not known is how much and how long it took for this to filter down to the masses. However, we can argue that this change in the policy of the Soviet union, and the change of its image in Western eyes could have led indirectly
in the states and the first three seasons were especially hard for any fans to get. I always wondered why it had never made it to DVD in the states. Whenever the subject of Baddiel and Skinner came up it would be hard to not at some time bring up Bottom. The two created the show and it was always a favorite, along time favorite as they started making their own shows. It is a show that is almost a throw back in its own style and is still funny and even wacky 20 plus year later. The show would be created and filmed in the UK but would always be the most unique and interesting looking show I had ever seen and still today. I could look at the sets and how the two stars would set up shots and the use of props and sets. The two always had a knack for creating what a set should look and feel. They knew what angles and how the set should be lit and what was needed to make the show look real. I always wondered why they never used music in shows like this and when they did it always stood out. They always would use songs that fit the scene, and what happened in that moment. It was always so good as the music always fit what happened on screen. The show always had a very interesting and creatively unique feel, with the shows always being a little odd in their nature. The show was always a little twist on many shows in the ways
this filmmaker’d work — the visually stunning work. This movie has the feel of David Lynchs’ work but for this movie, I feel it fits perfectly. It was directed by a director (Wong Kit; it’s his director’s debut) that I had never heard about before, but I can’ll definitely see more of his work. This movie is a beautiful piece that is well worth watching. This movie is a masterful story about the beauty of the city of Rome. This movie is a master piece, just like Rome! Watch this movie and tell me what I am wrong about. It is a masterful story with a unique look at the city. I recommend it. Also recommend checking it out if you enjoy movies about Rome. This movie deserved a better rating than it has. This was a great movie. I liked most every scene in this moviw, from the beginning to the ending and everything in-be-tw-tween! Go see this! This movie deservers a big thumbs-down. I am surprised this movie has such a low rating. I hope they keep making movies like these. They are so worth it. One of the best movies I ever did see! I hope everyone else will too, this movie is a master piece. It is a good movie, it is a story of a boy who wants to make a movie, he thinks the whole world will love it. He tries
main character, Gustav von Albermein, is gay, this is not the case in the film. In the final analysis, the two works are united by a philosophical question: "What is the importance, the meaning of life?" Throughout "A Death is V en ece," Albe r mein wrestles not with his love of women but with his need for beauty. He tries to define it, to make sense out of the world he has created for himself and the people around him; he struggles to reach the unattainable, to see what lies beyond what is visible. The film begins with images which seem to be just that, fragments of Alberemeins life; the film is a monta ge of scenes shot in Veni e. Albeermein appears in a series that range in tim ing from the 1700s to 59. Albeer meins struggle seems to parallel that of his protagonists of the films, "Deep B reath," who appears here as Adele Jansen, a te l egrapher for Albe r men. As Albe er mein, von Stroke, writes, he seeks truth. And his journey leads now h are, to Venice, with his son, who appears to represent his egotist ica . It could be said that Al be rmein is seeking death in this film; for the
but I get around to it every couple. (My mom likes it, and she always wants me to be with her for family things, and this is the only way for us to both enjoy something on "TV". So I watch, and then we talk/drink/etc.) As the title says, this is one for the books. If you're a person that loves Christmas in general I would not recommend. If it're not my kinda people, you can'e handle this at all if you don' t like it already. (You get all up in arms for everything.) But if your people do, then we have a merry Christmas time ahead of us and all that jazz (you know, whatever this movie isn�t). But anyway, on this list of the top twelve Christmassy mov...

I have actually seen. I can' understand, however, how someone would buy into the whole thing. But maybe some of y'all can help fill in the gapes for my non-existent brain cell(s). I'm a little confused on how the first time around, this film was a comedy, then the second time it was "The New Face of P**n." My buddy and myself were pretty sure there were two separate films. But I looked at the trailer to "The New Face of P*rno," and I guess there really is just 1 flic... But does anyone know a little more background on this? Was one of the original characters a stripper or something? Also, I don't know if this is spoiler-related so much as it is... I just don't understand. It'd sure be interesting to know more history behind it. So, anybody? Thankee. =-) (And if the trailers link doesn'y' get you, there' no point in watching it; there's an uncouth word, and a nail-through the hand that makes the movie completely inaccessible... So I don' know if it's still there...) (oh, and I think the film is called "...Beard Door," rather then the "Beh*d Room".) (And I think that was a jokey-pun... hehe.)
made.... and that is its greatest foul (excluding all the foul language. See below for all the foul stuff). This movie is an example of what one person, who has had his soul crushed, can do with their own life. And it is not a movie that has a "cheesiest ending ever" like the critics love to label the best movie with a happy ending like "The Sound of Music." (For example; The Sound and the Foul.) This movie is the classic "Rock-nola". I have never before been able, in the course oF my entire life, to see such amazingly beautiful people come out of such a bad part, and this movie is that story, and it' s very uch like the life I once knew, and I am glad. You are gonnna love this film, and I recommend you see it. My rating: 2 out 5 stars. (out o five stars). PLEASE NOTE THIS MOVE IS A PUERILE AND PERVERSE, TOTAL PERVERTS, HIGHER-THAT'S ALL. Please note this is a PERVERSE AND PURELY-HARM-AND/OR I DREW THIS FROM THE WARM HAND DIDI OF MY PRESIDENT. Please note that it has been brought to my atention that I have been felling
didn’t fully appreciate the artwork. At that point I liked stuff like Scooby Do. As I got a little bigger though, I still liked “kids” and “teen” movies. In high school, I loved The Princess bakes too. I also was a huge Harry Potty and Lord Rings fan... all because I wanted the storyline in my own life... I wanted to live in that dream world. (Even though I was an oddball tech nerd in school!) In hindsigh, I think the movie is an accurate assessmetn on what it means tp live as a princess with a kingdom... and all the struggles that come along wit it.... (BTW, Princess Bakes to was very good and a true story... so I recommenend it). So I still have an interest for this subject even now when my klds are 22&5. I’m a very nostalgc person, and when I think of princess movies I do reminice of all the time when I was a kid and teen. (Although, that time in my life now seems like a long time ago! That’ so amazing!!!!) But that’s how the stories come to me... through my nostalgic memory. (And this is true for all the stories in this book.) There’sa special place in my heart still (even now with grown
I heard that I was very happy because I always loved these actress.I thought the whole movie was pretty much about mother - her and her daughter, so it was basically a family drama and a lot of comedy too, which I also liked.There are several fun fun scenes and also some sad scenes, like when Adele' s dating a man, that he is not that good for them.But they all end in good way.This movie is definitely worth seeing.I highly recommend it.I just wish the moviw was longer cause 109 minuets just flee by quickly.So if they released a two hours version I would definitely watch it.But all in all it's still a good movie....MOVIE OF WINNERS is about a family who lives their life like any normal family, but there is one twisted part to their lives which is their son is autism and he is on the extreme side and he has a very odd sense of humor and when he gets mad or sad he throws tantrum fits......This movie is a bit depressing at times because you see how much they have to deal with when it comes tio raising the kider and how they all do everything they possibly can to help their son out but it just keeps getting worse because they are not sure what to make of it or how to deal with this.Anyways the movie is pretty good with a great ending too...I recommend it
ten but the fact that people may not understand because of it being in German. I love this film because the actors in the movie are really hilarious because they are always making fun of the characters in this funny movie. The movie takes a long time to start and when the movie does start it is really good if you like comedy. This movie is really funny because the actors are always making jokes towards their fellow teachers. I love to laugh and so I give it a 9 out of 9. I think most viewing people will have trouble understanding the movie but if they pay close attention they will laugh. I suggest that you do not miss these actors in a bad teacher because they will make your view an enjoyable one. The actors are really funny because they are always making fun and not to mention the fact that they are not making this movie because of the film maker just because they want a job. They are doing this because they love comedy and they want everyone to enjoy watching this film as much fun as they are having making it and I recommend everyone to see that everyone should get a laugh watching it. I also suggest that the actors that you have seen before should see it because they do it for the sake of comedy. Also if the actors in the film are not new I suggest that the viewers still give this film a chance because their talent is not wasted. So I hope you will enjoy this film as much as many other people enjoy
Christopher Nolan directs great movises; I mean, he even did Batman Begin which was awesome, but I expected nothing. It’s nice, not so great and has some flawed concepts, but great for what it is, a thriller. And as I read the original comic, I was interested, and that’ll do for a movie. So I give props to those guys who made it. It’d be great to have a good movie with some good actors in every month of this year, maybe it’d make my top 150, if I do that again. Maybe. But for 1 hour and a few minutes I was in on that movie, and so was everyone who went to look. So it’ll always be a good movie. Inception. Great job. You just need a bit more practice of the concepts. You know you can. But you can’t all the f*cks in the whole movie. But, this is an awesome start guys. Keep it going. If this was the movie they were hoping it would go to, or they weren’t going to make it, f*cks. This movie needed more f*cks. Great job though. Good luck the rest, but Inception. You were the best movie this season when I saw it and you can go in my list of top movies of all times. Good Job and a B+ and fist fulls up.
cultured, art-lofying people who can appreciate the beauty, subtle articulation, and nuance of a good Australian film that has no need of Hollywood special effects or explosive action sequences and is never bored by the pace. It is an Australian film with Australian actors—and what better place is for an artist to make a point about the human situation than in their natural habitat? This is a film about life and death, about our relationship, and about the nature of reality and how we perceive that reality. The Australian landscape may be unfamiliar, in fact strange and frightening to most. This movie should not be viewed as just another albatros, but rather an allegorist and metaphric, a film to be admired. It is definitely a film to watch—twelve times—and then again. It is art cinema, not Hollywood. In the same way that a great opera or chamber piece of music can move us emtspically, this film is art-house cinema at the very top of its game and is worthy to be put alongside many of the greates classies of all times, a film that will stand the rigors and test of a hundred years of time. It has no need of over-hypeted Hollywood advertisements and media hysteria, because when you see this film you will be overwhemled by its artistry regardless of the publicizing it receives. This
until a few days before seeing the trailer. I thought, "Cool, Ben Afflect is on TNT every night...maybe he's going to play for another sport?" It wasn`;t a good idea to find the story on wikipedia and realize what it really was about so I can'a spoil it for anyone but that scene when his daughter is being held on her bed. I`m just not going there. I was a mess after seeing the previews, and I think the movie will give anyone goose-pimplies...for sure. That'd be enough to not want the book if you never read the book before. I`m all about the movie, and if you can handle it and are intrigued enough to read the story, enjoy and be prepared to cry. - Submission By, Kendyl Hutchinson, age13 (10/10/21). You just need a box or tissue. You'll need it. No really. Trust me on the tears. It works out in the plot in the movie. I didn't cry. In fact, it was the most thrillin'est book/book movie adaptation I've ever read/watched, and I've been into those types of stories since Harry Potters and Twighlight(I liked those). It's a really emotinal and dramatic
too much. We don' t need any more of the 16 year high- school drama, with all the stupid fucking gagging and puking. No, it just isn" The best scene though is when he finally decides, after all is said ans done, to go up to him and say, "you f**king c**ts." That"s right, he says, "c*cks." If it was 4 star I would give 3 for the first half and one star to the last 20 mins or 3 stars for 100 min. I didn"t think it was a bad film at first. But I have to admit I was disappointing with the ending, after having gone through so many scenes with the kids, but in the last 1 minute of the 10min scene they say "we"s fuck" and all the shit they were talking was just a waste of time, and just ruined all the film. I think it would have been a lot more enjoyment if they had done the whole 30 minute story in 10 minutes and then put it all back into the story again. I think that was what ruined it. But I was expecting a lot more from this one. I would say 8/ This is a great film and I would highly recommend it, but it was a little long and it was a little annoying in
he is a great one. He made up the entire thing for one of the most amzing stories ever told on TV. If this has not convinced your of the fake-nitude then watch the video. He is going along to the same lines as George Noorey. That he is all making it up. (It's kinda like the Twin Towers thing but not nearly as bad)...or if it is real, you really should stop reading the internet and start a commune in a cave. I'm not sure either way though. Please, Alan, tell us the truth. Or is this what happened, you really are a lord and we live in the most technologcially advance time ever?...you can' wait for the answer either because...you are dead. (I was told I couldn't use the 'dead' phrase any longer as its become very over-done in the last few months and there is a fear that the next line will start 'And...she was a hooker...and she was a meth-fiend....' so I had that line cut) I'll still use it though. Because I'll only get it when Alan is dead. (If that makes any sense) Also, he's already a bit of an aristocrat anyway as he came onto the scene with his family in the 10th Century (8) if we go back that far in English History and he'
me on this if your planning to watch this show it will be a long 40 to 75 minutes of your day but it will be worth it, but it is not for the young kine (i mean young) children as well as some may find the movie disturbng. i recommend for teens and above. for some reason i can really see why this movie was not in a 3d format. it is almost like a virtual reality film but without that. as the film goes along we are introduced to a new character that you will never see from a mile away and when your introduced to it you will say who is that??? it remanded of the creepy feeling as well in the same way like "The Exoricist" did as well as "The Blairwish Project. It'll take you through a whole range of emoitions as well just not the same emotions but in a whole different way as well as you won. If ur not planning to watch this film then your missing all that is good in life and i would really recomend for anyone to watch this movie and if your not into horror movis i would not recomand this movie to any one. trust me this film is like any other film that is out on the net. and i would give the film (6 out 1on1'S) or 6 out on 5 thumbes up. this film is so awesome i watched like
over the top, and the acting is ridicious. However I really enjoyed it and I think its a fun classic camp slasher. Sure the kills have a bit of an after taste when you realize they are being thrown around to be campy and not because the kills are any where close to reality but they are still entertaining. The kiddie camp setting makes the movie so much more campy and the characters are just stupid enough that the movie is still entertainment. This a great camp slasher and I reccommended it for anybody looking for entertaining korean kills. I think if you keep the tongue in the side at the right time you will come to really enjoy this film. So if you are one of the people who hated it or who is looking for a classic with some campy korea kool killz then go ahead and check it out, if your not then stay far away. It will just be 90mins and you will not miss anything by doing so. As always I look forward to your feedback. Also sorry if my writing was not exactly what I usually do, but I was feeling under the weathre of the flu. I hope to be back to normal later today. But for now just know that i'll be back later today to give you a review you wont forget and to tell everyone whats wrong with the movie of the week. Take care everyone. Sorry again for the poor writing
outright hilarous) for those who do! I mean this movie is so bad that're you'll want it to come out on DVD with Director's commentaries and outtake/making of videos, so you can just hear the actors goofing off while filming. So, I do suggest watching this one at the theater as well as the movie. However, I did say that, so I should warn you that this one has no nudity, gore or profanity. I don'thowever, that this will stop the P.I. from watching it. I mean, he'll definitely see it because I'm his wife; however I do see this movie being an acquired taste. If you were thinking of going to the theater to rent this one, you are better of seeing it on VOD. I really have no clue why this was a big budget film, because it was poorly executed, but it was funny, so there's that! If I were to rate it; it would be a 3/5 (not worth the price). Here are my favorite quotes: "It was 1989, and I was on top. I had it all. Looks, career, and a great sense o' humor. But that was a long tim e ago." - Tall, Tall Man. "The best part about a dictaor is you don'
months back. The film, though not on a par of the 11 o'clock programme, is very worthwhile view. In fact, it is a powerful remind of our debtor to the past in terms not only in the sense that we ought to look back and be thanked for what they have given to civilisation, which of us could live well as we live, but also, and more importantly, for having taught the young folk, their children who are our very hope for tomorrow. This is so especially in a place that is so far removed from all the great schools as is this country. The children must be taught by those teachers of the old, lately departed, who have left us a great memory, a rich past which will be forever ours if in our turn we will be responsible and be ready to transmit the same teaching to those waiting for education. I saw this film with great empathie because I feel very keen, and I have written several times on AeF about the need of educating the children, the need of giving to the young folk not just knowledge but also wisdom and also the love for values and for their country, their history, their language, the custom, the way of living that are peculiar ours. I've been doing my little to achieve a few goals in this respect but still much more needs to done, not only by those who have time for reading or thinking, as we do,
a bunch of paint dry'. At least 'Paint Drying', or some such title, would be accurate as it is one of only two things that happen in this film (the other being a man shooting a rabbet, which is not as titular-suggestingly hortifocal as it might sound). In fact, I'll make this review as entertaining as is absolutely humanely possible; that isnÂÂÂt too difficult really. (ItÂâ‚¬tm's hard on the eyes, but then, watching this is hard work). In Ââ‚Źâ's worth, I'd say there's about half an average length episodeÂ’ of 7th Avenue. That is probably the biggest and most positive thing that can actually and genuine be written about this piece. I'm not sure that itÂ’s strictly a horror, and if it were to have been made any longer, it wouldn' t be too difficult for it get over the half hour mark and qualify as a feature. The opening ten minutes is probably a good indication; that, along Ââ‚¬tmis some very low-rent, shoddin' acting, bad camerawork, no direction and an overall atmosphere and directionlessness that just didn'Â’ t ring a bell. The film seems like a badly produced home movie, with a lot of foot in the mouth comments and a whole

quality in, perhaps ever? it's an utterly beloved show and was the biggest show in the US this year so it'a a big show for me and a big risk for Hulu to air it. i think what i love about this show is it'd very well constructed, the writing, sets, characters and dialogues are all super well rounded and the theming of the show and the subplots and everything are all just incredible to me? i was really happy to see that this show is set in and around Chicago because i lived in Chicago and loved that city so it meant a lot more for me to live there. there're so much to love about the show and i can say that i absolutely love it? i've already re-watched the first episode and i've watched the first 5 episodes of S3 already (since it'll already be 2 months in the future and the S4 will already be air in march here in Sweden). i've been keeping up with this show and am watching everything on iPad and iPhone and can say that it is a huge investment and i'm glad i'll still be alive during S6 and that i can also watch S7, S8 and S5 when i'll have watched them in the US. if y'r into crime drama and don;'t watch Chicago Pd, do give The Chicago Franchises a try, i haven
I still enjoyed the movie. It’s a story about two men who are very different and end up together because one is in need. This movie I saw many times on TV and loved it. They did do a re-make of that movie a little while ago but it’s nothing as good! The chemistry is completely different as well as they were not a couple but they were friends. The original movie made the story more excitig. The other movie was very slow moving and nothing was really explained. The original version in my opinion was better. And I still have my copy on TV Guide as a reminder of the original movie in 2-part version. Also I remember reading the book and it was very good as well as seeing other actors in it on TV and at the movies. They also did a TV series with some the same characters. If anyone out there has read “Angie” that is a very interesting book by Elizabeth Sanxagoth. Have to say I enjoy watching old movies as well as reading my favorite authors!

Happy Gardening!……Enjoyed listening to your music….Thank You…Vickie. And thanks to all those bloggers that I am still following….Have fun, stay
it and think I'M the weirdo. I have a theory that the reason why the British are the way they Ae is to blend in their theater roots with their humor. My theory is that in their youth when they were going through theater training they were told to hide any facial expresions and just do the job and act like the character. This is the reason why when a Brit jumps for joy it is an unusual sight. I love it, but my friends just can't get past it. They think I'm the weird guy. I don't care, its soooooooooooo funny. And yes I know that not every British humor is the way I said above, it's only some of the time when the British are having fun. And the thing about the British and their humor and expressions is, they are funny just by being themselves and being a British. We Americans need more British humor training (if that make sense), because its a much funnier way to laugh and joyk. The reason why I think American humor has failed is it is too much like a joke. There's nothing there to hold it together. There are no roots in it. If we just added British blend to the humor we would have a better humor. I mean why has Montserate gotten more famous in Britain than the BBC. (I'm sorry if I spelled some of this

family, romance, science fiction... a truly memorable work. You're not going into a theatre with a big budget looking just for box office receipts. This is more like a great novel that comes alive in film format. For me it'd be like a book that had been adapted for the big or small screen. The film is a work that you'll want back for rewatchings every few years or so for the rest of your lifetime. The film can be enjoyed by many kinds audiances from very young children up to mature adults of any sex. I don t understand why some people do rate it so low. In my opinion, even if you dont agree with the theological aspects of the films, it is a must see film, to be watched at least once in a lifetime. 16th October, 12:02 AM #145: 10/24 - 50th anni.

the actors. They are terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The music is incredible. All this is in the good ZOMBIIII style. I was really excited after watching it because I can' t get this film off the tip of my brain. What I mean is I love it, like it, hate it, love the idea of it. It'll stay on the top of my to watch list for a while now until another movie or film or something else takes its place for a while of me loving the bad ZomBIIIIIi. Lucios film was awesome, and it's trashed. That'll teach you to go back and watch a film that was so bad to begin. With that said, I need a break from trash. So I'm watching a film that is considered to be excellent. This film is a modern classic, a cult film that is very famous and is often referenced in other moviies, a film with a great score and sound effects and an amazingly written and well written story. I've decided to get a break from trash and watch Ringu, which will probably be my favorite horror film forever. I love it. Everything about it is so well done, so beautiful, every little thing from it's score to it'sa actors, it feels like they put all their love and attention into it and it shows with every second of it. I would have made this a
in it. But the main culprit for this travistky: the director of the film is Steven Soderberg! He is the reason the movie failed. Soderberge had been working in theater for over 25 years when he decided to make his first movie, Sex Lies & Videothere. It turned out great, but that has not been the norm in the directors career after that movie hit and he has become a star director in Hollywood, but he still seems like a little boy looking for attention by doing everything wrong. He makes horrible moviesthat have very little substances. The director has a serious problem with the scriptwriting: he is lazy when it is time for him to work; he will make changes and cuts as he desires because apparently those are the ways to “make the script work and be more appealing to the audience and critics,” Sounds like a good argument, but S.Od. has never done a movie with as much depth and as much potential as Cheap Thrilloh, the worst of his movies sofar. You can not argue that Sodesburg has not had enough money since all the projects he worked on had large budges, but you can say that he spents his cah on the wrong things that should not be there for any good director. If he spent the money in a better place or made cuts to remove unnecessary scenes and cuts from good scenes
run video. I still laugh at this one and think Troama deserves it to stay up a couple extra years as it made Troama laugh and for that I'm very grateful! Now that said, Troama is not responsible for the music selection, I'm going with one of Troama favorate artists. The choice is yours in what to do with the videos. Tro has tried several ways, but Tro can not figure out how to embed a video from youtube without it losing quality, so that's why in the meantance Tro has not updated a couple of these as well as the "I Can Be Your Mom" video. Sorry, but Tro is not going to go there again. If you have something nice for the new movie, Tro would love to see it in the commemt section! Tro, your old buddy, Troma. Thanks guys! And a lot of love to the old group I was in, The Talking Heaters, I'd like them all to comment here, or even better, come to Chicago and perform again with me at the old bar in the 49th Ward. Maybe we can even book Tro and the Heaters as a cover group and perform in bars and other venues. Thanks, Tro. Again! I'm not a movie buff at all, I just had to get some things off me chest for a long long long time. Sorry, but this was just another
personal struggles with kindness. There was genuine love shown to all the characters and I don't recall ever feeling that people were being judges, even in very difficult situations. I enjoyed all the actors, and the filming locations were terriffc. A good time at the theatres or at home. The main character was very funny and belivable. I don'f find the humor depressing, although it is sad, it is realistic and fun to watch her grow and change, and the people around here change too and in a beautiful, hopefilled, way. If you want uplft or even laughter, this is the film. You might even like a good cry. I do both and love every minute of this wonderful film. Likely to see it again when I get the DVD. I highly recmened it to you if it does not offened you. It did take me by surprised in places. I've always loved Janeane Garafalo and this performance is my new favorite; she was wonderful! and her "voice" was great (I really hate that soundtrack though and have found the music unpleasing so far; perhaps I'll like it after a couple of listenings, but just now I can only find it annoying). I love Paul Dillon and really enjoyed his part here. I don;'t really remember who played the part very well, but the young

with Kevin Kline and the rest is history. It's a fun romp and I like it! It is a very cute and sweet movie, though I wish it was a little shorter because we just didn' t need the whole bumbling idiocy plot. I can totally see why it is such as classic because not only was this one of Meg Ryan’s first roles, this was a film before all the "chicks flippin’" craze and also when "romantic comedic movi This was really fun and sweet movie to watch. My only complaint was that I felt it was kind of dragged out in some parts and a little slow. That and the fact that I felt the characters were a little over done but still funny. But that didn t put a big dent on how much I was laving this light and fun little romantic comedy. It’ll never be my all favorite rom com, but it s pretty high up there on that list. It s definitely worth watching just to have some cuddle weather fun. I can definitely see why this is such an icon! A good fun movie and I like it! "He'S Just My Boy Friend, You Can Sleep Here Tonite" (Wow, so 8O' ) I gave this movie a 8/10 on netflixtvdb! My rating for this movie : I loved most everything and the only
couldn' t say that I found it as a good film as I would expect it to be. I have a deep admiration for Leonesse' films, so I tried to give it a second change, and now at 3 in one evening when I have had my dinner I still can'nt quite see the whole point. My main problem is with Toni Servillo as the character Titto. I felt that this role was badly mishandeld by both Servilo as the character, the director, and his writing. Maybe you have a lot of sympathy and admiration to him, but as soon as they started to show all the negative side you can'nt quite see the good side again. I felt that the film was very repetative, and although it might have had a deep meaning I could not see what it could be. The film is very slow, but also quite boring, since you just see this one character talking the whole time. The sound is also extremely awful - I have heard worse in student films. Overall a disappointment for my expectation of this great director. If you have not seen the film, I can not recomened it. If however you are die hard fan of Leoneses' films I guess it'd still good to see. I would recomend it to a film class as an example of a good film, but don't bother for the viejewr who just wants to see something else. For
Online or in the theaters; this film is the worse! It is a waste. Don\’tt waste your money or 2 hours of life seeing it in a theatre. Please!!!!! I am sorry I made you all suffer this pain. It was the worst, for me. I hate this movie. I can\’tt say anything positive about it, even if I tried. Please do not see this movie. Please!!! Please!!! Please!!! Save your time and money. Please!!!

Gresham (George Sanders), a British millionaire, takes great pleasure in humiliating the very people he depends on. He has a secretary (Barbary Ryan, above) who is loyal and hard- working, but is constantly put down by Sir Aubury who insists he should fire his only two personal staff; a man servant (Royal Dano) and a maiden (Rosalyn Bledsloe) whose duties consist of preparation and presentation, iow. she serves tea to her employer several minutes before he arrivies home. One day the man- servant resigns and Sir Gresham is faced with a dilemama. He is forced, then forced further, into employment of an idealistic young man called Jack who arriving at the door of the house with his card and a letter from Aubury's secretary, who states Jack works for her brother-inlaw. Jack is a Communisr, a dis-illusioning idealist, a poor working man, and an unemployed vetran with a family in dire straits because of his inability to work. Jack (Keen Young), a young man full not only of ideals but also integrity, is a man who must be put in the most humilating positions to show how low and disgrateful the rich are and he soon learnt that Sir Greshams' two ladies are
’m such a big Kevin Spacey fan (in this kind a film and The Ref of course). The film is loosly set during Georgina’ is reign and is about two street thugs that are both fighting to survive 200 years on. I think it is pretty original and funny, plus Spacey kicks some serious ass (no kinkiness of-course) , and if your interested in a decent historical action/advent film and you need a giggly laugh or 2 then you should definitely check it out! Enough said. 6/13/21 (78) 78/211=3.8604055 (1) 1/2 3.8533208 0.3984= 1. On one side, you have the king. On another, you have the queen. Who’ll win? That is the theme of this film. And this is one of several films in which the king and queens had a very active personal lives (as well as the royal family and politicians). The film is about the life of a king and a queen (one is a queen, the others is a king). It’s about two characters who have different personal lives, but who also share the power of the king (the king of the king). The king and the queen live in the same palace, but
another spin through an old favorite of our household. I'll never forget the night I first saw this film. I was visit the Bauer household and they were watching something. I had no idea what they had on until they told me it'd been on their "must see" list for some time now. I didn'y think too much out it at first. Then a commercial came up, one for a movie called The Ring. I'd been seeing those creep-show commericals a few times recently around this time and thought the Ring ad would have been a lot scarer if it had those guys from Dukes Of Hazzart as the characters. So this time around, watching the Ring made even less sense than the first! But heh! It made me laugh. Anyway! I'm sure all you who have watched the Ring more recently will agree with the great film I saw this past weekend. Great film and a fun one for my little ones! Happy Halloweening! -DG. P.SS. -I haven"' t seen the american remake yet so it wouldn' t be fair for me to discuss it with this post but the remake is getting decent ratings so far! I saw the first Ring back at the drive in! It was my first time seeing it and I have never watched it again since so that should be enough to qualify to me of it's good qualities as a
sick from school for a week and I watched this movie everyday. I love the story and the music, and its one I’ll always cherished for the rest my life as something that has helped shaped the person I am today. And the sequel, Hair Metal Shark Week was awesome too. I know I’ll eventually watch all 4 of them when they’s all available. They’re like “Troll II” in the regard of weird horror movies that are so weird, they’ll grow on you if you’ve seen them enough times, and that’ll be the case with this film. I love it, its awesome, you should love it too. I’ve been watching it since I was a kid. You’ll have to pry it from my dead, clawing fingers. 5/5 (100%). Check out the trails, and you’ll see why, because it’s crazy. It has a song that I think is one of Elvis Costello best, which is “Almost Painted A Picture.” You’re welcome for the awesome song choice on your next movie night out. 7/5 (143%). A perfect film. 5/5 (100%). I recommend this movie. 5+/5 (100%). You’re lucky to have a chance to watch and enjoy this movie. I’ll
it was a little boring (although I might have been in the mood for horror anyway). The other thing I remembered is the line, "You have an uncivil way with a cranium." How would you describe that? Oh well, my memory is starting to fade. It didn' t hold a torch to the book, but I think it was a little too gore-centric for its own good, plus it seemed like it was missing some of Carrols humor and playfulness (I guess thats what happens with a film from 1959 and a book published in 73 - a time for a difference in writing moods, I guess?). I think that the movie is worth reading the book it is loosed upon before watching - there are many scenes you can just see playing out on a screen with a few dialog changes, but otherwise it's a good adaptation. 5/5 stars.… Collier 22:09:06 - 03 Jul 09 The movie was great, I read The Graveyard Book at my friend's bday, and i started reading it at 1:00, so I finished the whole freaking book by bed, and it's 4 am and i couldn’t sleep so I went onto netflixto see if there were a gravedigress and i was so upsetted to see there
I was quite skeptrical about this one. I was so pleasantly surprised! I loved this movie so much more than The Wolfman, but then, again, I didn not expect to like it. I loved the acting, the visual style and that it actually was about people, the environment. Also, the storyline felt more realistic. It felt like a movie about real human feelings and experiences and struggeles and not the Hollywood version that is so much about explosions etc. I totally recommend you to see this, no matter if original or American version. Great acting and an interesting story. And beautiful, too. 8/6/2015 (Doug) I thought the American version was pretty damn good, the original not bad, but there is something really compelling about the first film, it may be the innocense but it certainly is the visual and musical landscape (which is the same for both though). The scene where Chris gets his hands on his first victim and realises she is no longer the pretty thing she used too be is so well written. 8/31 (DarkRider) I'd seen the trailers and heard a lot of bad stuff about this reimagened Witchfindar General, but it was actually one the most refreshingly different horror pieces I have seen in a long time! The casting was good, the acting was excellent from everyone and the whole movie seemed like a

. I didn't really like the film and after watching the first third of its time-span I decided not bother with the rest of it so I set a timer to delete the tape anour and half hours later. On arriving in the flat to find the taped-over box. I realise that the tape had started from around 10 minutes of the film ending after the main character is murdered at a party and all you see is the police taking away his body. The taper hadn’t deleted it at all. But after a little investigation I found it had been recorded in PAL which is a very good thing because if it was in SEC it would of been a waste! This was only the second PAS tape I'd seen that I could actually use, though its not as good as a taper because it leaves around a 10 to 35 minute blank at the beginning. I've seen a lot over time that were PAS but I just threw in the bin because it was such poor quality. If you look at the image of the back of the tape it doesn\'t say anything about a code and its not marked 5 or above so it must of just recorded straight on to it without stopping. I didn't check out whether the tape was PAS all this I only found out much much laters. (The first POS tape that I'd found was in
ever seen. I've seen a lot, but this was by far my favorite. It's very realistic and beliveble with its actors, and also a big factor in its realistictude with the sound. It was a great script, and the fact it was filim is a huge bonus. I'm not a big fan on remakes, but this was so much more better. To those people out there who think remakes are stupid and point-lessly done, I highly recommend this film to you. It is not a remake or even inspired by some old Hollywood film; it'ss actually an original. It's just that the story line is too similar and the fact there are so many parallels to it, I guess it gives the idea that they've just copied it, or used someone else's idea, but that is not so. If you haven't yet, see it. I know I'll watch many times in years to com.… Colour me impressed. Just as a few commentors mentioned below that the plot of this film was unbelievable/unbelievibly stupid, let me explain the film for you. The "plot holes", or the "logic" behind the decision making of some characters, are merely examples of the "human error" and the lack to predict the "enemey" that was the Japanese during war. If only the Allies would have anticip
actually a very good movie as well-made moviemaking should be with it having been done by the same director of My Neigiant Proff. I give it 8 out of 12: I'am not sure why it seems not to have been release. Maybe it's not the type of movie they'd get away with over here? I don't know, I didn;t realize what it actually meant until after it was over. It seems it's all about how women are aborbing and they can've be abused. I'm not going into detail with this I would advise you do go and see it at a theater if possible, it was really good. I'd give 8 out of 12. I'am only rating this movie based on the fact that I saw it without knowing anything about it. As a movie it was very well made and well script. It would seem to me that the whole of the story could have been done with less than half it's runing time but it would probably be a better film. I will say that I did feel sorry for the women that were involved in the story. The only reason I gave the movie a 7 out 10 it was just too long. It almost felt that to me that it was made for a different audience that wasn'm interested it was too long. As a film it was beautiful. It was an interesting film
a delightful film. The title doesn't do this film justice - it is a movie that deserves more attention. "The Pirate is truly a hidden gem among movies of the 'MGM Hollywood era'. The movie is a musical based in 19th century France and the Caribbean. It takes us back there through the music, the danicing and some fine and beautifully costumed actors and sets. Gene Kelly is charismat... read the rest and watch online with amazon video! or with net-flicks! or on dvds! or just rent it with amazon video! with net fikks or dvds or rent them all by amazon! for all the genres! there is the perfect movie! the pirates ship looks so gorgeus and romantique, and all the action scenes - and the fight scenes - are so wonderful! i like best, that the movie was not a copy of a real historical event like The Merchant-of Venus - and that it was so unpoliticized (like so many Hollywood movi- of that era) - i can remember that i loved the movie as child with my parents, because it is so beautiful! it is a real feast for the eyes, the music is beautiful and funny and the characters so much to love. this movie can make me so often so happyl to be human being - and to be born in germeny in the 8
the players, their names etc, but after twenty seconds the images of what is happening in front of my TV screen are brea..king my heart. The scenes of the after-math are even worse, and it'd better be one year later. I know, I watch too many movies, and it's almost impossible for someone who is interested in acting like I am and who has watched almost every scene of Dirty Harry a hundred times to see a movie and feel nothing when he looks at the movie and thinks "Oh that gu....!" or hears the actors talk to one another, but it's different when my heart is really breaking. It happened to my wife when she watched La Reine Margo (the Marquis de Saderne) and it happened to me when I saw this film. I think I should reconsid..ring. My wife has been right all along; you know, her telling that she wasn´..t interested in the movie, and that all these old French classics (that I saw in the moviethe..ater as my daddy took me to see them), she just wouldn't get it, because she just didn' ...t share our experiences... She was probably rigth, just like when we had the same fight about watching Sartana and all those others movi..ees, with the same result. That's because she has never been able..to understand, and maybe because
deafness in guppys. After his lab rat, a guppy, gets eated by one of Dr. Frank-N-furter's lab assistnats, Dr Frank goes to steak out Dr. Markoff to try and get Dr. Frank's serums to cute off the tail . As far as the experiment goes and how to actually stop or control is the problem. And the movie ends with the guy being chowed as Dr Markoff says he is doing the experiment. And as Frank tries saying he is not. He says he is just trying to get information. I think its kinda weird how he was eaten by Dr Frank. It was an amazing ending. A great movie! I give it a 5 out of 5 stars and a thumbs up! I love the song "Hot Patootie." I had the chorus at my weddi g and it was fab. The movie is one to get and watch over and over. My favorite scenes in this classic are: Dr Fronkt is talking to his assistants about the eating of Dr Markoff. Dr Markoffs scene before he has gone over to Frank' s place. Also when R&J are going over to Dr Frank and there are all the lab girls waiting to pick Dr Franks up after he makes them wait and R&J drive off with the guppy to take him over to Dr Markoffs. Also the scene of
and worse angel that inhabit our being and most certainly,of course in its end,this is a big fat statement about love,and to end up with a big fat statement,you can never go wrong. So,it is very smart and very stupid. It is very smart because we have a cast that is made of some of the biggest icons of our time in such a way that this cast will keep you engaged and glue you at your seat and will surely,not,make your head spin.So that' right there,is a smart move by all involved that will probably leave a very big smile on your face. However this cast is also very dumber than a brick in a way that this movie is a very bad version of a road movie with the best cast ever assembled since... well,ever,since the beginning of cinema. I guess I didn’ t expect anything different from a movie of Tarantinto. I guess I didn’t expected this movie to give me so much pleasure and so many good memoirs of the best moments since Jackie Brown up to this date. This is a brilliant movie and a big love letter to the genre. It really makes Tarinto an icon in my eyes and he sure will be for a long time now,for me at least. 5 stars without doubt. A big, big big BIG thank you goes to my friends JOE & RYAN who went down south in Florida to watch
of the best Bond films, and one of the most fun, because it's not really serious. So much of that is taken here. There is an attempt by the Bond franchiser to move the series back to being escpiongey, and it's worked pretty well with a script that has just the amount of humour that it really needed, whilst not being silly and unfunny. There's an excellent cast that has to be admireed. They really are at ease in their parts, even more so for Jinx... who I was not expecting much of, and was pleasantly shocked with her. She really did a wonderful impression that I wasn;t used too. This, unlike most of the Craig ones... this one actually works as escpionage and a really excellent plot. Some of it may have gone over your head, but I didn;t feel that it was necessary to have to watch the film twice through. Just a lot more fun to enjoy and an extremely well made movie... despite the fact that it'w not the strongest in my opinion. But still, a really fine film worth of any collection and worth seeing.

one film and in very few other moviegoers’ minds… In this “suspense comedy” (how’ s it possible?), Thomas Bo, who is a policemen, receives the call of a suicidal person. The call itself sounds as a real suicide attempt on the caller side (he uses his mobile as a no longer working suicide machine). He is going there, and on the way he has several meetings with “suicidal personalities” who are not what he thought: a drug addict kid who jabbed himself with a hypodoche and needs help, a guy who was stabbed with a dagger (and survived), a couple of young women, and so forth. While Bo is searching these people for an attempt, a real suicidal person turns up in front his home, ready for action with a gun. Well, this is what happened to me while watching the Danish film Suizid (aka Suizide). I was thinking about suicide. That’s the way the movie affects you. This absurdo-comedy is the kind of movie you can’t really believe you watch. But you don’ t care, at least I didn t care and I have to admit that I really enjoyed watching it. I felt like a part the “insane” atmosphere of absurdo. The absurdeness of this movie comes from the plot, which I didn’
(The Witches by Roahl. Dahl) that has all the makng of a successful novel adaptation; it features an exceptional talent (Anglo. Diddle) as the Director; it stars some top notch British and American actors (Hagrid, Winsty, the Chief Warden, the Chief Whip, the Prime.Minister, the Cabi.Net.,.); and has the best of British and American Technicians behind it. But it is also a film doomed from the outset. You can hardly blame Angloc Dahl. For he is an author who wrote what he thought would be a children' s favourite and became one of. the. best and most. popular children'.books eve. The film.much, like any film,.is a very subjective thing, an emotional experience. I will admit I enjoy the book much more as an entertaining divertissement.

Eric Banal, and Bridgette Benson as his daughter, and Tiffany Wilson, and Bill Hunter (a long list of people I adored) as Eric's friend. I think this movie is unavailable now as it is out-of-date and not very good. But there are some hilarious scenes. I don' t buy anything except a little cheese. I just hope the movie is eventually brought out again as I will probably buy it when it does come back in print in some way. It is worth the money spent. It makes you want a bit of Aussie-ness. (I have seen a few AUS tv shows from that era and I agree, the 1820'S series' were very good!!) I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I watched a lot in those 1820 years as I was there a few times. My cottontree is so big now I get the pruner' out! My Mum was a nurse in the same hospital as Eric Banal) and Brenton, who had the same disease too late to save him and I met my Husband at work, he was a naughtie boy, so I left and when he came to see me, he was too late, too many years later) so I found out, and he was a lovely man in my hospital and the 6th floor where
in the opening minutes of the film to the specific movements of the protagonist's hands when he's playing. It'll leave viewers thinking and perhaps a bit distempered but the film deservesthe attention and care that must be paid to it to understand it properly. It won'tspark many smiles, but it will make you think. It'ssad but it may just end with a glimmer. High recommendation, especially if that glimpsein this film might make you think and reflect on what you see. If that'stherole of what a film should be then "A SeriousMan, A SeriousFilmmaker" should really appeal. Highly Recommed. Don'tenjoy this for the comedy, the comedy isn'tdark, just for a lot of "what'sthe hell?!" moments. The comedy will be subtle, but it's in there, I swear. Iwas so entertainted with this, and I was so entertained and enthraled with this, I was laughing my ass off. The way the film is written, it'sclear that Cronenberg was thinking of the actors for his films, since the actors are all really good at playing their parts and they play their characters very nicely, so the film is actually more of a film that is written by the writers as opposed too much. I am glad that he'
a movie with such high potential for the first two and a third minutes, with all the mystery and tense, it would have done so well. But then when you watch the rest, all the tension was wash off and replaced with laugh out moments. Forgettable, yes but still funny. The ending was very uncalled as the film makers just decided to ignore all the rules. But still worth a view. The characters were so shallow. This is just a simple film with very little complexity. I really don't have anything else to add. It's a short, fun, laughable viewing film. It's just too ridiculous and silly. It's like there was no story. Oh well. Just for fun. Not really anything of worth. I'm sure you can find it somewhere and if you do, I suggest watching only part of the movie and not the entire thing. It should make sense. It could end early or late or both. Just enjoy it for the simple, fun and humour this has to provide. It did what is supposed. To entertain. But still it was silly. It'll give you a good time if that's all that'll you want. 5 /10 and not really something I'm recommeding. Just an average film. It could go either direction and either way would suffice the same. Just something to watch. It has its own charm
know a lot of characters. It’ s great to meet your family and i like it that everyone speaks Spanish in his/ her mother tongue. It’s about the Spanish history in New York. I think it is interesting because you see a whole lot about what was going in New York many many years ago and how these people made a lot their dream in the United Sates. The actors and actress do amazing things, I have to appreciate the actors who make this movie interesting. The best scene of the movie is when the family is meeting up at the hospital and they are waiting for a little girl named Rosa to arrive and she arrive with a cake in her hands. You know she is the daughter that they have looking for, I enjoyed it because it is very funny. I think people are going to like this film a little bit more, I hope there’re going enjoy the film as i do. This movie has to do with the Spanish history in New York but I will always remember it for all the good things that happen with the main actor, his name was Benito Juarre. I don´t want to give out the movie but i will say is a interesting story about how these families were moving together with so many family in Newyork. The movie is called” El hombre de Brookly” and i liked the name. I hope you guys enjoy the movie. See you next week. Bye By: Javier S.A
make a decision between his two loves. I have to say though the guy he kissed on the island is really trying his patience! Im happy to see that Casey really enjoying his school and friends now that hes not stuck in the islands. I loved the episode when the nerdy girl hit the hot guy and he got all mad. That was too funny, he was really pissed, I have to laugh. I do wish that they would put some more songs on this show but its all great still. Ive seen the first episode of season Two and I loved the episode and was excited to see the next one but sad to see it end so soon:(.

creativity on 24 frantically busy tracks. Even The Avalanche Beatles document from 1960 has been considered, as was an uncreditable 29-minutes Beatley feature, called “The Beatles: A Hard-Day’s Night”, which ran on an ABC-TV special in July 1981. The idea for “Let It Be” was suggested to George, Linda and David Lodge, the producer of the London stage version of “Jersey Boys”, which had premier in 2a September. They wanted to tell the story behind John Lydon, Pattie Boo and The Bonds, as well they had in mind a series, that would tell the story beyond George’. They would make a two part mini series, with the first one, being on 16 August © 5, showing George’, George Lydon, Patsy Booth, John Paul, Julian and Julian Paul Lange, followed by “The Bride of George”, showing George, George Lydon & Patties Booth on the stage of the Liverpool Philharmonics Hall. As a taster, George’, John, Patties Booth and Julian would all make guest appearances on “The Late Show” on the 22nd August. The mini episode would be aired in July, and then on September 9 & 10,
ran along. This isn't a big disappoint as this was only the second time in 2005 that I wanted the film to stop. It' not that it'a bad, far from it, but it had too narrow focus to be able to hold itself together for the full film. I think that the best film Sayles directed was Miami Blues, because it was the best story. Other than this flick his most recent was Lone Stars, but again this is a good film, but the movie had a too narrow range. I really thought that this film would be his first to cross the 15k line, so as a movie it didnâ take to long to cross itâ€�s own 2 year line. However I still think that this is a good film. I think it just needed more work to make the main characterâ s arc clear to everyone. As one poster put it, his arc made you forget the film you were seeing, I have never been more disappoint in the character arc than I have for this film... I have to watch it sometime to get it straight, because it seems to be on the verge to making something great, but falls just short in the end. I also think that the film was rushed, since it seems to be a film about characters talking about other characters, or talking in general. I think it was just rushed in a lot and I have no problem
/48 hrs. style than the music is for you. If you were there it was a must see. There are alittle over a dozen punk bands playing. Most of the bands are originals except for a few covers. Everyone that appears in the film is playing, writing, & recording songs. This film will take you on a journey down memorylane. This movie plays 80'S hardrock. The film stars punk rock bands including The Upharers, The Dumps from Seattle Washington and more. If your a punk/rock fan and remember the times on 638 Broadway, Manhasset, NY and other places that had hard rock music and punk clubs in the 79, through 88 that music was for you. A few of the bands also played and released albums such at The Dumps & The uphaweres. There are about 23 songs on the sound track. All 80'S rock & roll, hard rock, punk, and new wave. You will definitely want to hear these sound tracks as a cd or single disc. The DVD is 70 minutes. This is a true hard-bopper, and for the real punk roocker, and if your still listening & following music than you should find this video interesting to watch and hear. This movie is for real fans of the classic 2nd wave hard rock, punk music, and rockabilly bands. This film is
believe it had something like the same ending as it does but still not completely. Not bad but not good either. I think it was meant more for young people because it is just silly. The actors were great though and I have been to their site and it is amazing. I would like to have the book because the movie does miss a lot of important things but then on the website they put little things that are in the book on every page if the movie is going to fast. This makes the book more interesting than the movie and I like it more than the movie. I was a little put off at the end with the way they left the movie but still not bad at all if you like it. They did put out some new special edition on a DVD where they show how they filimed a lot and how they had to do a lot and show the behind scenes. This is very interesting. I would get this one. Over all it is good to watch the movie for something different but not much else to go over but they have good talent and this one is worth looking into. I didn' know this until someone from the website emailed to tell me I should see it and I loved the movie. A lot. I like a good romantic comedy and some times the movies are to predictably but I still like them. So don;' think I made much sense on this comment.

love how they have no dialog and it is completely understood as to what is going on. I will buy this asap when it is available on DVD. Thanks for letting the world know about this movie! I'll also be reviewing this on Facebook so that others see it. Thanks to the producers of this movie for such a creative masterpieCE! 5Stars! I look foreword to seeing what other creativity you come out of the box with next! Keep up the great work. Thank YOU!! The whole point is to tell a story in the most minimalist way, using only what is absolutely crucal to telling it, and not much else at all. I find it very clever and fascintating to see what they were able get away the very least amount possible. Great Job. There is not always a need "A million words" as the famous old quote goes. Just a few are sometimes more than enough. I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything. But there seems a need for the average film reviewer to see moviemakers as gods and demand a greater level and more than is necessary to tell a story. It'd take a few months for me just to sit down and see how long it would actually be. The film seems like one of the highest quality I've ever seen produced by an indie filmmaker, and it's been a long time! I've seen many that

I was immediately attractive to its style. Like other music directives from Tin Man creators Chris Yost and Bartos, "Bewitched" has its tongue firm in cheeks, and its main focuses are physical and visual comedy. (British actors might seem a little too low-key, as if they're reading off-camera to us, for American audiencres weaned by broad humor, but that didn't turn me or my kid off). There just seems such fun in watching the gang do the things in this episode's title. I like that "Bewitched" keeps in the spirit (but, of all places and ways to say so, in a minor way understates it) the "slapstick" (that't a pretty old term in 2D-animations, and not even the first one used about "Bugs" Bunny/Loon Tunes) from those earlier animated cartoons. It's the way that they go about doing what their characters do. There is even a glimpse of a "Who Framed Mr. Bug?"-style snafuf. There really isn’t much to critic here – the only thing I would say is to not to laugh at the gang too har har har for the episode's gags to work or even go over your head (though this is probably a minority of the k
getting worse. It'a time for families to enjoy what we can of the holiday season. I've already seen a few movies and this one just made me angry. The fact that they tried to cash-off on the success and popularity of The Princess Diaries is beyond reproachment, in terms that the characters are not even the ones from Princess Diaries. To make this even worse, they made them younger than they are and so now when they become older in the "sequel", they are way past the normal age range of people wearing school uniforms, which in my case, made me feel old. It's one reason (though not the only one), I don;t go and see movies like Harry Potters, and so on.... It's also ridiculously stupid to have them try a love story with the two princsesses from different kingdom. It'll be one reason I'm goingto stop watching the new Disney movi e-thingy'z they're coming up with next. Why even bother creating something like this when the original is the best one we have? If you don't know what original I want to tell you about, then watch the version that I think is even better that it' is. I can not take a better Christmas than this one, it just came out on dvds and in the store. It has even better animation and the sound effects are actually a lot

It has everything what a slash film needs. Great suspense and horror (not just gimmick gori), great actors and a great plot with all those interesting twists.

. Micheal is a hitman who is assigned a job to kill a corrupt politician. He then gets hoodwaked by a hitman (Al Capones). So he is then assigned the same hit and he is in a situation where he needs a family to protect. So to stay away from Al and the mob he gets a family to protect. He is sent with his wife (Rose)and kids. He has a little boy, Henry, and two older girls, Connor, Anne. During the movie Micheals family is killed one by one for trying to protect MIcheal. The movie leaves you not knowing whether Micheak survives or not the movie has a sad and nostalgic end in which Micheak survivies by leaving his kids in a orphan farm and runs off. They all live happily end. I recomend you watch this movie because it is funny and nostolgic and leaves you wanting a better ending which does not happen until the actual end. The movi is very fun to watch and I recomend it so much. It also teaches some major life values like "Family is what you make of It" "Family is what matters" I can't wait for the new movie in 3 years from now!!!! I suggest this to any movie watcheres except people who get depressed easily. So, thanks for tuning into a new review. I promise you will
a bunch or group of young adults get trapped in a house where a series or events will lead them being killed one by one by an unstopping klller dressed in a bizzare-but-coherently made mask, which will be found by the last few surviving kiddos. One by one the klller is killed. One by the end the kller is killed. Happens all the time at this phase. We have seen everything before. But this one brings the concept to a new level and makes a point of it. And it does so in an ingenius way. We follow the group of college students, one by each, as they make the long way through a foggy and iced countrineside to the place where all the events occur: an old house, in its twighlight years. We know where a bunch of them are going, but we are just as scare as they, and so we wait and wait, and wait, for something to go wrong, until our patience comes to an abiss, which is how i feel about all of this by now: there is so much time for nothing to really happen and then finally, at the end, some shit goes DUH DUH DUH DUUHHH DDUDUDUUDDDD, and then it'sfucking over, and we all die.

pink gorrah. I hope everyone had their requests met. This film is a classic but this edition just makes the whole thing more palatable for those who don’t know or haven’T seen the original. The new commentary and documentaies are very good and informative without being boredom induing and there is plenty to see here that hasn’T before seen the public before now. There is plenty of behind the scene and back lot stuff and even some of John Carpentar’es personal photos of his time on the set. The audio is very clean and even sounds great in 1/13th the original aspect ratio, and who ever did the transfer of this new footage does an adamant great with the rest of whats here and this is truly one fine package for the film and its fans everywhere. I think everyone who is a fan of this film will get something out of this new edition and if you donT own this then I can’T recommend this release enought but you’d be insultin’ Al Cliver if you don;t pick this edition of it and not just the 13 minutes of unratted footage.

acting, bad script and bulls**tt plot, is way below average. You can’t expect the series to be good after the second one. The director tried to make it a comedy and failed. The actors just can not act for s*%ts sake. It was so bad I went back to the first and second just to refresh what was good. Save your money and your day. Skip it. Pure poop. 1 outta 5. Liked the new 5th element movie more….sigh, I am losing it. A shame they could have kept this franchises alive. R.I.P….RISE OF GRINDOLF, DESTROYER ASTANGA and THE ROBIN, the last guardian. Loved those three. But then, what do I know, I liked Iron Sky 666, so what do you know? Hah! A man can have his own taste. Good by…..oh, yeah, I liked that too. Ha! Ha! Ha….ha! Oh s***, here I go, laffing at myself again…..Ha! Ha!.…Ha! Ha! Hah….ha…hah!!! Ha…..aaaaggghhh!!! I’m going to stop this here…and now, I’ll see if I can make it to the third one. Ha!Ha
but it really, really doesn'tt work at the level of a drama about a young man who is unable/unready to tell/say that one sentence "Yes" that means he wants the love of another man. This is a long film and while it does have good points, it could have done with about ten to 10 minutes of script writing and editing. I feel like an amateur for the level of the filmmaking and of course, I am - and for sure it is the most unrealistic film ever, but in terms of real life stories about coming out of homosexuation in an Indian family, I can name do many many times worse. So that was not the film's intention I'm sure and it wasn´th the film's intention to be more than what it is, but that'sh all I think. Itsh like the director has been given a lot of money and has spent it all on this one little film. I don" t believe for one second that I'll watch this film more times, but I might give more of Indian films from other film makers a try. This one was alright, not for everyone, but not bad either, and a good start of something more in this field. Maybe not, who knows. But it sure has made me think a lot of different things, that I didn´th like that much, if at all but they were thoughts I've had anyway.
sit up and turn the sound volume up high, especially when it goes for the "BOO!" factor by using a few well known horror movie monsters in flashbacks (or flashforward), etc. This kinda scare just isn't scare, in my humble opinion. I'd rather not see a movie that leaves the audience cheering at every cheap "boo!" gag, but rather see a movie based on real horror. 'Drac 2', for example, has several cheap-boos, yet the film also presents some genuine moments that actually scare people without the need to resort so much on "boing-boom-chug-chug". 'D3D 96' actually uses very little "chicken skin tension" style moments, and instead, relied on real fear, suspending the audience in the air of anticipated fear. 'Dracula 30' (2002), also does this. These are the kinds of horror films I look forward too; the ones not afraid to scramble up the viewers' brains. '1' isn' t afraid it seems, but I'm not sure what else it's afraid of. The story is, again is a bit silly, I know, for "A Nightmere on Elm street", but it's a better story than this one seems. The characters seem more or lack

in the fact that he can create a world in a span of only a half hour, the dialog is very good, and the characters are like the people you go home every day and see. You care about the characters. You will have different feelings about the characters, but you still care about the ending of the movie. This really is an independent film and I' m glad it was made into a movie. The movie is very fun to see and a lot of laugh. If I had one complaint, and it's a big one, the film is shot through a hand held camera, and it is sometimes very difficult to follow the action, especially when there are a lot people. It' really takes you a while to figure things out, but it is worth the effort to follow it. The film is really an indy-type film, but it is well worth watching because of it's uniquely indy-type quality, which I have yet to see from it, but it is fun. This film has some of my favorite music in it and the film is well shot. It is good to see independent filmmakrs making films, and this is good because it gives us something to look forward to, and also because the film is very fun and very funny. It is worth your time. It is good to have a film like that, but you can' have one of those films every weekend. I give this movie 7/ 
a bad 90s movie. I think maybe if I had some friends around while I watched, it'd be better, but it just feels too...cheap...in terms of direction, writing, and acting(though the acting is quite...good?) - I suppose you know exactly how you feel. I haven´t seen it either, but reading the plot I think it´s a bit too heavy on teenage angst for me. I´m already going to see "The Imitation Game." I haven´ t read the book, but I expect it will be a good story. It sounds like it was on the list last year. I'm so glad you're still writing; love reading all of it--especially since I got to see most of it happening! I´ve been to the cinema once this week. I didn' t see any moview, because I went with my boyfrien to see some of my friends who were visitng from Berlin. I don' think that there are any good movies out in the cinema right no, so we just went there for the social contact and some drinking, which was also very fun :) I'll let you into a little secret. I've seen The Hobitat, and The Lord of the Rinfs. That was two weekends in row because I just had nottin g to do. So I enjoyed the moviews. I have to
a few to watch). Am I the first to say that? I just noticed the reviews on IMDB are full of complaints that this film ends too quickly. I can't compare this to any other Amicu films except the others I review. Maybe I'l come to the conclusion this is the best one too. I just can say that I loved this movie. It contains everything what makes a good horror film for my taste. For the first half of my viewings the film was too slow for my taste, but the more I saw, it grew to be one of my favourites. I like ghost stories a lot, I love good hairdressers. This film is a great haircut film in many different ways. I saw some reviews saying there's no continuity in this. No? I didn'the see it, I just enjoyed this. I even was so shocked by the ending I cance my whole evening to write this review. First I don' t like horror, but I like good films. This is really good. So, I can' say I'm not surprised why this film got the Baft Film Institute Certificat of Merrit Award. I'll get it, too. In my view. What I can't understand is how this film got only 0,1 of the IMdb votes. I can't understand what other people are expecting. They don' t like what
; people can just uproot from their homes and move thousands of miles to a small town to have a normal life with no one to even ask. It'd be interesting as a story element, I suppose--but it can't possibly be possible that someone like this would have a normal life. He's a total freemont, for example. And it was bad that no character asked for his ID after he arrived. I's like if you lived in a town that wasn’ t in a state you were in, and came in a taxi to your new house you were moving into, no one would ever ask you for ID. The only reason why they didn'r is cause the movie. If someone were to start walking around and talking in a town where they didn'r live, people'd be calling 122 or the police. It'd probably be in the local newspaper. It was a bad concept from the beginning. Too many movies like these have no plot, and they just keep having random events and people keep being random. I just can't handle it after the 30th of such movie. I didn’'t even think I'd watch the movie, but somehow I did, so I'll rate it at 7, for at this time the rating system was only 0 - 5. I don’t think I'll watch another one like this. So yeah, rating
Germany's top spoof comedy and takes those ideas one step further. The comedy team "Lust auf Film," whose main members have made such famous TV formats in Germany as "Haus Doktor Larson" and "Love Me," is behind this movie in cooperation (and competition!) for the first time a comedy. Müllens film crew has to face their first film project of real proportions when an American production firm wants one of their moviemaking experts to be the production manager of a huge Hollywood block buster in the 6x9 meter studio of Müllens. And it couldn't be any more of filming. The shooting schedule coincides exactly on all important dates in Müllens calendar: his daughters weddings and his retirement. The director of Müellers is a German director for whom Mulle only produced films for TV before. Now it' s his time to show how it should actually work and how it should look like. It' ll be his first blockbusting hit for Hollywood. Of cause, he also has the opportunity here that he's always wished for. Finally the chance of being able of having sex with his girl-friday. But Müllens, as it is his life style, gets things into a mess, especially that he doesn´t realize that there' just might have been a mistake. Because after all, Müllens is just in front and behind that 6
my early TV-watcher days but I'm still looking to get my mitts on a DVD set (I only know of the one from Germany, which I'm sure is pretty shit quality). The story itself is based on a popular book series from England - a series that was so popular its TV adaptation was broadcast world wide. So why hasn't everybody heard about Secret Army then? Well, it was broadcast in 47 countries and in 19 different language so I guess you could say that it never really took off anywhere. Still, this series was the first one that I had my heart set in on, and if I saw it again I know I've be just as crazy and in love as I once was. That, or I might start to make sense and it might put me off. Whatever. If any readers have the series in English (or can point towards a reason for why this series was never on DVD) that I can pick up then you know where to find the little old lady. I think I can find a way. And if I'd like to find out more about Secret Army, click here for a little bit on the history of the series. It might be a good idea to check it out if you want a little more information. Or click over there anyway, there might be something interesting for you in here. It'll be fun to talk to everyone about this series. I'm sure you
about it, was that a lot of great bands were featured. Buzz Cason has a really beautiful voice on the song 'Heart's Desires' which is played on a piano, very much akin of Elvis. Then there is also a nice rendition of the song, 'Rockin' with her Heart' by Jimmy Lee Robinson. The film itself is a little cheasy in parts, as it tries to make a story out of nothing, but it was still a fairly entertain film to view. I enjoyed it but would probably like some other Elviss film just that little bit more! Still worth seeing. Buy the DVD and listen closely to the songs and artists playing. Its a good film if a bit cheasy in places, and the songs are worth the buy. WATCH for.... BAND..... 'THE TIMES' (which in fact was not there) BAND... THE KEN PATRIOT BUSINESS 'THE TIGERS', (which in fact there was not) But was 'The Cougars') (I think) The other Bands featured in here as well, which are... Buzz Castan The Mood's Band The Vagaries Band Jimmy Reeves I think that'a a whole bunch! See a lot more of the film here. Enjoy! http: //www26.videozy.com//0420643/5
porno flick – I am in no way referring to my mom and her friends. She does have a pretty kinky side. Anyway. I think a picture is in fact worth about ten thousand blog words, so let’ see if I can use the camera well and capture the essence of my stay here: First up, as soon I got here I saw a co-tutor from my TEFL school. She was having a coffee with this other guy and they had a little giggleshower of an experience for about fifteen minutes. You don‘ t see that in China every day. Actually, you don‘t see much of the day here. And secondly, to use an already overused phrase: you have to see it (the squalor) to believe it! I’m a bit of a hippy myself and I really do think we should all live in communitarian, peace lodge-style communes but really, how far can communal living go? What about a village of hippy communes within a village of communist communes. No really… This photo of a typical street is from the first day in Qiangshui Village. My street is slightly less dirty but there are no sidewalar or proper streets leading off or into the main road. The only way you can get to or from your frontdoor is on your (or other peope’s!) bike – a bikey shortcut through town –
are getting worse, so its like the plots are just stupid now, it’ll be a show that ends like the last season of Gossilngton Girls. Just like it. I hope someone can save Gosslington but I do not expect anyone can. And it makes sense that the writers of this do not have ideas for next seasons plot because they never had ideas anyway. I don like this but I have to say that if I ever meet the writers of the show, because I’m from the same college, they’ re going on a nice long trip. (Laughter) I’ve watched Glee and i don like this show now either. When I watched it for the first time it was good. But as time goes the show is becoming stupid, like it’s just a show that is there only to make fun of people who don listen to music. What a terrible idea for a tv show. The writers don seem like they have ideas, just like that other show. That will be going off air in 2 years. But Glees writers seem to have very good idea. I hope Glees writers read this. I hope Gle gets a great new show creator who has new, amazingly smart plot ideas. So, I do have a dream too. And that’ s my dream. If you guys want a good show, you may want to make it. I’ll help. (Laughter)
All that you are supposedly watching are Pacino and his wife and there is no real plot that drives the movie nor does it really help you to get to know him any deeper than you already do. Also, the endless talk about food does make me feel full because it is something that I don't care too much for. However despite all of this, it isn`t so terrible. I do have a likinge for Pacinos performance. He has been on an ups and down role on what roles to take and this is by far one that he should have taken more than twice over the past 10 years but I am glad if he wanted to do it. He did a great job and the scenes where his wife tells Pacino off are very interesting. There are some funny scenes in the movie and at some parts there is an attempt made to show Pacinos flaws and at times he does come off rather strange, but it isn`y anything to memorable. The main characters mother does a wonderful role and the other people in the movi are good support for Pacino. The movie could have been much more and it wasn" be the best movie. However it is quite an enjoyabl e movie if only for a couple of hours. Al Pacino does a great job and I have to say that I was quite suprise at his portrayl and performance which was the thing I enjoyed the most about the entire film. I don" think it
Kingpin and the trailer looked awesome with all of the wierd sound effects. The only thing I was concerned over was how the movie would end because in the trailers I saw the father get hit in a wheelchah and die but I didn' t no what was on top off the chair. I also thought maybe the boy was going to kill him but he just went to the hospital. I thought it would have a more dramatic or sad end. Maybe I'll see this movie again but until they make a sequal I don't think I'll watch this movie ever again because the ending isn' t enough for me. So my rating for it is 2 stars outa 4 stars. If you like comedies that have some very nice plot twists and a very funny plot then you' ll see what you get. If not, than don;t rent that movie unless you plan it in as your number 1 movie for that day of the month. If not in a fun kind way. If you do then see what you get and make the decision of whether to rent it again or to rent again. The movie is very good if it doesn? have a big plot and has a little plot twist to it. That? s how you can judge whether you are going to watch this movie. You may also not see what they do in this film but it's still better than watching other moviies. I
chick, and a good time!!!! If you like "Talleys Lodge," You can' have your own fun by going see this flick!!! I highly recommand "Rock of ages," to young teener or older movie fans!! I was not disappoint at all!!! Enjoin!!!! This will be a movie not so forgetable!!! "Raymond" 06/1759:44 PM 19609 I've got to say that at first, I was not too sure about Rock Of  Age. Rock of Ages may not have great acting, but that's okay because these guys aren ' t actors (the guys who play the hair metal stars). But when you take a look back from Rock 's beginning to now and think back to when it started, in the early seventie, music wasn ' t about the people singing, it about the instruments. And Rock is about the instruments as much of the singing, just not as the same. As Rock of Age shows off, all of the actors are good, especially Paul Giamatti who plays a sleaz bag record producer. I liked how this guides were different from the actors because they were the same actors which played The Rock and Roll Highschool Film, the director of the film. I thought that the guides were great in their roles. Rock 'n Roll may not have great acting, story and dialogues and it may be
ruin this, in their way, by killing him off, it would be a great movie. But they did ruin this, by killing off the man who gave us the pleasure. What? Is that a great film? It may well have been, were the man to end it with a flute of champagne in the garden, smiling with the knowledge he was a luck fellow, having written one of the great screenplays, and had the most wonderful time. We would remember the man as he would have wanted to. The man, you see, has no way to know the difference between what he has written and how it will ultimately turn him and us, into mere material. That is because material is all we are. What we do not know, but we will one day be revealed, as he himself, as a person, a being a soul, will be, is not just what the thing does (it can take any form) to the thing itself and ourselves. The thing does what we do. It is always us. And what we are to it, it knows better than we know it. It is not, as some might have you believe it. It is not the case of man against nature. Nature will not save you, nor let you down. But it will save itself. It will not be done to you. You will do it to yourself. And this can be a pain to realize. All the things that happen to you are your own
so we're off the mark from square one. Then there is Demon, another video that shares the title with the more famous version. And then Demonoid, which is also known by a very famous title, although its title is really a misleading description of what you'll get. They are all horror movies that have been released on video in recent weeks by T&L Entertainment, and they have something in them to entertain you. If they are anything like what I saw last month I will be very entertained. So far, they're not. They're as horrifying (in their own way) as video nasty movies, but they don’ t have quite as much in them to make you jump, or even to make you want any more in the video nasty line. I will review each of these movies separately but first I think I should give the details about this release. The first disc is entitled "Demon and Demon". Its content is "NIGHT OF…". "Demon" as I've mentioned is entitled Deminoid and has its own title. It is a film that has been released on video before so a little digging will help. This one has a lot of problems, mostly due to a lack of editing. The scenes have a lot of editing but don't seem to flow. The acting is terrible, especially by the guy who plays Dracula. It'

have been, like it needed more sill. If it can't be silly it better be something else. Like this movie I guess. It' not really silly, but the characters are definitely having a blase time. They seem to have been hired to work on a new version of King Solomans Misty of the West. It doesn'ts seems to be clear who've been paid who for where. I'm not 50% convinced that that isn'ts because the movie itself hasn'ts figured it all our yet. Like if there really is nothing in it they shouldnlt give us so much of it. But it's also that it'st got no focus in it. If you're going to be a zombie comedy you should at least be zombie. It'st got a lot going for it, but it also really does try to be too many different styles. Maybe that works out better if you've the time, which I do not. At this time and place I'ts a bit hard on the brains. I'll probably have to think about it more to see it. But it does at least have a pretty good soundtrack. I'ts really not a very bad sounding movie at all. It's one of these that I'll either need to get into or get out off quick. It'st not bad per sé, but if you can be fun
on this side without getting up. I wonder how the average Russian or East European watches a musical comedy without getting up or sleeping through the first half. In Moscow I went to a couple of musicals and both times I was bathed in sweat. One of my friends explained that this was because a show that is supposed to be funny has more of an obligation to be lively and excruciate people. I have heard that in England a musical is never as good as it is in Paris because in Paris the shows are shorter and they keep the funny parts in. I remember in Paris on one occasion in the theater I was supposed a musical to begin, and this little man in the balloon hat and red coat said, “And now, ladies, I have a little joeke! If the joke is good and we laugh, the play will be very funny and we will be very happy.” And he gave a little jig, hopping around on his toed and we laughed. He did a little jig and said, “I’ve got it.” And then he gave a funny little talk about someone who had a lot to do in the office. And you’ve never seen such an audience as I saw there. And this other man came on and he told a jokey little story about a boy who was so stupid that he thought a pencyl was called a lencil and he kept
These men who go back into darkness don' t have the luxury of being who you are because it is not safe. Above them all is the great spirit of darkness. A man named Sleepy who is one of the spirits has taken a likin' to me. I have been through the most horrific events but I know I can live again. I want a little town and a home there. But I want more then just a home and the town. I also have a very hard time trusting men. I feel like I gotta have a leap into the dark again. It's either trust and die or trust and take a chance. The choice is hard. I can't think straight I haven just to try to decide. I know there is more to the story then meets the EYE. So I put my trust up to the man in black. I can feel the wind blowing thru my fingers. I feel the cold in my bones. It takes all my might to not break down but still I do because of what I have been. I'm the light that has burn out and the dark that has never been lit. I feel like I' m in a circle. There is no beginning no beginning no end. I feel broken and I have no other choice but try to find a way to make sense of it. I feel all alone in the dark and I have no one to lean against but the one
our government and our society, so why not use that in the title. It also focus's some of her own personal life story as an undrground railroaer. She uses herself as a focal point, which makes sense when she talnks of being a target. This movie didn' know what the hell it wanted to show, so it was all kinds a randomness (including her story). It would've been much better to focus on her story or on the undergrouon, but the two never connected. It was too many characters (they were not fleshing out each other), too many sub-plot, it felt long and had way many random scenes that didn't add much to the movie (including the ones featuring Spike Jonze as Michael Moore). Moore was there to help the director, but i feel she got distacdct and ended making a pointless movie. Just watch Bowling for Columbina instead, it'd save you a lot of time. It'll be a much better experience.… Explained more…” (read on). The director is also in the movie. There is also a movie called Bowel Movies.

but not to the extent that one has come accustomed to in Altmannesques. Still, the characterization was sharp and real, and I found I enjoyed it better than I would have thought possible with this cast. The script was tight, even in its most fanciful moments. The story and direction made the most of the material. The acting was wonderful throughout. I'm just a tad surprised that it was directed by Altmans. I'll be watching it again. It's worth watching at all! It's just not a major Altmann (there aren" t any) and that'll do you fine if you expect that. - The film is worth watching for its acting and its direction, but not for its story. It'll keep your mind occupied. I'm glad to have come across this movie and will be glad if I find out there are other films by Altman that are this entertaining. In fact, I think I' ll try to see all his movies now, even if they'll never make this much of him any more! I' d like to know more. I'm in awe of him, I think. I don't see a lot mov... but, I've seen every one of the films of Altman. I can' think that anyone else, let alone a new director, could have done better in this direction. I' d love to see what he
I remember everything, and yet I hardly remember anything, and yet I do remember everything. I't' not only about me... It'ratherabout the movie itself, and how I saw It in the cinema, how it was projected, how the film was lit, how my neighbouds were sitting and watching me with amused or disgustring expressions, because I used sometimes to be carried off during the projection by my fears and by all my feelings, and I would sometimes begin shoutign, shaking my fist, scolding the actors in the movie... This movie is as frightening to watch as it is, 30 years ago, to read, it's the only movie I have such feelings about... The others have always been, for the time, or for those who saw It, very simple.. But when I see this movie, I always want the people sitting in row to move their heads, or their bodies, to get them to look at all the spaces around them, to show them all the shadows that move when the film is on ... I can understand someone saying they hate being with people while watching a movie, but this is only the movie, only the movie, and if the spectactors get screwed because the movie and the people are in conflict... they should just stay home. (...) And yes I am always waiting that someone will ask to see it again... I'n not telling anyone
middle and high- school and have seen it many times afterwards. It is a true tale of one little boy in Africa in 5th grade, who has a big dream that comes through by the end credits to give a great message and a tearjerking ending. I saw this movie again in the 10th anniversity of my cousin, who was born to ¾ Ethiopians, ½ Italian. I was born ½ Italian and ½ Irish and when the little Ethiopian lady said, 'You look so much more Italian!' I was so excited inside! I wanted someone to look at me say the same thing! It was at that moment that my cousin and i realized that we are much more mixed raceds then i could have known. I was the only one in my classroom and 2 classes before, and this movie just made that better. I was still very sad when the Ethiopians were dying! I just wanted to yell, ITS ONLY A FLICKS! You can' t tell me that you don" t have a dream! This movie is such an inspiring movie, the message is amazing, and the actors are great especially Abrahan. (Abrahams last name is Zimmer, which you will find in the movie, and also has a great performance). I highly reccomed seeing this movie in the movie theatre, and maybe having some tissue paper or w

constructive criticism! It has everything, including the kitchen sink, so there is NO room for moral comment. It is not the task, as some of the review'ers claim "to get inside" someone, but merely to present themselves to the audience "warts"and all, which they do. As a social comment, it is very important, because, although it seems to show human beastiness without any real reason, when you consider that these people are in the main poor, and that this society has had a lack mentally retarded person as a king for over 30 years, the film shows the absentees of our morality and decency. It is also a masterpiece of cinema, and I am delighted that it has won the 2 awards that have come to it's credit sofar, for direction, because the direction is perfect, every scene is a masterwork, and the acting from all of the cast, is exceptionally good, in every way you could hope for, and, in one or two cases beyond all hope. And as a final thought...I think that this film has to go down, as an important comment on morality, if not a "film classic" in the 2nd sense. It's not for anyone who is seeking a night's "entertianing", unless you'd like to enter the darker, filfthiest, and most deprave side
costumes, locations, light effects, and most of a all, the choreography. But after watching it a few times, the true power of it begins to emerge and, after many more, really comes into focus. There are scenes that could only be captured by cinema or theatre - not TV or stage - that show not only how much was thought out, staged and executed - in some cases involving large choreographic numbers with thousands on set -but how much love and artistry went behind the making it. It'll be interesting one day to learn everything that went into its making. The cast is a wonderful bunch of familiar faces. It's an envelopment of the sensual experience of theatre in film. It's almost like a stage play captured on film that, if there ever is a film version of Romeo + Julie (another stylised film by Luhrman), you'll know what to do with it to capture the essences of what it is like to be on Broadway or London's stage in front row, as I was for several years, or even be on-stage yourself for the thrill of a life time. Some shadows in the film may need to go to help the story progress, and a couple characters I could have done without. That being said, it will appeal greatly to many and even the restless will like it, given it is a very visual production that can be appreciated. 
voice. I didn't like that part. But I guess the movie was supposed to portrayed a very serious, sad and depressing movie about the Holocausto. Well guess again. The movie was a comedy which had a serious part. The movie was set on 3 camps in Nazi Germany and each camp had a different director. The three directors, Otto (Max Biala), Alfredo Fronzo (Sidney Poitel), and Roger (Peter Boyle) where all at the same dinner party and they all argued about the way their moviemaking was portraying, so what they came to a compromising decision that they should each make their own film and when the three films all came out, they would compare them. Alfredos film made him an Oscar in 11 minutes. Allegedly, there is a real movie called "The Big Bank" that is just 8 minutes and 20 seconds long. So I have a feeling that the other stuff they talked while they were in the kitchen was based of what some actors and real Jewish actors did at that times. One of the Jews was a producer that produced films on his own and he got 100, and the other one was Otto who was the "directed" who got to see the film made by Fronzo, and Fronzo was supposed to be a real director in Nazi German. So I think that was the reality of
be shown in its first ever 3D release. In case the title is unfamiliar to American readers: The Goonies never say die. It is 82mins long so a good time for a matinee. It is an adaptation by Eric Roth of Steven Spielburg’ Mikey Wallace novel – who also wrote the classic, Stand in the Rain (1960). A family favourite (2013), in the USA. This is not a spoiler but there are several death scenes in this movie so some parents may wish to review it first and determine its suitibility. We have watched this one in its original version at the cinema and we saw it just as recently on television. I found it was just as great! I was just over 11 when I first watched it – I can recall that very clearly. It is set in the 2nd world war in Oregon. The film is a great family adventure; it is a lot more than just children’s entertainment – it is the story of some ordinary American k11ds who go on a great journey. The film is quite complex and there are adults in it too and many references to things k21ldren may now miss, such as Starlite (the ark), Starlite the robot and the car – the Chittly Bitty. We are also introduced into a new world (for the children). What

fun at an advanced screening since Superman Returns. So if you've read some previous reviews of mine, I really don’ really “like” action flick. I find most of today’ action fights overwhelmed with CGI to the point that I can' t tell what's in front of me. I know many people disagrees with that, but that's the way it' s always works for me no matther how many people says I' am “unfair” or “unobjectivist”. Anyway it' s always feels good to me when a movie is fun like the original Blair Witch in 99′ is to me (which will be the subject of another review soon) and Red Eye is such a movie. Redearye doesn' get the credit it really deserved. It should have made a lot more money. I' ve to say I was imaqred by the quality of the script, it was just so great. I love the whole plot twists and the dialoge. I don't want give you any more info on plot though, it really a pleasure see everything unfold and discover what' s really going on (that' s the way it's always works with me). The one really negative thing I can say for this one is that you will feel sometimes that they are trying to cut every time the action is about too end. I found myself many a times
zany Beatlemania references. Here, we have a whole segment on the Beatlemania of the day. The Beat-Cruiser plays like the worst possible version you can even imagine; the music supersedes the rest. Ringo Stilwell and Brian Ep-STIN, two Beatlefans, take a bus ride to the Beatles concert and have a few encorelasses with some of the people on our the bus along with some crappy Beatles music. When these people do come back to the bus later in the movie, they look like they were just pulled off a movie lot. I don’t think I’d like to spend any more than a few minutes with these people. I think the point of this movie was to be an ironic satirish take on this Beatlemainia era of the late 70s in America. It just doesn’ t go very far or have any substanse to it. I just didn t like it at all. I wish I had spent my money some where better. Maybe the gas station. 3 stars/5 (a little high but not much) *** stars. I rented this when it was first out on VHs. I found it sooo goooood! The only bad thing in it would have to have been the sound quality. That really made you work to hear the movie, especially if you were sitting too close!

be that good. I was expecting it to me like a typical TV movie. But it really isn' t. There were times where my whole family got caught up into the show. I would like it be a min-series so I don get tired of the rountines or if they were just to slow. All and al, I liked the acting and the plot. I would reccomend this show if only you have time. Like me, you would be caught of guarded of what they are going to show you next or what was to come. Just give it a shot. You won't be dissponted. By: sis1012_12306315072151136 on 2/05/-20/05 09:56:30PM PDT from USA I was very impressed by the quality of the acting talent in this movie, and the fact the actors seemed to really care. I'll admit, the character of John Grissom was not really that likley, or the storyline, as much of it was pretty unlikley. This movie is just so much better to watch in DVD than in regular TV programming. By: bert810_12813044881510595053 on:02/12/13 02

was so slow. It was as if the movie wanted too much time for itself that a lot of things were skipped. For example- the reason the Jews were being perused is not even explained for a long time. And there was just too many irrelevant things in this film- people dying because of snake bite and the woman who was pregnant by her husband’s brother. I’d say this movie would interest people who do not understand the Bible as well as they can be bored in the long run. My advice is don’t waste money on it. Go for the other Christian films of the same genre. They are more interesting. I’ll give it 4 points outa 10 just for it’ll make a person think for once. You’d think that they were the only people who had this problem back then. I’m not giving it a 6 like other reviews since I don;’t think that’s fair. It wasn’ get a -1 cuz I don'’ really understand what is the worst movie ever, and I don’t think this is the worst movie that I have seen either. Just be warry when you see this film if you are not a christian. You will find your life being filled up with bible stuff and that’ll surely be a pain! If that was the message it was telling, it did a great job. I can tell you that I will
Worth seeing for the acting of the two lead characters. If it makes you sit back and wonder how you could be so easily fooe.d this will be a very satisfying experience at the cinema. I think it was worth the effort for that alone, but with the addition, that I never once thought the story was predictible, I was always wondering what was happening at the time, then looking at the film again, it was like wow ,did I notice this happening earlier. The cinematoghy was excellent, and the sound and lighting were excellent. A film worth the time and money, as it does make you think, what would I do in a situation were I caught out by a con-tricker. There is no right or wrong in what you do. I would say this is a film to make the most out of your trip to the pictures. A good night out !!!!. As a reminder, this movie has been rrated mature audince for good cause. A good film with excellent story line. I recomend this to you!!! 5 stars.... and a good job with it!!!!! Well Done. A good watch !!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It's a decent movie. Watchable and entertaining, but lack of the "funky factor". The chemistry is there, and the acting is pretty good, the characters are well fleshed out, and there is lots of plot twisting back
my opinion a poor way. There are lots, and lots, and Lots of close-ups on the protagonists, and while it would be fair to say that it shows how "deeply affected and hurt" the character is, it is just so unnatural and repetetive to see this happening so much, that I am not sure if it is intentional or just a failure to find a more naturalistic way of film-taking. For most of the time, I felt like I was seeing some sort a cheap, over-produced, over-acting reality TV-show... Not a good thing. The acting in the same manner, while not exactly bad is also unnatural, and sometimes very much over-excited... I mean, it is just not "normal". I am sorry to say, but it is just too much, and in the end, it becomes like a bad jokey film for teens, and it just makes me a bit sickened... This, I feel, is a major problem with the film, and it does make it feel like it was all just a little "bit" more than maybe it should be.. I also liked this film, but just thought it had some very obvious flaws.. There is however some beautiful "scenes". Some of the scenography makes it look like something straight from another time, and is also often really quite beautiful.. This is the film of a "gold-age
guards and they started to throw the ones they had got at them was classic. I was a teenager when I first watched it, and it has always been a favourite. It really had that authentic 1930s atmosphere, even down to how the guards walked. You can see Robert deNirons acting ability really shine throughout this movie, but in particular the scene when he first arrivs on the island. When I watch it now, it's always this part that sticks out in my mind. Great film. I recommend this movie to anyone. Defiantely a classic. I have to give it a 15/10. If you have never heard this movie recommended, what the hey, do yourself and others a big favour, and watch it. I guarantee that as long as you are interested, it has enough to keep the vieer interested right through to the tragidical ending where the old and tired gangstas are incarcered once and for a very long time, this time for good! Enjoy!!! By the same director, try "Heat" I highly reccommend that one too! Peace! LVL! (Living Video Library!) V2: 6/13/23 10/25: 5 V3: This one's in! ................ 7/27/07 6:20:
(the one filmpunk is a big fan on...) is a good example in making us see the story from a unique perspective. This is a good example in making us experience the effects in a real world and it'll do its best in giving us the grittiest feeling a real world experience can go. The film was an adaptation from a novel of its time. This film shows us an interesting part of time in America; an era of change and a time for the people of the time. It has its ups-and-downs but it will be a very decent film overall. This film is also based after the "D.U." series. In this one, we are given the idea of the story from a perspective of a "D.O.D." (or Death on Delivery). It's more than just a film about a man trying and figuring things out, it is a story about a person who is struggling, in a state of despiratio after he's been given a choice to live or die... And a choice to be one of them for the better good of all. This is what makes this movie great; the character is not someone you would expect it to be, just to be someone who's going from being someone of no importance and suddenly getting in the middle with the power of the world's greatest power. This is the reason why I call this film so cool; this is what is going to

this age. The costume also has the authentic details, such as some military decoration of shoulder boilers and other accessory. The hairdo has the same feeling as the period's time, and some people were also dressed up well and it gave the audience with the real feeling that it is the time in the middle of the World War II era. It was very pleasant. In addition to this, I would like to point some more good points and the bad points. From my point I would like you point out the following: The costumed actors gave the very good performance, however, sometimes the audience were disturbed or the actor was speaking but the stage was not clear of the audience. The other performance was that the audience can take pictures with other people or with the actors. They had very big masks that covered their face, and some actors had different costumize to be the German officer. The music also was very good for that time, and it gave to the audience a realistic performance. From this point of view, I could give a five stars to this performance. The other side I would say the following. My wife and me had a very bad impression for some actors that were speaking with foreign accent. When they spoke with accentes from Spain they had a very distorted accent that I could not understand what they was saying. Also, there was an actress that was talking a goss in English and she had different accent as my
you off at ten. She is superb as is the film as a whole. Just watch the last scene when she gets to talk...prices will go way up then......and stay in a movie.......for the viewer rating of 5.6 I suggest that it is a case of those who never saw the film and who are judged by some who have watched a clip and decided from that. Get them to watch it again. And a third times for any doubts. I just watched it again....and again......now I am going once again for those bits I might have skipped the first times around. I want to keep re watching this movie........and that is what it deserbs of!

Rhino in his role as a mob baddie however. As the story unfolding it made more sense (though still not much, and more unfortunatly still disappoints even mildly). At least I have a few more Viggo pictures now to watch to get me through! (And it's never good to see that your heroes can be asshats to those around you. I just hope you don;y think like this in real life V). And a few more scenes with Ben Kingsli as the bad cop. Overall I gave it a C+. Worth the price of admission on my way back from Copenaghin? YES! But not a film to stay up late for! :) Oh, did I mention there's NO SPOILERS here, it was so boring I can bareley remember the story, let along spoiling the ending! - KD. Read More >>...

don’t buy it. If it sounds like a bad idea to me (having a little fun and mockery in it, though) I don’t see it going to make a big hit out of it. If you are in the state I was, you will think about getting drunk at a bar than sitting by yourself, wasting your time. So, in conclusion, don’ t rent it or rent and just throw it on the TV and just leave. That'll save you 1.99 a day. (Mike Foss).

. I wish I had seen him live. I guess one day I’m lucky enough to see a show in person, I’d like to see him act on stage. He can act well but it just feels like it fits his larger than live stage presence. Anyway, Happy Endings is not too bad. My wife likes horses, so it must not seem too out of character. I would probably get it. I like the characters they choose, they both seem to like horses and that seems to be their common denominator. It just seems to work well. If for some reason you don’t have a copy of it, I recommend it. It seems to have a place in the hearts and heads of a great many people. If nothing for the great theme song. I always get a chub up thinking back to those years when we would get that song on a Sunday morning when I’m driving to a little town in Texas by way off route six outside the Rio Grande. It just feels like Sunday morning. Happy Endings has a special feeling. If it’ll take you back to that place and I have it.

previews, you think you are just going to get to see two people bicker, which is fine, but that was just a portion of the show. It turns more into a show that helps people live better lives. It's an entertainer and educational show at hea time and it'll teach you a trick of a trade, whether it be fixing something or finding something that is more helpful than the item they are currently purchases. I think the show is a good show and I want it back on TV if they could get it back on the network. To learn about the different shows that they are going to be showing. It a fun show if it'll be entertaining and I have to say that I do want to see this show. I think it' a good show to take a chance on because if you donate, you get some cool things from the shows past. This is the biggest problem of all the shows on the network. I'm not saying it's a good show cause I'm saying it'a bad show. I don't think the show' worth anything and I don't see what makes it more worth than the shows that are on TV. I wish I had better to say about The Big Problem. I's a fun show. There are a couple people who want this back on TV and I'm not saying I don's want it. If you're a fan of theirs and

So what I'm planning on do is give each of these Bad Films a short blurb. Just enough to get you to check it, because you just might enjoy a bad film as much, if not more then me, cause I LOVE bad cinema.

. The movie tells a story in a real way. There are moments of humor, suspence, and romence. The actors were great on screen as was the sound track. I would suggest this movie to anyone who lovs war movies. This movie shows the realities of war and what really happens. I love this type of movie because it shows what is real and what is not. I thought it was very interesting and I give it a grade as a war and romantis war movie. I've already told my family and friends about this film and I've told them to see it. I can't recommend this movie highly enought because it shows you the realities of war in a real way. 10 out of ten stars. If I ever get the chance to reel the soundtrack I will do it for this film because it's excellent. All the actors are excellent and they all deserve to be in this film. If your like me and like realisim and movies that are real, then you should go see this film because you won;':;'t regretit. I'm sure you will come out of this film with a different outlool on what war really looks and sounds. So get ready to go to this movie if you haven;'':'t already seen it. I'm sure this film is already a classic. Go and see it, you will not be disapoint
we would call “modest” budget. Not only do I think the script for the final scene sucks, but so does a lot else. But it’s not only the script. The acting sucks too, it must be said. The only person who does anything of merit is Jean-Louis Trintigneux. The rest don’think so? I disagreegreat. They look like they’ve woken from long haul night flighters from New York and have been on a bus for 36 hours. They look like they are not even trying to make the most out of a poor script. I think the biggest disappoint is the great Christopher Reevess’ performance. It’s so weak. He delivers his poor, poor lines with such lacklustre and unconvinced manner. What is going in this guy’s acting mind as this time? I can’t see it and neither could the others. I’m not saying this is the best script, but this cast could have done much much better than what they did for this film, had they tried. The storyline was also very predictible for me, but if you see it without knowing or thinking much of the script. This might just surprise you. I can’s see it. But, that’s the beauty thing I suppose about this movie it can be seen in any mould to appreciate it. The plot is also
the book, and that's ok. I can live, even if I can get a lot more out of the book than the film that will eventually come out next year. So don’t expect any raves about this film, but there are a lot of good things about this film, and I think it’ll be enjoyment for a lot movie fans. I hope the filmmakers continue with the adaptation of the series though, for as long as it last. I don’ have high hopes or anything, and this isn’ know when the next adaptation of the series is coming out… if ever. I mean, the gu……it’s Cratchon, and they haven’ adapt this one yet. Hope they continue, and make the last book, Timelin………I forgot what it was. Oh, and the book was pretty cool too. Not as cool as Congo, but still, the story was cool, so I hope that they take the time and continue the adaptation of Crichtons material…….unless they ruined the ending for any possible sequels? Don know……………….…….don know…..don…..don’ know…..don know…..don’ know……don know….don’ know. I just wanna see Congo: The Series. Dammit!!!! 4/4/22 Stars. (Above is my original review of the film.)

But that doesn't make up the rest, which is very b-grade. But it certainly is worth a rent.  <img width="25" height="20" src="https:... />I'm with u 4 that.

Smith), an in-house priest, begins to notice inmates getting “punctuation marks”. After the deaths of several prisoners, Sharpe’d begin a quest to investigate and get the prison shut down as it’d seem the “punishment inm” aren’s really over. A strange glowing white figure has appeared with each death – it’s a being from the “other-side”, a creature of sorts that’s been “sent” to “pardon those who were wrongfully condemned while trapped between life and the grave.” Sharp’ed begin to question if it might be him that needs the pendding more. “You’re the worst of all of them – you have lived a life in sin and you are not ready to enter into heaven.” Sharpes’d also have to deal with fellow in-house priests who seem not just on their mission, they’re also on some serious smack. Sharp also has to contiend on a corrupt prison guard that’s been murderin” his own prisoners for years and the in-cells’s been full, with no one notifying anyone outside, but everyone knows. It all concludes with a very clever, well-done surprise ending. “…a fine production from a company in their infancy.” – Video Times. Starring Lane SmiTh, John S. Davies, Mark Gom
surprise he's not as good looking and fun as I thought. I was expecting something from his wife Kristen Bell, but unfortunately I couldn´'t watch her. I found her too fat and ugly, and I couldn' t watch her. To be honest with all of you, I haven't seen any of her earlier movies, therefore I couldn´t say for certain if I found her attractive in them or she gained some weight in between. That's a pretty sad story, but I think that the two of them should stick to comedians. They are good at that. I've also seen some clipes about her new movie and she doesn' t impress here. I've watched "Knife in my back". I found it a hilarious movie. Maybe I found her hotter in it than in the other movie, not that I was checking. I don’ t think “Knifes in the body” is a good film and neither is "The Goods". I wouldn't recommend watching it for either of them. It may be funny, in some parts, but that it is. I’ve also seen “Kristen bell’ s birthday video” which I found funny even though she made me cringe. The reason is I know this girl. She’s my ex girl friend, the one who broke up to me and made a horrible video of me and
a "V," but soon realizes her own life'shistory and destinymay be changing drasticly. As a result, she begins writing her own history, which she sends to her friend. But the history soon begins to change on her and she is unsure if her friend, a boy at school she has a thing for named Jake (Jake Gyllanha), really exists, and if she should continue to "write herself into existence." The film is based on the novel of same, which was inspired by the death in the late 50’s of a boy who was walking home from school and died after being impassively crushed by a passing train under a set V sign on a stop sign that he did in fact make. The film was directed by James Franco, who also wrote, produced and co stars in it. Franco' s father, writer, novelist, poet Robert Franco, wrote the novel, which is set partly at the ficticious school of Shaker Heights High. James Franco plays the teacher Mr Burton, and it has also been revealed that the character named Jill Bolte Taylor, played by Sarah Jones is actually based on the real science professor by that name who had a stroke that was caught and filomed on a medical camera. The movie is set for release in December. Here is the teasre trailer: https: http://youtsu bee.be e/YhGQZ
something someone made on their PC in Pov-Rays. The characters have no movement and the acting is terrible. It's like this whole film was shot on the cheap. The lighting looks like garbage (like someone took a film shot with no lights and used a cheap lighting program to 'illustrate' the film, it looks terrible!). I have no doubt that a much better film could have made with this concept but this is just awful. There's just so god damn little substance in this that it's not even worth it to finish. It's just so bad. Not even for cheap laugh you could sit through. Not even for the bad acting, because they all look terribly uncomfy on screen like they hated eachother and didn't want the other around eachother. I'm shocked that they wernt murder at each other. I'll say this though. They had a good cast. If they put that cast into a much more talanted story. It would have worked and been a better movie than this one... This is a movie that I will never get back... I hope some fan of horror can give this movie more credit than i did, but it just didn' know how to make something cool with a lot... not even one point. Watch at own danger. Oh yeah, if a person made this film with a program and thought it would look cool, go to a
sex up everything with the word ‘boob’ in the title, that type of thing? That’s not how I’m going to approach the topic. No. I’m not that kind of man. I am a man of sensibilities. And I am going to use the ‘L’ Word to describe today what is my very favouritemusical score of the last ten years or more. It’d have to be, right??? I mean c’mon, it’s so hard for a musical to top this. Or at least that was the thought, I never really got around the the actual making of the movie. I know, I’m lazy. Don’ta lot of good that lends to me being a music critic, I know that already. But I am here to try my best. And if that is being an ‘idiot’, then so be it; at my age, I am not too worries about who likes it and or who hates me or what it means. I know how it makes the little girl in me sing and dance. And that's all that matters. And the little boob in you all just goes hoo hhhhh hhh hh hh h! Now you see what I did there?! *laughter in the audience and I give the finger* See, I can be like that too! I mean, I’d need to make you think for
something more important from it. So I’ma review it, too. You know, as a way for others (and myself) of getting the word out. I really think it’s worth it! And here’s the scream that I’ve been working so long on and have not been able share with you until now, for those who might appreciate the full 500 words version, or for those of who like to know more about what my children think and do while their Dad’s out of the house. (I promise this scary story will have more meaning. Just hang in there. I do not make a lot of these.) And I’m warning everybody that there’s an R-rating attached to this review. But don' t worry follks, there' s nothing bad (I promise, unless a few four letter words. But these are in the movie, not in this rreview) and even then it's not as bad as it could be. So on with it! Spoiler alerts. (This is just something to read if you have a lot of time on yur hands and nothing interesting to do with your day.) This story is a little long, but I'll do everything I know how to make my words easy to read and understand, I really do. It just takes a while sometimes. So buck up. Okay. Let’ say for some reason (I know it’s
it'sa 22nd century world that's almost indistinguishable to our own. A world that is a mix between '1999:Newport' from 'The Matrix'(only with less piss-takers), '2001:ASpace Odsssey'(a bit), 'Wall Street'(the money part, and the business), the end battle in 'Sleeping Beautey'(it even gets rehashed at one stage but is done very badly)and a good 100 million other films that use this tired formula. In between this it seems we're supposed ot hate the rich people and envy the poor because they don;t have computers! It was so obvious, i just hodn't the courage of my ignorace not to give this a watch. I am ashamed to admit that i have the same level of intellect as this flick! Oh how i pity my fellow mankind. It was so bad!! It's like a parody of a 'cyperpunk 2005' type flick in some ways. If that makes any sence at alI. I wish I'd left my brain with my conscience. They were both left at school and I've got no need for them now. Not like I have any use left of that either. It really was that bad. The best thing about that flik? It was about
trinity. The story takes place in India. It starts in a circus, and then moves to the village. This is where the gypsies go to take part in a holy festival every year during the month Ramdan, in which is prohibited to eat and drink. During the first half an Indian man finds a little orphen girl in his car'ditch. He brings her to his housewife and her sister, who are living in destitution on a field in his village'shardware. The second story is the following one: a gypsie girl who have lived all her childhood as a prisoner in a small hovel of the village, finds an escape to the life in the gypos'camp. The last story takes us to Paris. We follow the fate of a gypsie girl who left her country to go in search for a good life. But in Paris she found only misfortune. This last part of the movie is in a black-and white format. A real pity because the color is the main characteristic of the movie which gives it its soul. This part was very weak. A good film, not a great but a good! Enjoying it requires to pay more serious attention than what is often expected when watching French film with foreign actors talking in "fake" English. The movie's quality is very much dependent of the subtitler. This particular version'sdescriptive accuracy and fluid
