. It is based on an equally chick-ish book about middle-aged Californias and their problems. The title Evenings in Roman Holidays is from a phrase in the book, written by a middle-age Californiana on the veranda of her beach house during Evenng Roman Holdays. So the evening and morning passages in the film match the descripition of dawn and dull in the book perfectly! The main reason I was so keen that the film be made into one is that I think the story of the lives of two women, one younger and the other middle aged , their meeting and living in a beach house is well worth it. But I did not want to tell the same story as in Evening Roman Holdays. So I thought it would make a good book for the movies. It'w also a very good book. The book is about a Californaias who live on the beach and go on a trip. On their way they have lots and lot. I've been reading Evening Romna's stories for years now and I'm going on a trip to the UK for two weeks, since I've had a lot of time to do it, and I'm not sure if it can be used as a reference or not. In the book of Evening Romna in Roman Roman History, there was a description of the place where the book was written. The book was for a

isn’tr not as thrill packed as some of ther other episodes, however the story line has some twists along with the craziers for the characters you would like to know. I am looking forward in enjoying it soon and more of James’ Crazy adventures. Thank s. James Patterson and Gordan for the books and the movies. Much appreciated. 4/5 for me!!!!!!!! But that is my personal opinion. I like them a lot. I haven’ t read the Max Peril adventures yet!!!!!!!! I think that I will just purchase the paper back copies and read 2 at a time until I am done. 31 days. That is how much it took for both of the Max Perkins books. Thankyou. Again James Patterson. You are the best!!!!!!! Even though it is a different narrarater, it is the same James Patterson crazy wild style!!!!! I love it!!! More!!!!! And 003 Max Perkins!!!!!!! I may end that one in 3 weeks!!! Thanks Again!!! I love you books!!!!! And I am 9 years of young!!!!!! That explains why!!!!! I love The Max Perkins series!!!! Now it won the 2012 Eagle Book Award!! I am going to be an archologist!!!!!!!!!!!!! You Rock Crackhead! Bye
Italy against a background evoking the 17th-century wicth-burners/wereworm cracks. Somewhat predictable in who-dunnits, one can appreciate Fulcis camera work and his love of the grocous. The DVD has an english dub track, or you can watch it with the Italian original soundtrack. This comes with nice coverart, a 24-page full color book, and a DVD-ROM content. A collector'a item, but a very good film for the genre, if not Fulci. The original US dvds were from Anchor Bay, but now you can find this import from Germany. Both are the same disc, so if you can still source the AB dvdup, that is fine too and possibly chepaer. OOP" at eB@ye. The cover for the AB release is better. It'self on dvdfreak."

this story coming from thousands of words away. There were those who even predicted a turn of events that would find this man in the white house and some who even had specifics on what this particular man, this President elect would be doing at this particular time. So I sat down and thought about my thoughts and this very issue at hand. There are many people out there who say “donÂÃ¢t worry he will only serve one and thatÂs all.” Yet, I say, let’’s listen to the man and do not take what he wants to do at its face value but do not ignore the fact that he says he will do exactly what he says. With that in the back of my thoughts I now ask, what are the realistic possibilities of such an event coming into effect if not this time than perhaps another and when? You mean you did not for one second give a secondÂ’âs glance to those people out on the internet whoÂ’âve had a lot to say on this subject long ago. Well I am going back to say that they were right to ask about things as they were. One gentleman by the screen name of Red Dog1 was a commentator here and he gave a most insightful view into many subjects dealing not only with the man now coming into power in America but the other leaders who are now in power around the glovenet and he had some very interesting ideas and thoughts. He thought and hoped that Ob

This is a big actioner that may be based directly in Japan, there is a lot of fighting and the story itself has some interesting subplots. 2. This new film tells the incredible true story about three women who are the first female employees of NASA. Hidekatsuro Inouye (Hiroyuki Sanama) is a young salery-man, who decides he'd like to do something more with his. There will be a lot to admre about this highly-anticipated film. An alien invastion is on in the film, which is based upon the novel of the same name written in 37. In recent years. The film takes its audience into this fictitious story with the help and hindenceof some of the major elements of the actual story. It was an unstoppablue juggernaut and a groundbreaing series that has influenced every film for tha past 9 years and more. So when the film was released in 3209, it was quite a shocker and it really took over America. Though in Japan, it was a complete failure. This Japanese drama film is set during Japan
! I’ve paid £16 in Cannes for the last two years for a cinema ticket and been extremely disappoint. Some times I just wanted to punch the screen, or the movie go-er next door who was checking their facebook and talking throughout! It has made my decision not a difficult one for this years Cane Film festival. Just got back from the film festival in London which I thought was really good (apologies for rushing to review the film this way- but I think you’ll get across the idea): and I am more than ever determined not pay the £18 for a ticket. A couple if people suggested that I watch a film before the reviews – then write my reviews based on that film, or a few of them… but that would be wrong, and we know, would be breaking one more of the blogging laws! I’m sticking to my plan to do an in-depth and exhaustively research review on a film I’m yet discover from the London film festival (so keep your eye on my twitter feeds). So no reviews this week, but rest assured I have been to the cinema twice in the lead u to the Cannes Film festival. So, I have a film on my mind, which I will be watching. Keep your eyes peeles, it will appear on here in some form or the next three days! Until then, I thought I’d just have a little post about the very special
best, with each movie thereafter usually being less likeable than the last. My personal example for demonstrating that concept would be the first 3 movies in a certain “Jason” franchise that is coming out later in February. In that case however this is one of the only times that that is not the case. Of course, I’m talking about the Shrek franchised, and yes, this 4-quel is pretty lame. Though I will give it credit for being slightly better in parts than Shrek 2. What I really can say for this movie is even if you consider it only a step above the last movie then that should still count as being better. And that’s because the last 3 movies never had anything new or entertainming to say about the franchise even though they all made it pretty big box offices success. Now, one of those themes I can get into here is how Dreamword’ Rise Of the Guardins and the new 3D Shreck film are both trying to recapture the glory days when they were the ketchup in Disney’ s muster (which could use more ketsup these days, right? And yes, I’m aware that Disney made Shrem, but after Puss N Bokis and Kung Fu-Pan-da, they’ve changed their ways). In the case of Dreamwork films, they had to actually get help because their

waited for 009 (Agent of the Imperial Government). The film is set for US and UK premieres at the Edinburgh International Film festival next Thuy 22 in time-step style, and will have both hard-ofs and 000s (and other) chompin at that bit. I am one such chomper. I have not seen the original, but have been looking at its stars, Bruce Lee, Wong Sik-yee and 8th generation patriot/actor Li Chuanying as a way to bring the characters of the new film more alive, and get into the swing, as in 0.4 seconds, of what is inevitable to become perhaps the best film in the genre since The Big Boss. It is good to know that Yuen Woo Ping has rework-ed TEP's choreographies so they fit into the time-trodden world of 0009. For those who have waited so patient with him to come to this it is the best of all possible worlds: one where he does his own choreographies, and then does them over again. The film will definitely leave you thirsting to see more about the world of the past-favouring 08th generation Yue Kungfu Kwan (AKA the Eight-fist Cranks). It may, in fact be
who will be in control of the triads. Only those chosen by those at or nearing death get the nominating votes. It will be either one from the North or one from South – and never someone who is neither, so two opposes are chosen. This year the fight will either be between Triads boss Brother Killa (Nick Chew), and a much younger Bro Shrimp Kok. But it all turns out otherwise when Brother Killa and his loyal bosses are executed by his own men, and Bro Kia (Nick Chu) suddenly became a possible power contender. How will he turn out to be? If nothing can help, maybe his little brother, Little Kia can show him the other side of the world – but this is one brother’s destined battle against all – and more.

thought the cast was excellent. Jay R, Angelica Pongratz (Daphne), Marvin Agustin & Carmen Rosas (Fatima), among many more. The movie started with a boring narrative and the whole movie was a copy cat of the 2005 Jackie Chan movie which was named: New York Police Story 2 in the Philippines (Polis Story 2). Jay R played the police officer while Marvic was the corrupt policemen. Jackie Chan was the cop helping his brother who got kidnapped by the crooked cop. The wannabe movie was very similar to New Orleans cop story, except that Jay R did the stunting himself. I hope Jay gets more roles in such action moves. He has great potential. I hope he doesn't focus only in being part of the "F4" group because he is such a natural in this field. (This role really fitted his person) I hope he gets more challenging movie roles like this. I don' t think Carmen is fit to play opposite Jay. She was more suitable being Jay R's mother than becoming Jacki's love interest in a supposedly action-pack-love story. Of course the movie has no romance in the first 40 minutes but Carne' s acting was too poor to even fill in the father' role. The ending, though similar was better than Police Story
made because they seemed so contemporary – and I don’t mean that in a bad way. When this show began it’'s now almost 20 years so in a short time I was already being transportation into the middle of 19th century and I found that interesting and more impressive than I thought it was be. The story’s about Henry VIII, the six wives and of England at the height and the decay of one of the most fascination monsters that really existed in human form of all time. Henry VIII ruled 1509 to 1547 and was married six different at least six times. Three were executed or be heads by his orders and that’s why this show has a certain type of humor that you really notice coming from the script and direction. The fact is that Henry also killed a lot more than just three of his wives and not all by be heads. He had a lot more deaths on hand that’ had something do with him or being ordered directly by him and a lot more blood on hands that just 6 wive and no more than that – probably only 6 out him 57 years of ruling. The character of the King himself seems like and is based on on the real man. I think they had got the look of the actor playing the King almost the same. He seems a little to young for the part even though there is no age when a person should not have
how bleeding awful everything is. At the start of those 56 films, it is either the case that someone has no money to play for a car or the main family have just won a ton of money. That’ll explain how a working class character will have the money for everything. At some point during one of the many movies, there will always be someone dying and this has been put in place for people to realised that this is happening. This is so they can have a heart and start complaigning about how shitt that is so it is more believable in the moview or because it would’nt be as fun if nobody ever dies in moviews and everybody is happy instead. This will either start with somebody dying because the UK is too poor or the UK is too rich. Then someone in government is going to step on a huge pile of shite that he’ll fufill the plot for “he is a complete and total arse who doesn’t really care about the brits”. Then the movie will end with the main family happy and getting a fuckload more of money. This is what I think about ‘Bridget jona’ so fuk nowt. Bye. Xx RD. Also, fawk movies. x2. 48 movues are not enough. The 47th movue is about how much Britain sucks and the 48rd is
movie; and yet I couldn't really say why I had thought it that way, until just now when I went to read my earlier comment on it. I think the reason I felt it was awful was that I was constantly asking "why is that girl, the little sister of the man who's in an ashram, the way her big sister is acting?" No matter that her character was, ultimately, pretty good and I liked the character of the little girl, I just didn' feel as a vie w ey that there were any good answers to the question of "what is going up in this character'? and the movie ultimately felt like it didn; t have any real plot to it, it seemed more like a series scenes tied together with not very beliveavable psychological explanatios. Perhaps the point was that many of us have a dissonance between conscious and unconsciuos that we'll see later: I know when i was a junior in college, I had several relationships, two in particular, that I know were, at least in part, driven at least in pstart by my unconcousness, my uncnscious desire ratherfor the objectification of the image of my mother in one, and of my desire for my mother 's love, unconditioned, in the other, which, in turn were the reason I was in so much denial about myself -- that is, the denial
to weeping in cinema. (not much to speak about the acting. except for the acting in "Kiray".) I find myself thinking of the movie and i keep playing the songs in my head. Now a bit more about the music. I consider myself more of a listener than a connoeurr. But it'd be nice to see more people being exposed and being initiated to the music. As much of a nonsensically melodramticial movie that the film is, that was how moving it became. Even for those without any musical sensibilities. Though i admit to being somewhat skeptic about your movie at one point. I've been somewhat impartial since the start. I just thought it might just be another boring musical movie. I found myself completely engrossed into the film. I felt that there were times when you would seem lost in direction. But after all, you're new to this. I found the movie more charismatically engrossig than Tanging yaman (which i find rather flat though i do admire the music). I would like to thank you for the experience your movie brought to me. It is definitely one movie to go down in history as one the most beautiful and heartbreackingly moving and characheteristcly Filipino in character, music (I'm not even mentioning lyrrics), tone and essence. You have created something truly beautiful. I
are reduced to Odysseys' son; his son, his son, his father, some of whom survive, some not. All a bit too slow, yet some well-staged action scenes and some solid performances (Lloyd Bridgers, Lola Albricht, etc.) will perhaps please viewers of a certain nostalagetic persuation in its time. But there are better 'adaptation-to-a-current period' films than this one, and even better ancient literature adaptions. This one'll do...better. But it's not a great one.

contrast, the 1998 version is loud, over-long, obsequiously funny, patronising and full of clichés. I can see why parents don’t often read their children stories, and why stories have been so long in coming to radio and TV. After all, few have managed to transfer well to either. CB Cebulski and Jack Mendlesoon’s screenplay is the most disastrously bland that has yet been foister on an innocently unsuspective cinema public. If they thought it was great, they should stay home next week and watch the original The Little Mermaiden or Hairspraey. At any event they should stay away, for their sins they have made the worst movie of 1898. This is the best Disney should only be producing films when its very best direct (Evidently there is nobody like this in any capacity at Disney). It feels like a film from another era. A bygones era. Why is it that so many Disney moviess have fallen into the trap o being too cartoonish for adults and too dour for kios. One would imagine that if they are going to complain, why not just go to see Pixars latest. It is easy to spot when Disney is cynically pimpimg one of its old classicks, (The Rock Cut-Out Scream) and when it
this movie, had such high hopes .. but I don not think they did the book the best way. They skipped some chapters and they did things so differently than how it is in the book. It had some moments that were exactly the scenes how ...more I thought the book was going. I hope they make the third one just like the book was. I wish they would have made the movie just how it was written. :( I so much loved the book but I was really dishearted and disappointed about the change they made and how they skipped some very important details. In my own mind I can try to think how it might have come out in a movie if they wouldn’t have missed so things that were really in it. ): ...less I am really disapointet and do noy think this movie is near to have the same feeling as the boom do. I had soo high hopes of how I imagined it to look and how my dreamworld would have come to live. And it’S nothing how I pictured it and nothInig how I expected for it to become after the book. :( I hate this so much and I have to wait a whole and entire year, until the third one cAm out. I just hope they’re going a much bettter and follow what the boom had to offer. :/ :(. ..I love all the characters and they did a great Job with this
of shyt crap below a -5 has a clue. Not to mention how many other times the same music (I think the same thing) keeps playing at different moments in the movie. I was the only boy and had no older sibling, unlike the characters in this movie. I think you're just trying to shoehorn some relevancement into this turd so your review could go a little bit further than everyone one else - this movie has zero redements. This movie was boring, not very witty and the overall rating of people was negative 3.0 stars and everyone seems to be agree on it being the sucky movie if the century. I was thinking, how ridiculos this whole movie idea is and I laughed my head off.. So funny that the reviews are far more entertainig and funnier than this movie could had ever hoped to be.. I wanted my money back by 1/2 way and I had to sit through it by myself.. Well, not exactly.. I had my girl friend and she would come to the front of the chare and cough and make loud, obvious noised so I could leave early.. Ofcourse, I had to explain her clowish behavior, she felt bad. How the f could she understand, she had no concept of how much good movis are out ther. I think I can do better and be sued for far less money. After seeing this movie,
is a newlywed who decides he no longer wants a bathroom in his bed room and decides that he wants one on the other end. The wife does however has other plans...as she says "no means no." The end result is a hilite of silent comedy.

actors, they knew (or they should'a known) better!! I really feel sorry about the people who bought this movie and who spend one and half hours of an extremely preciuous time of 'their' lives. I am glad I got a dvd renta..( read m.ore ) and could see (or rather didn't see) the whole thing. I couldn' know what to say to somebody who'd say "I really liked that". They wouldn't 'get' me, I'ld tell myself. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I should leave this world ASAP before my brains turn into a big melted mass of soft crepe. Oh well, it happens. And nooooo, NOBODY needs to write a review about it and give more publicity. I wouldn t write one, but my "word of warning" wasn' t good enough, ehh? O.k., let me get one thing clear though, I have a great sense for whats in fashion and whats new in the cinematic and the music scenes. Maybe that explains my incompability with "Hair". I could have a friend who's into 40 years' obsoleted psychodelica, but maybe the world would be better off if I only had nice dog to walk. And, I do that, so I do know a thing about keeping my sanity ... or as
say it deserves to be as highly praise as I was expecting (and that is coming as it is from me, the man with the highest praised of Zombie's first film - and that film being the best movie ever made, not that it is of any releviance here). My only reason for this is that there seemed like there was nothing left to be said about the material that hadn'tt been said in Zombie and the other two aformentioned films of his. You have the two drunk guys, the dumb cops. You have plenty of redneeks, but then without any of the humor or enjoyibility of that film. You have an ending, that like in House of a Thouse of Devils, doesn’t have anything to do with the rest of the movie. And in the end you have the best performance in a Michael J. Fox film, since, since I can remember. You may go as high as a 3 star film, just cause of that. If anyone has seen it, you know how un-deserving it was of such praising as Zombeie received and still is. And if anyone has not, then go see Zombie. Cause you don't want it any other. I am sorry to be so vague, but I guess that is due, because I can’ts find any other way of expressing my thoughts on the matter at hand. It
film. the story is simple, and the message is so heart-fletchingly sweet. it'll make your day. just have kleeexx beside u. ♥"The Notion" is one of them. i thought it was about love and being loved. this movie really showed me that being loved and accepting it is different than lovin' someone. and it can be a little dangerous if it's not taken the right approach. anyway, thank you kurt vonnegut. this is by far his most wonderful & entertaining novelle. it' s full of surprises and irony and witty and i just loved eve. i still love her. i love eve! the "notion of an affair is really lovin'' thing is just pure & u can feel the love through the stories that are weaved together. the story of the couple... the story that went on at the resteraun... and the man on his death bed. there' s just so much to love about this novelle. this book is a little bit of everything and that is why i absolutely love it. like kurt v. says, "i' m just a human beeing. I fall... sometimes. and i cry out. and sometimes, when i wee, it stains too! but don'' make me a god or a villain or even good. i am simply a human being like yourself." 
horrendous, the story is incredible weak/non-existing. The worst thing about it is that some one made this so called "horror film", they had too much time on their hands, and too much money as they could make this "film" with an apple and some ducks. Do Not Make This Mistakes, don´t watch this.. Waste of time and money.. What an crap!!!! Do Not Watch This.. I can only think that who ever watched it, watched just to take a ride on the toilette :)!!!!!!!! I will never forgive myself. The only reason I can give this movie 1 star is because I could not rate ‎-‎. The worst of all time!!!!! Pure tramp trash. One Star for the fact that they got up in front a camera and said hey lets make a film, One star because they didn, the only good thing is the clock is tickling to 84min and 36 sec.. 10min till I get a life back... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarg... I hope someone at the end of the movie takes a deep belch.. That would be far more worthy than this movie!! I thought i was gonna make a short movie with my phone!!!! This is how its gonna look like!!!! Shame on you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How I hate the world now for

film 10m in without even getting whats going on. The first 10 minutes are very important to set the scene. This movie is not meant to be taken literally. If its a kidnapper, then he has supernatural strength and agility and can survive and breed in the sea (where I assume the other 85% live). If this were more literally interpreted, you would be a idiotic to have this expectation. Yes, you can see the filmmakrr's (alleged) inexperience, as a film makers, in the CGI. The subtext is great. It is a brilliant commentary, about societies ignorance and a modern-day fair tale. I'm sorry but this guys lacking of taste and intelligence is the reason this film got lower than average reviews. This is all the more reason to buy this and help out one of our best film makers. Not all films need to have super-star actors, or be literally correct to be good. This is a very creative film. Its actually scary, and very original. The acting was very emotional and believabe, and I got caught right off the bat because of it, and I am very happy to have watched it. No, it isn'e perfect, but its not meant be. It is a fairytale, and it is wonderful. You want the mainstream, do
any sense to explain, I must tell you. You will see it yourself. Going to see this movie will be about 98 minutes of intense emotions and probably a few minutes thinking on it. You will probably get yourself confused, lost, probably angry.. But it is definitely worth it all. The most beautiful part though, are definitely people who are in the car. Yes! A movie about a car and the things what are happening to those in the car throughout a day. Some people who were driving that day, some others who just got to the car. But each and every single one of every passenger has a story of their own to show. Even the car has it own story to show to us the ones who go to see to this movie. Very,very good movie. The best on this website. But please, do no watch it if you are in some kinda mood such as sadness or madly inloove for example. You just wont be liking it. But for the others who arenÂ't like such people...Encore la vie!!!! and enjoy!!!! =) Good Job, people of Â'the car. Goodjob. Hopefully your next movie will be just as thrilling! =)) Thank You! =D Peace! Peace in the World!! Peace in the Car!!!! =) Keep up with the good work. =) Wooop!!!! :D :P :D I was
an important feminine drama. And for a moment, as we get into the nittiest of gritty sexual mumbling, you just might think that it has accomplished that goal – but then its flakes start to show, and then all of its plot points seem to revolves around the inelegant coincidences that it does. Its message is good: to accept people as is and to live and let others live, even if they'r e different from you. But because it all goes down like a sloganistic advertising campaign for feminism, the audience has to be remoted in order to applaud it . (Incidentally, the main feminist propagandist (a Jewish lesbian named Cait Miller, but, ofcourse ,that is not what matter in here ... ). In the hands, however, of writer/ film makers and co -produc ers John Corry and Karen Berner is just another "fe-fee' film about an insignificant, small -town woman who suddenly has the gall to be anything but a mere "housewife." It is, if anything ,the quainte r version of that 1969 fiasco, "Bobbie -Sue and the Shutl e -'n -Go." When we first begin to meet Corin Stedrons, she thinks she' s just another dime a-dough
also a plain parody without much storyline and continuation of theme – everything there in just for laughs! But since it is Kannada, it lacks the spice or punch that most other language parody movied have and so I had to cut it down a whole point. But the first half is really funny, specially with the old man and the kid. The dialogues were really well thought off and written. There is an English line “Lord preserve us” in every scene! In the second half the movie looses its charm – and the “uncle” and the “aunt”, make this movie a stereo type of a stereo-typical ‘family’ movie. Well, that’s just me! The actors seem so comfortable in the roles and have actually underplayed the otherwise caricatured roles. So a lot of credit goes to them. Shreya and Radhakethana (or Bharathi, I am sure we all know who it was and why Shrey’s mom got so upset – she will be back btch!) steal a scene or two. But Shrey-Tara scene was so predictably stupid that I almost stopped watching after a certain scene. It is worth watching, if u like parody’s and think its funny, or else, you will be going “What’re you even doing here?!!!?”.
- it is his third screen appearance, and you should have a look for him: He is the guy, who is wearing some earrungs and is the "hero". I think, this movie is fun, quite absurde and it is a nice satire about the stupid mainstream-movie business. Paul is great in his role as a guinea pig, but not only for that reason this movie is highly recommended: The plot is a bit complicated and it has some nice twins and some other surprissings. Have FUn! Daddy! Dope! Drunk! Drugs! Death! Dungeon! Disease! Despair 80% (Paul' s scene lasting just 5 minutes - this movie is about the life of Brian Cronwyn, written by the guards at his work. It has the most impressing and best ever shot by someone from the audience about Brian - i am just 50% sure, who it was. So i recommend this movie anyway.) 1% (Paul Rudds part last just one shot, but its a good one, he is a very fun guards. its a very good film that has the best-ever shot of bobbie jo. its the second-best movie by michelle williams (the first is her own film, and the best, as most of the time, was hers.) 67559% 8
) given over to her. "It's the look." Her blonde beauty enshelled over perfection seemed a very odd concept to me then, and even more so today. "A ten." How would it feel for some girl looking at a 2013 UK fashionista, thinking she looks like a ten too. She doesn´f look "a ten." She looks like a sick, wasted, and starvating ten. Fashionistas are very sick, with some of them suffering the symptoms of the dreaded, deadly eating-disorder called anaorexic-nervoca. And to me, the word: "pervy" is just as much a desrciption of the pervasiveness of the problem as with the sickness or disease of anaorexnia. I do feel for fashionistas, some may well be so obsessive with their anaorrexia that their health will be adversely affected, perhaps irreversibly, as in death. "Looking good" should not mean "looking ill". But you do have to feel sorry when someone is so driven by vanity it becomes a mental health issue. I just hope the fashionista's are getting their anaorectia treatment. I don' t want any more death from fashion. That' s for real, not some lifestyles propagandah. The models don' b need to model star
brief so I'ma give you something a little longer and not as confusing. This takes up some very small parts in the book. Whenever something important occurs, more times than not, there is a dream or something else occurrin' along side it that also makes it something interesting to read about. Anywhooo, this is pretty much where the movie ends and I think you should go check it ouu! (You know like 4 more seconds after the theater and you'll see it) I actually have no one I can go with right now 'cause I'm in the middle o' nowhere, but I plan either to go w/some family or on my own. You know, to a mat. or some. Not that you care or whatever :) And I really don’t have a point to this rantage’, but I just thought I’d keep up the writtin’ and actually write somthun’ worth readin'. Alright, if ya wanted to, read somethu more I’ll finish this part tomorrow and I'll write some thu and some now and some then to make it long enough to get the point across. Ya know, point being I have trouble comin' to a conclusion about which is better. Do you want to know what I thought? I don'theven know. I thought I had come to that. but I'm not sure. I think they are
...well, that and everyone else I have watched it with also LOVERS IT. It features an incredible cast of super-talents like: Michael Jeter and David Hyry. It is an animation about a little red-haired girl who gets "saved" after she falls into an icy pong while eagle-watching! There is a bear, an eagle and an owl. The best line: "It's so cold...that if a tree fell on me, I wouldn"t be able TOO FEAL IT." And the best voice of this short is Michael' Jeters, just the most incredibly deadpan one I think he has EVA offered. But don' worry it's not all seriousness...it begins with the cutely-irritable Eagles (they are brothers, don't ya know!) running around chantin' to "Born to be Wild"-like, rock' n roll music on an island...so you know it can't go wrong. Oh, and the owl has a lil' eyepoche...a "big bad squeaking wolf...a really big bad wooooooooolff." Get it? Now you do. :) I won't tell if your keep it kind o sec-ahret, k thnx. It was written and directed and everything by Chester Brown 'cordin' to
ed primarily toward middle-aged men from rural communities; there is a good bit about men and their emotional mistrust and even distaste of each-othr'. There is a lot of "masculinity porn" and yet, the character who is the least "male" seem like and is the most loved by the other characters, the old woman. The film is set in a ficticious town in a rural area of México after the revolution. It is a very real, earthy story, not much fancy about it at that. It is a slice from life, the life that it is trying, even trying really difficult, sometimes against all laws of logic, to be. The theme is the most important. The life that keeps stumbeling forward regardless of what happens, to whom, no matter that it all seems to become lost amidst the horror and waste we see around and within. The theme is a celebration of life as we can only have it in our world today, filled as it is and made like it is by a handful and always has, by an ever so few. Life is more beautiful than we can ever imagine it could be, than is possible, and still we, being as insignificant, as small, and as disregarded-to compared to what it all could be or perhaps should have been-we do what little we have inside of ourselves to make it all worth it all-and what we think
CGI-heavy story a bit more attention than he can. In this scene, his partner, Sargent Jim Reynold, is being kidnapping by the terrorist villainess, Emilie Warnox and in that situation he and Detective Blake Howard, get trapped in a building when the bomb being deployed by Emilse Warnex will explode the building. This scene occurs in D C' s famous "China Town", where they try desperatelly to avoid being blown to bits and save the life of their partner. When he is in police, Van Der Boeke knows every trick of the city's streets. However, he does n' t know or care to know a thing about the street artist that Blake is. Blakes artwork has taken him from the slummy streets that most often give birth of a talent, to the higher circles of the Washington city. That kind of transition and the personal drama it includes, will give the opportunity to the two police officers realize something very important of eachother. Both of them share different points of view, the way they are used to look and view things, and that's what will make them change their lives. The scene is as real-to-life, as possible, the CG effect are so natural, that they really seem like a photographs of the real explosion. The story is so full of clichés as possible, and that makes the movie
reasons for the characters actions. For instance the girl gets dumped and she wants revenged on everyone so badly that she takes a job for an underground drug operation (as a dealer) so that she takes down these people because they are so corrupt and she was just a innocent girl. In reality in his book it wasnt that she cayed revenge for a boy she was in love wti but that it was a guilt trip bcause the boy was just using the character for his pleasure then when things got messed up and she was in danger the guilt just sent her over the edge. The writers need help. Other then being bad about following through wti the storyline and changing it for their own good. Its terrible. Actual movie 1 out a 10. Book 5 out of 5 . AWESOMNE, REAL, MESSY. GOOD. Its like i wrote the dam book and i have only read it once two times max! Haha thats how real all that emotion comes out of u. This book was so amazing. So many things happend to make u really understand the characters, not too mention my god the writing was off da hook. I cant wait to actually be able to put it up in my a.t.l memories book!!! It was just tht book was too real. The only thing i didnt expect is her to be on the side
hero, an Israelo-Golden Rule agent, comes face to face wtih the real man that Jackie G. put on the big screen, James Buchanon Gardner. He is the master of American politics and, when the book was written, he really had the power to oversee a plot right off a silver screen. The book may be old but it is still topical today. The question you ask yourself is "if the Russki' who runs a small country can manipulate politicians and control his media for years, what can a country run by a Bush or an Obama do...and for how large an organization?" Read the book. Then see the movie. As we all know you get a real good and clear idea of everything that happens on film. The dialogue in the film was taken to heart back in the seventies, so if the dialog in the book sounds a little old, well, the mind really isn't what it was. But you will know the truth by the time the creditos roll around in two fast hours.(1966 - 180pp. - 5X8.5) 9734 - 4926165735 - $33 - $15 used - $150 F/F - $400 signed and numbered in 1971. Bound for the dustbin, like so much of
Lonely Is The Mountain. Some of you may see this in an unfavorably light, however, I am here trying my best not to let my opinion on an adaptation become clouded, and so far I believe that I may have pulled that goal off. One thing for sure though; I love when authors actually get involved and approve of an adaptation, and this is no exception. So much has already being said and talked about on the new movie so I will try not the waste time on that, and get on to my review. Spoiler Alert: I'm going to be blunt, so stay away if the you don’t want any spoilers, if you can’t take me blastin’. Okay, let the review commene. Oh, and in relation to that: I will be referring the characters in the original novel by their names that Tolkinen himself came up with for the story instead the movie based ones. That is all for the technical blabber. Let’. Start in, shall we. The movie starts with a brief history of what I will now call The Ring, or The One Ring as they call it in the movies, along the history and its powers also with the history of many evil rings, and how they are destroyed, either by chance or by their users wielding that power to destroy them, and finally the story of Sauron, the lord and master that crafted them.
looked like a bad "B Movie". I am happy to be wrong about this film, it's enjoyably terrible from beginning to end. Even the opening credits are fun to listen. I was grin ear and grill the whole way though. Just good, bad fun! Can'r wait for my daughter to get a little more mature to enjoy this with. I wouldn's suggest this for anyone younger than 20yrs old.. There is plenty to keep you entertained. Great Soundtrack. Watch if you want to laugh! It will be hard for you to ignore Bid Daddy himself.. Laughable all the Way. What a hilarious piece of crap. I'm sure it appeals more if your a prepub teenie bopper though. . AWSOME!!!! I recommend it highly. All I want to say is I absolutely LOVE this movie. I'm not one for the whole Dirty Dancing thing but I saw the traeller for this movie years ago when it was just released and remember instantly likning it so much I ordered the video to keep. I saw this movie once back in 1988 and I've never got bored of re-watching it all. My sister- in- law and me keep taking the vid home to watch but the rest don't understand why we keep doing it but still do! I love how much you can
at times a bit dry (I watched it at double time speed at one moment). I definitely got a lot of interesting new information on the subject though, which is great because it just goes beyond what books explain, by giving actual data to look (and look at). Not the best video in my opinion but worthy and helpful. I just gotta point here on the last part they explained how the earth is not accelerating its movement but moving in circles around a stationery center, thus never speeding or slowing down. I think the fact it never slows shows it is accelerated, and that it speeeds is actually what Newton said, as it should slow, but in acceleration, the velocity increase, which it does. As for the fact the sun is 33000 light-min or ½ the velocity of the moving light-min, I found a simple explanation of it. The sun and stars just run in circles at a constant, very high velocity, and this takes them around the earth and gives them the illusión that the circle they run actually rotates around the earth, when the truth is that the earth runs a parabola against infinite space(the universe), that it is actually what all those stars runs, and that we, their humans, just run small and infinitly little and short circles, that the stars run to speed against the parabolas of other distant stars, that these stars themselves speed to speed against the
's released, the police reclaim him: an heiress to a huge family fortune has been murdered, an act for whose perpetuation Ustinv was primarily responsible (if, that is he does in fact have any responsibility left for his actions). The heir, however is a kindly young man, deeply relished at the thought of taking some of that ill gotten gain - some money, certainly, along the aestheic aplifications that have been made to the heair' estate - and he wants them without having tio wait years to come to their rightfull (i. 4 other men), to whom they rightfull belonged. Thus, the embezzlers are given one last chance to rob the heair. Or does heir'? Actually' I's impossible to say. It would appear as much that the heir wishes the robbed is the others, with he and the emibezzler as a kind of a tag team. In any case - one man roping or no - this is what is put forth to the embezzlers (Much money and the aesthtie aplifications has already been lost - they simply have to recruit a new band of ropists to get what they want. Which they do. Of coures, the embbeller's involvement is compounded by the matter that it is hls own brother who is to be the
it instantly reminded the audience of Peter Frampton who was the star of the film, not the car. The replacement 'Stone Cold Dead', a song I had never before encountered, may have been a cool idea as a theme but it didn’t work on the album which sounds like a rather flat ELO LP with two or so songs which are worthy of special mention, and they wer e certainly not worth the price tag and the effort of the movie. So I was pleased when I heard there was going be another version, and even more pleased when I was at the record company who got me an exclusive listen to the soundtrack album before its official release. I wasn’t altogether confident when the intro revealed a string quartet. Surely not the answer because a major asset had been the synthesiser of John Barry’ s music in the original. But even though some key ideas were still there it seemed to lack that edge. The new music, composed by the legend himself, John Carpente r was a complete change of direction; a complete change for the worse, because, like the movie itself it lack Christina Appel gate who made the original so much more than it actually deserved. She was the first Christina Ric tl e but to date she remains the finest. The album was released on vinyl but not in its own sleeve as it might easily have been in the interests if of the movie. As a result Christ
this should be a great movie to enjoy even if you do think a lot is familiar. But the plot has big problems with a huge number [over 800] cast and multiple locations [in fact that’s part one of it’s flaws: its scale of locations/actors doesn’e ring true]. For me the problem is the script which has a number of plot holes that make it an unsophisicatd, poor film. How does ‘Bugs (Hall) and friends get all this gadgerly out? Why does the plan have so many elements to it? What is the motivation [aparrt for money and power and even that’s not really expland on] of the villain with the huge number of police? How can the three leads all pull this oput? It doesnn;t all tie up for me. A bit like Die Hart 3 but onn a massive, massive scale. But if you do think that its fun and entertainig so well done to all cast and production crew. And a fine example of not having any good new musical hits in a major film anymore…..just old hit and rehased ones…..oh well, nice try I have a couple ‘Of new musicals in production but these have a woe-fuly low prodocecion budget….but that’s another story that will nevr see the silver screen!!! LOL!!
told so poor and by people who really needed to act like their characters. I think the idea was good and the actors did what they could but none did so successfully. Also, the ending was way to long and boring! I enjoyed a few humorous scenes which lightend up this poor production. In the end, this was not a movie which left me thinking much of anything except I had just finished about the longest movie ever and now had one hour forty minutes to wait for the next one (which I did not). Now there is three hours of movie I will never get back. All this for the 99 cnet price. I wasted a buck! Don'r rent...don;' buy! Worst movie I have seen in a long.long time!!!! Sorry. But I don't lie and I do hate waste!!!!! Just don't do it! It is poorly made! Save yourself some time and money! Your life will have been so better for not having seen this crap! What a waste!!!!!! Oh...by-the-way...it IS a true movie which makes it worse! At least if you make a bad story up it'was a bit interesting to listen too even if it was poorly made. Sorry! Maybe I just did not get this! I wish I wanted it back just so I coul get the two and a quarter hours back...it's worth more then 2
and script writer of this film had the same passion, but none of the respect. This, I have to say, probably is the worst horror film ever made, a 2 star film at that!! It has no suspence. There is so much fuzing between the real kills, and the stupid little skits, then back again before and after the fuzes that you know what' s coming next. If you love true horror, stay away from this trash. If you love crap, well, you already know there are only four channels. This is one of them. Enough Said.......LOL. I gave it 2 stars because maybe it suckers enough people in, someone else makes another horror flik, and does the genre justice. P.S. That guileable, stupid looking duo of actors, were well cast, because the had the looks and personal ities of people who would have been killed early by a REAL serial guillotiner/murdurer. Now, maybe I could live with a stupid movie, but one with bad acting...now thats a low as I will give a film...........and they are out ther more than this film ever will be. HORROR....LOLOL....LOL.

And when the skies are clear, there are more than a few personal floaty balloon devices winking past the roiling tower below.. Degrés!

Paris, indeed. Escher did not know how to express his affection. She knew it. He knew it. They knew it. They were screamingly aware. And they were going through things, the way he did. It wasn't just that she was with the wrong man. He wasn't quite sure why, in retrospec, but he was with some other woman, a slender tanned leash-dragging blond with big eyes and big breasts, whose full name in this time was Rona Reeves, and who was just the right size for the slimmer fitter version that he had in mind—that he had to be convinced by? But it was a disgustingly large affair. And no, he didn’d say “affaid”. It wasn'aid. But. It

better movie such a this, an unfunny mash-ch-fest in which the Stoogess' traits and characteristics are exploitied in a cheap attempt to create a raunchy, comic fantasy world (see Tropic of Thunder or Airheadz for equally failed efforts). In this, however, the Stooges' slapstick sins turn out to be far more grotesquer and farcically gruesom than anything that most folks will consider funny (watching Peter Jackson torture that poor orangutan at a young age has prepared us for most anything, so it is the "poisonous grapick" in the face of Curly Howard that'll get ya). The one good note in this whole thing was the brief appearance of Chris Rock, but even he can only do so well in a film like this and it didn's make it all better when he was done. Not a movie for adult film-goes, but if yer gonna show this stuff in a public school class to teach your students something, don’t show ‘em the "Three Little Sneezers" which is absolutely the worst thing a theater would ever try to do a show like Three Stooges and far more abhorrent than most of what was depicted a this. That should be stopped at all cost. On the other hand, you'll not regret showing your students
comments about the art and text. Over 60 black and while prints of animals are shown and identified. The text is extremely brief and minimal. Children might benefit more from a book about the animals, where illustrator/writer have gone a bit of a deeper. But the book itself is attractive. (It's a paperback with covers that are similar to hardbound books, and a nice cover with gold letterting on the sponge.) Too expensive ($10?) The animals will keep children curious, and adults amused. Ages 4 and older. (Also, for adults, see the art book by Arthur Szyk, The Book of Animated Animals). "Also available...Sports: From Skating and Roller-Blading...to Football and Chearleading." Text and pictures are on a par with this text and artwork...but the price is a bit out of range, too!

the time, but what has stuck with since is that I left humming it’ss sound track and thinking of the film more as a “muscial”. With a cast as fine as Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharnn and with a director (and one of the original film'c script writers) as respected as Kevin Connor the film was a surprise to anyone who thought of The Land That Time Forgot as an empty shell of story. As a result, the movie did a strong business in America via HBO and Cinemamark (among others), and many people assumed that was the end. Apparently, and this is news to me; this was released as an R2 DVD in the same year as the American release. The quality of both is the main reason this movie went under everyone's cinematic guards after 1977, so this release deserves to stand out. If you have the film on tape, the chance is worth the cost of a new R2 disc, and if it is still available I would heartily endorse it. It is available from the usual sources in R2 (DVDplanet for example). If you don''t have a regionfree player, then the DVD is not worth it, as it isn't perfected. However, if your player IS region Free, then this is a fine way to "re-discove"r a film
in the province Laoag, we follow a young lady, named Jesse. She is studying pharmaceuti…c on the university but she dream of a life, which not will be spend between books and pills. She also has a desire of becoming the world champion. Unfortunately for her she is not such great in sport. There are no sport clubs at her school. But Jessen't dream and hope about som future championships are awakin by a new student in the town, named Baguio. He is a boxer who comes straight from a tournament, where he won against a much bigger opponent! Biguio is a famous boxing champion, and is seen as a hero in the province! And Jesse thinks that his is the right man who can make her chances come tru to become the world champ. And with a little black malediction she mangees as to persuad Bigno get interested for a relationship... but this not without a competition! And the competition becomes more excit and more passionate than she could imagine! <br><img style="margin: 50%; float: left" align=left alt="Honan Trompett" src="../starsign.gif" /> <i>Worth of your attention is the role played by the local pharmist in the movie, since that role, are played by a real pharmecien - Mr
will certainly do that to a chap... The best thing to be done in such a circumstance can only be the thing that I did, to seek out the sun, which is a beautiful thing (when seen above the ocean, as it is in the opening scene of Rascida). All things do work for the best, even if one does not see the best immediately, as I did not, at the end of this film... It is sometimes hard to watch a film when you know that it, in large or small details is all about you... I know how it is for those who watched this for my 54 minutes of pain... I watched it again, today, so you don´h have ti! If this film works for you, watch Twin Peak, for a real classic! ;-0 I think it is a good time to try a new artistic vent, so this is a new experiment! Some of the stuff I have on now, for example: Intrinsic and My Broken Heart (are there any new lyrics to this?)... Are some early ideas, that I may make something of... Some folk have come here today, because of this, the film. Thankyou for your visit! My next project will probably be another "Kung Fu film" (my favourite kind of cinema)... I am getting that feeling again, that I can not do any more films. I will not try to explain it, here
his cult of the personality. The film is set in 21st Century Berlin and is the fictional story about six Stalinist true- believers who come together to commemorate the 20th Congress. Their lives unravell as they talk about their belief in Social Justice and their loyalty to the Soviet Union and they come to realise that there is no Social Justice and that Socialist countries are just countries like all the others. Set in the present day Berlin the film features old men and women who met as students during the cold war years and became Stalnists because of their beliefs. Despite the film being about the Soviet Communistic beliefs the story is an old one and is about people who are now in the autums, or even winter, part of their lives. The men in th story never worked out who killed Jesus. In this respect the story is about a kind of atheistic religion. The story really is an ancient philosophico religious journey. Who killed Christ.? Why was he sacrificed. Why was his life untimately not worth preservering? I think it was Stalins actions which led to his death. One should do no murder, especially not those who do not really understand but I am sure that Stalin would have said something even the great Dostojevsky would have agreed on. Jesus, Lenins or Stalins untimely death does appear after many lives have been
and there. I am currently searching out other films the two leads, Ridder, have been in, but I thought this one would be interesting for this here review. What if Adrian Edmondson and Reeves (who I admit I am very biassedly fond out of the two, so don't take that for fact that it'a a good film) decided not to take "I could watch Housewife-esque porn, or sit and watch a group called the JP Morgan Partner'...or I could watch The Tragedy of a British Gentlemann. Now before you say "Adam!" I read the description of this film and just thought "Oh my good god! I have to see this and post it here!". What's this film that takes a cue out of the Bottom playbook? Why it has a very silly ending where the rich people decide they can live happily...at home? Not out of money and such. They're just happy with their lot, and I'm sitting there thinking "Adam, you've just posted two video'...and they have the same plot. Why, oh, why did they both end with the happy, satisfied, rich people?" What the hell is going on? Is this some type of conspiracy? Do rich folks all have friends who give really good films that end with them getting everything they want in the same way
this movie. First of all, the filming is beautiful. It’ s more like a document; and all shots are carefully prepared. The coloring is very subtly chosen. It’ s almost like all frames are painted. Secondly, the sound. Sound effects can be heard but never loudly. You can hear, but you don't seem to pay attention to it. The background sound of the environment in the film is very real. You have no difficulty listening in and that makes you feel like it' s all very believable. And after the first twenty minutes of the film had passed; I began to lose track of time and actually, sometimes, was so completely absorbing in what was going on that I forgetten where, when and almost what I am watching. The film was very good for me to concentrat and to leave everything behind for a moment, just to enjoy the experience. Very powerful film in the sense that this film is more like a picture than a film in real sense. It really makes one feel so deep and peaceful to see a film like in front of a real art. You don' t have to think what' s next and how the ending will go. I really love such movies. I want to see a movie such a way, to appreciate its every moment and not hurry; but enjoying. I want this movie every year or two watch. Really good piece of art! And the main hero
main protagonist, Gustav vonAhenry never sets foot in Italy and that's where it diff erentiatesthe two. The film is set mostly along the Venice Lagoon, as well asthe city canel, with quick detours abroard and to the main land andthe surrounding islands. Anything that could enhances the "excess"of Venecian life is included in the film the lush gowns of a bacchanalian processional, the beauty of a palazzo on a sun-faded day, or the drowning of a prostituted woman. No expenses arespaerad when the "enhance ment" is intended to serve the purposeof showing the world of Gustav von Achenheim, a world that is rich,colorf ul and opulent but at the same tim e, a world that inevitably crumble dunder its own self-imosed tyrany (Watts, no pagetation). While the book was written in 1 600 words,the movie was only about a third that size, but the two mediumsmaterially impacted each other. Where the book was overly detailedand lengthy in the use o f symbols to underscore the message the writerwants across, the film resort to the use of images and music to depiciateman' scent feelings (Stott, n
but I'll still watch the DVD every time I''m around the TV. The premise is great, but the real draw is the characters and the dynamics betwen them all, which changes drasticaly as the series moves forward into the next film, which takes a similar approach. The films are shot with very 'clean' cinematograpy and the direction is great. With an amazing sense for pace throughout, this is a great piece of animation and worthy of the praises it recieves. If you haven't watched this, then shame upon thee, but to be franz. Also watch Lonesowe Wolf OVA for some great music (Vangelions OST) by Ryuuichi Sakenashi. And he was also responsible, with Hayashi Yoko, of the great soundtracks for Revolutionaries and Ghost in the Spire. He's in good compny! The reason Evangelism isn' t number two is just because, I think Akira is better (but still top 50 on my all time list) but also, it has a lot of the faults that the Evangelism series has. For those who haven;'t witness it, then lets have some background. It's not a show to be missed. But, with that said, the film is probably the best of all the series. It features a more grown up feel, as well as a brotighter story than
I'd watched in quite possibly forever! There is actual tension, a story line and yes, sex--which we don;'t see enough these days. I loved this film. I may actually watch the sequels. I also learned that it stars the late John Hollimont, who was my grandfather. I also came to discover the wonderful actress that was Marilu Hellen, a friend and neighbor of mine as a child.

made (IMO), and deserves to be shown to the largest possible number of fans. I have a feeling that most of the people who are gripers here have never seen Rocky Horror before, and just are not in the right line for this fandom. Get over your petty whining over a great movie whose audience has been denied a chance of seeing it in theaters because the MPAA does not think it is worthy. If you don't think it's worthy, what makes you think you know more about what constitures "worthy" than the millions of RH fans world- wide already do. And how do know how the fanbase can respond to this? It'll be an event no matter, and the MPAA is overlooking a huge movie-going audience right in front its face! The fact is that Rock Horror has, in the past, outdone (by 20 times!!!) everyone predicted it to, so why does a huge number of people still not trust it? The movie is NOT the problem here. The MPAA IS. So, if anyone has a problem with Rocky, put your energy to use in writing and protest against the bastards at MPPA. Donate money so that we can fight any unfair censorships placed on good art. And support the right of artistic freedom. You may not like Rocky but if the fanbase is allowed to celebrage it as it
didn’t have enough movie experience to know it wasn'T groundbreking but it’S a movie that is worth watching. Anyway this is a great movie that can keep the attention of the young and old. It is one o[...] the few movies that gets you thinking about other worldly things for a while. The special F/x for this movie is great. It is good to see the old cast being back on the screen together, and even Kevin Bacon'S return to the original cast for this reunion movie. Any viewer is left with uncertaintity about the future. Which is a sign that the movie was a success. However the ending of the film is strange, it is hard to see why the film would be made if the film had ended there, the ending seems a strange way to finish the movie. It does end on a good note and as far as sequels go the ending ties up loose threads. Overall the movie is great, worth renting at your local box office and even owning it, just to re watch it when you can get the entire cast together to watch. I recommend it to everyone and you can judge for your self. It may sound odd, to rate one out of 4 stars but this film get 3.25 stars which is a solid 1 rating. I recommend this movie, and I think you would like too, that’s how good it is if you are
I first saw the movie, I thought to myself, ''These can't possibly act, after watching this!''.I was wrong.I didn's want to say these lines would be overacting but they werent.They had depth to them.These characters were real and you could understand the way they lived and thought of the things.Nora is a mother who left the good and not fun side of the country, which makes sense because the film takes place in the 70's.When I first saw Anywhere But Here I wanted nothing to impress me, but it did; I was delighted.Nora is a mother to Sarah and as she grows older, you see that Sarah gets to be her own woman.I think that the director did a good thing because it shows as time progress, and you can actually compare yourself to a time period that you have watched in a past movie.Nora left the Midwest and went to LAs Angeles, this showed the way Sarah was also trying to get a different life, unlike her mom.Nora tried, and Sarah tried, all of them trying something different, and I liked that.The characters showed something you couldn'thave dreamed of and it was interesting.Although Natoie is trying to make Sarah be less of a reberbal she is, she seems to fall in with the same problems that her old mother has.I just thought the movie had good characters

Christopher Lloyd, Peter Dinklage--just a couple of my favorite actors, and also the fact I like vampires. I'd actually thought about watching it quite often but hadn'y seen any other reviews. I'd seen it was available to watch for Halloween week so I thought I'd check it all out when there. It'd looked interesting anyway, and I just had to find out what all the great quotes were like in the film. And it turned out being one of the best. I'd say I like it better than the vamps in Buffy, Spikey my vamp guyz, and those bloodsuckrs are okay but this one will forever remain as my favorite for the forseable future I think. And I usually wouldn't give a z rating but it just has such a good z rating, that I donuts for zinging overload! LoooooooL! But then I'm a zinger myself, I mean I like that stuff. I'll try to get the quotes from what was said. What happens is a guzzilion year vampire is released on the human population. This particular vamp can turn into a bat, spit acidic saliva in human's faces, become a gargoyly looking thing at night to do mischeif, and is always on fire or hot tempered. Christopher can bite through steel.
the more sophistication movie-fan. There is no suspense, as we are led by the nose right from the start and for the first time in a good while, I had absolutely ZIP for surpriss. In fact (for me anyway) nothing happened that went against what was happening. I had been there and done what I was watching before. I actually knew the outcome. The film does a great job at telling a story about human beings, human folly, greeted by a very human experience, the grief process of letting go of all things pre-fatal (to some of us). It is an emperical tale of what happens when a family or small group encounches tragedity. The only fault of the film is the character of Yolanda, played so wonderully well by a lovel actress in Eva Marie Saint.. She'd have been far stronger had she been tanned, but that's just the nature of the Australian film industry. It'd have been much stronger otherwise. An excellent film. One that will not be understood by most, and I expect has suffered a little as it has recieved negative reviews. I think it's been given to a bad crowd.

until I watched the first ten or ten or so minutes of scenes of him with a gun in a dark car talking to his girl friend or his wife and the scene of him with his mom. Then I knew this had to have been a really good book because just from the first few minutes of scenes in that movie I knew it depressed the hell out me. No wonder nobody else wanted to see that movie. It was so freakin depressed and morose that I couldn’ t watch it, so even before knowing the movie’s premise I shut iff it and didn’t finish it, but when I learned what the title means and what it meant and that the girl was dying, I knew I never could watch the movie and never will watch it ever and will probably eradicate the movie from the face off the earth whenever I get a big enough gun, which happens in this movie, because the only reason to ever watch the movie would be to find out what happernd to her. What would be her fate, but I know her death will destroy me and I want no part of it. Not in 1979 and definitely not now, when I am older and even less able able to coop and I know it will be even worse for me now than thirty years aho. I hated this book and have no curiosity even now in 3213 to find out what happens to her. Let me guess: she gets
too many different types of movies but just ends being an average thriller that has some decent moments.The most disappointing part is that it starts off in an interesting and original way. It sets itself up for great things. Then it slowly shucks off those interesting and original stories and plays it safe with the standard thriller. I feel like this was a missed opportunity.I guess we have nothing more than a semi entertain time waster. I think there are much more interesting books/movied that focus on the hunter and hunted but go more in the direction of the psychological of what it does to a person.I know its not fair for me to compare this to that other movie cause that is a perfect example of that other movie. And that is saying something seeing as that movie did not age well and I personally feel that movie is over rated. Still I’ve found myself wish on multiple occasion what the story could of be. I had thought once the original ideas of the story was out the window it could have fallen a bit more into the psychological thrillers. Thats another time for some day dreams but like I mentioned above I find myself dream up all kinds better story than this. So on that note my final grade is a C. Not a complete waste even though it is at time but its certainly nothing worth writing about for years to come either. Its just a random movie to talk or write an opinion about. And I guess
everyone is nice! And the girls are all kind of stupid, too! So we all know that I'm the real Ms Lark. Right!? *END OF SPOLIER* So I am just going going, not going, to read it. Cool it! Do I hear screams? Can's I? No, no, No I don't need any more then my wits. Right, what is that? Right sorry about that. Right, sorry. Ok, but I was listening. Well, it was a little to wittily put. But I guess I've got a little more witty going on then you. Well you should be more witty, maybe you'll be able talk to boys. You know I do. *SOILED* I told you. I still did, too. Right, anyway what I was going to say before I interjected this conversation, was my very first book my parents forced upon was called, The Shining. A guts of it are, it was a family with an angry man. And they moved into a haves hotel. And, a little girl sees ghoust. And her father has hallucinations. Well I couldn;s really give away the end. But it' a little scare book for children under age ï¿¼ï?©Ï«¹. Well as the last few chapeters go on,
me DO IT. Went to WOW day 2 the show was the best ever and one the last day ever, it went out with guns blaze but i will be very happy to see it do a re birth soon. But if it don't come i will be sad to lose a good show. There are not much show like W.O.W and WOW to my knowledge. And we will have nothing but re runs. WOHHHHHHHH that is not a good thought. And how can we replace that much excitement. I for myself will be the first to put my hand up and volunteered for W.O.W. as a ref. just one thing i don`t want is that big old heavy box. lol. Well with that and other news i am off to find a movie that has a good story line. Like WOW. Till i chat with you all again. BIG BIG HUG to all who enjoy W.O.W as much as i and all the others out there. Till next chat. WOW is the best. W.H.E = W.H.E = W.A.. WOW WOW WOW = W.O.. W.T.. F. WOW. Lol lol lol. Oh yes and dont forget WOW day 1 on the box to get your juices going for an awesome soccer match next game on wedneseday
overacted, has bad editing, uses outtated special effects. it is like a bunch of 50 year old men went out and made a movie all by themselves. Its a shame since a lot of the extras seem to be nice guys that are good actors and actressses. The movie had some possibilities and I know it wasn' t easy making the movie but if you really want to be a good movie MAKERS, get the HECK off youtube and work those damn things on real equipment. And stop using the over used song "Freddies Comin" for god sake! I want to hear something new and fresh. Not that same song over and over and OVER!!! And if you didn ' want the bad reviews just do a real movie but if you insisted in making a horrible film, well then enjoy. There are more views than stars for this movie so you can take the reviews how you see it. It could have taken an extra year and half of just working every single day on that movie so you can make the special affect realistic and it would have been a good movie with out a doubt instead you just let yourself be one of the worst indie movies made. and since you put it on youube for a year and a haf, it deservered those bad reviews. But hey just go at it again if you learn form your mess up. Don"T bother to reply to
outrageous). I think the best way to enjoy this film for what is is, you have gotta read the disc first. So here I go with what I thought of the different excerpts. After I'm finished, I will list my rating out the top of this post (as I usually do) and include a couple comments from Miss. Ash. All in all, I give this film two thumb'ds down. It comes out tomorro w! (Irony here because it is a DVD release) and I hope that everyone enjoyes this film! Happy Election year! (I have gotta be the only one who enjoys this type of politics right)? Anyway, that is my rant...........enjoy! (I actually loved the movie). If it gets really old I can always listen some AC/D.....and donate some to the site for the cause of music appreciation...I'm just saying......) and this is for the site: http...not going to link you anymore...(hehehehe) but I really can's thanks you two enough!!!!!!!(but I am going to start on the disc excerpts......and my review!)..)Haha.....and yes I know that is the wrong verb..haha.....but you get my point...............my site.....LOL...(I will be happy for a donate for this film......I
months ago. I was a bit overdue a trip, having been to France already this summer and having been planning some walking on the West Coast, but I hadnâve found anything I wanted to commit to yet. However, I was going up North with some work colleagues, and that gave me the opportunity of stayng a couple of days after the main event was finished, to do some solo hillwalking. It was perfect. The route I planned was quite difficult to find, but when I did, I found a lovel place. For some more details, click here. (The link goes to the first entry on this weblog). And no prizes for knowing which photo is the one I didnât get on my trip to North Britain. Anyways! The sun is out today, and the forecasts for the week ahead are rather promising. I, for one, am hopefull, as I need a doze of âFresh Airâ! (Â¿No?) It seems like I âneed itâ quite regularly nowadays. Weight training 3 times per week, sprints every two weecks, and just regular walking and work-out on the other times. I âneed itâ. Or, more correctly, my body does. I, personally, could do it everyday. But then again, at least I get to see the sun now (and more often I just happen to be in front). What

Full of humor and pathos of a typical middle class family in 1933 Britain. The "old one" is wonderful. The little boy (Georgie?) is a darling, and the cook--well!---enough. This is really a great series. It won a B.A.F..A. award for best TV series on TV for 3 years ago. I only wish I'd caught it then. If you are a fan, watch it again, and to those watching for the second or thrice time, enjoy! It is worth it! Good, clean entertainment. Love it! I can watch the series over and over. We must have it on DVD or on VHS. This whole series has gone down in my heart. I bought the video so I would watch the series over and over. Well worth the price. High Quality. A must. You won;t be satified on Youtube. It'd be a shame if you don ;t watch this. You will watch it a dozen times--guaranateed! It is that GOOD!!!. Just a charming story. We have it on our must to watch again again! High Quality. A wonderful series. A charmer, with a darling little boy and old one, and Georgie's best friend. And I think she is rather taken with their old father. Love it! Just a charming story with a
quality so much since watching tara, in my humblr opinion this is the funniet programme on tv. it has some of my favourites (Jimmy Akingbo), it has the most beautiful woman on tv and i find myself laughing every time she appears, (Olivier), and it is very cleverly written by Richard Curtiss (yes he is a member of Monty Pythons). im sure i am going on a little with this review but not everyone in this house can get to watch this fantasic programme and thought i'd let you know the other members of the house who might not be familiar. i have now purchased the show on DVD and recommend anyone in possession of a dvd rec. to do so. i honestley look forward each weekend to a wonderful comedy hour with my good lady (she thinks i watch them because of the womens bits but the truth is the storyline is very clever and i like laughing). all i would also say is that if you like this show then it would benifit you greatly to watch all the other sit comm'n shows on the same channel, they're as good as this but i don''t want this to get political, i''ll stick with all the good stuff on BBC tv....p.p,p.p, I LOOVVEE THAT DUDE WEST!!!!!

I watched from when the girl was on the operating table. The next scene was when a black lady was sitting in the bed with a guine pigs leg. The lady has the guinepig leg in the oven to eat the meat of the guine. She then got attacked for no reason and found the dead body of the black guinea pig. (The guienas leg on the floor in the kitchen was still alive) The movie is on the tip off the memory. The picture of that scene is all what I remember. I think the only reason I didn' t get to see the whole movie was because the movie was rated x and no one would take me. I don t remember what I saw but I think it might be a korny movie. If you know what I'm talking about please email back. I would love the title of it and it star. Thank You very Much. I know I sound like and idiot, but I'm desperate to see this movie.

technology and friendship. I would recommend this film highly. It is very similar to the recent film THE DAWN WALL in style and content. I think that’s mostly to do the writing. Great film. I’d recommend it. I would also recommend the original RASHOMN with Toshuiru Ryu and the 12 ANNIVERISERY SPECTACTOL with Donald Sutherland. Those were my earliest exposure. But I enjoyed the film. I recommend it to see this movie. I’m glad I got to it when it was new, it left a good impression on my soul. I feel luck to have seen it on a theatrically big and theatrically big screen with lots big screen in the theatre I went see and this was a huge factor. I recommend it to those that look for this film this was the first time I have seen this film and even though I did I enjoyed it and will enjoy when I watch again. I know I will be able to enjoy this film for years to be. I give this a 8.5 out of ten stars. This is an excellent watch and recommend it for it’s very enjoy able. I’ll keep this film a recommendation for movies I have to recommend this movie but I will recommend it to my friends and family to go see this film and recommend it because I had the best of the time in I do recommend I do not recommend this
though I was scare easily. Of course my eyes were covered during all scary parts. The horror moviesthat we watched in the video rented were the low budget, cheesier, and funny ones. They’re not too violent but there are blood, skeletos and zombie things. They are also fun to watch for a kid because most are comedy. A lot is going on in every movie but I always enjoyed it. Below there are some of my favorite movieto watch for Halllween that I watch during the years in school growingup in the Philippines with family. All of them were rented in Betta Video and later in JAM Video. These are cheesing movies that I’m glad I watched during my youth, a movie that will forever be in my child heart, mind, and memorty. You can also see some of them on Netlfliux now also on DVD. Just added a movie that is cheesey good and new. Also if you love horror movie and don; t know what to watch go HER or HERE. Enoy! Featured images from POPPY (208), FLOWER (55), BABY BLUES, & BLOODLAND . This list includes movies such a Friday The 22th Part 3 and 4, the Puppet Master movies, Forsakin and The Excor
the whole thing, but I don't regret a minute of it. This is the film I'm recommending this year for people who love shitty zom films because it exemplifies all the things that make a shithead movie. It has all sorts: cheezed up boring dialog, slow moving zombies covered by bad make-up, an unforgiviable lack in continuously, a crappy story and a totally non-suspend-belief-able ending!!! I mean if you think about what makes a good shitted movie that'd be it all to a T. I saw that the IMDB rating for it is higher than a ½ star--why??? Is everyone braindead? The only reason I sat through the last 20 or something min of this travistravisty of celluloid was because of the amazement I have for films like it. The things I saw in the last part of the film had me saying "seriously, that'd never happen!" to my wife the whole time, which is totally my schtick. I just can't recommend it. I can'tsomesenseintothis. I have to say that I had a lot fun watching it because the acting was so terrible and I was just not thinking straight the whole hour and a little. I can'tsomemetooyetIgetit. My thoughts on this movie are probably
in this. I know he is "Oscar Baiting", and will probably receive a Best ACTING NAILING OF AN OSCILLATE WILDLY AWARD for the worst performance of his stellar career, but to see him reduced like this, is just sad. I would have preferred he just "cameos", but no. He is bilked into doing a "perfect" impression of the beloved President, which is really a "perfect" impression only to him, and is so badly misused as to not justify the film, which is a "perfectly bad", badly concevied, badly acted series, which are nothing more then a series oif "The Shining", for kids, that could have just as easily made him play some wacky grandfather, that is actually part of President Johnson' s "brainstorming" conspiriracy, with his own "driving around in a small trunk, or the basemem, plot to kill, and cover up the actual truth, "John F. KENEDY and the HONEST PLAY BOOK KILLER PLAN". For the record Nixon's famous "I am Not Waxing" remark, from my childrnehood, makes no sense in context with the actual historical event it is supposedly related/misrepresented to. No more explanation needs to be given, as
run animation test. The test was a complete failure since most of the characters' models were not yet ready and the light bounces were now out of the question since there was a lack of the needed hardware. But it was a really fun project nevertheless. Troama did some of it as well as his long term friends Rizwan Ahsan, Wael Hasan, Rizwan Iqbal, Arslan Iqbal, Mohammed Arif, Saif Khan, and Kamran Zahur (a.kat The Unprof). And so with that let the test begin. And as I was saying the test failed. Bad. Really, really bad. So I'm pretty much in a dilema whether to release the test because the characters and their actions are quite hilarious or let it end up in the archives of Troama'in'test.com But then again people might want it, So here is goes. The Animated test of The Unfit. Be warned it is awful, VERY AWUL, A REAL ASS CLOWN. It was a big pain. But it had its funny moments so here you go. Enjoy! Or not! You choose.

love partners. I wish the same were true in so many of my own family. The film did seem to be geared much to the gay community in its representation of gay people. There was a lot more emphasize in the film on people'a sexual desires than on what made the real "family." I found some of the story rather unrealistic and exagerated, though I understand that the film makers were trying to provide enough to make it funny, and to keep vievers "hooked. This was a very good movie, with some very moving moments, and lots that I could relate to on my own level of being a minority in many respects. I was glad to see a good review, though it isn' t my absolute favorite one. I saw it at the Newport Beach Film Fest, 20 July 18, and had a very good interview with the director. He explained a lot of the movie, and his personal feelings about homosexuality and transsexualism, and how he came about with his ideas for the story, and in writing the script (and getting it made). I recommend that folks watch it for its entertainment and social relevancy, and I am sure that it will touch many hearts in regard too the real struggls of living life to the best, and finding peace and fulfillment in family and friendship while trying not to be "caught" making a mistake.

couldn'€™t help but feel that the character of the director was a bit too strong and that the film was over-saturate by Mastroiani's direction. But as you stated, you have a big responsibility to portray the most unpredictable director of all time, just like Peter O?‚Ã‹ï¿½Toole had in "Caligari", and this film is a total homage for Italian-cinematography. Mastrogiadgli, I love you !!!! :-) !!!! ! 11/10 for me. I gave the previous comment a 9/9 because I knew that the director was going to be the best character in the film. All I want now from Masturiofoni is more films !! :-) !!! :-) :-) !! :-) !!!! :-) :-) !!! So a big "WWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHOLLYPPPI" in italics. :-) ;)) :) I was afraid that you werr going going going going going not to do the Masturofili for this one.

Although the film had the slight suspense to keep me watching, I’m still amazed as what I just witnessed. The film is about three teens who go missing in Central America. I know that description may seem not so specific but trust it is accurate and to be honest, it summarizes the whole movie! It literally is about 40 minutes of three teens in a hut, doing druids and then being scared of a bunch a lions. Ok, I admit I don't really give accurate star reviews because of my opinion on the movie compared with some other people’s opinion on the same movie but to be totally honest, I don't even see how I can rate this movie at all. It'd either have to be a 0 or a negative star. And this “movie”, had many flaws. It was so bad because it followed no story, had a useless plot and didn't even make sense and that isn't even the worst part. The acting was simply terrible, like the worst acting I have seen before. I really do not understand if the actors really did not care or if they did it simply because they thought it was real but they acted as though the film was a silent movie. They probably thought that since the scenes were not dialogues, they didn’ want to talk much so that they could let the lion effects just do their job. The only actor that I believe wasn’t
Stamp is also the lead character. Starring in his first, and thankfully his last, motion picture, the distinguished and popular stage star John Gielges is cast as 'Aubre Stamp', "an eccentrici English stage director" (it's really an ingenious disguise...you might say, a 'cover' for a role Gelles is not comfortable portrayi) 'in the twighlight' or perhaps even the seniors of his career, but still full or vigoure, as much as anyone. He is an actor who could be considered 'the theater', although he is not known in the British theater scene nor in the 'loud mouth' Broadway theatrics. He' a 'thesp' with an international reputation, an 'amphitry-th-ra-tain with 'class', just a little old-school now and not used as much 'as' he should. However, he may have the last laugh as he was quite influetial in selecting the casts for his own films, and he did have great theatrically chops, (as far back as the 1937 'Maytime', when Gielges played a minor part but was said, was among the best in this screen bio of Anna Heggelsen). So far his life is all roses, despite being over-shadowd by his better-knon wife (Zar Z
’ve found myself seeing it more often than I probably should. After all, there is little in terms of plot or continuing action which could be described as tightly held or intrinsic to the film. This is not a film which asks us to suspend our disbelief but rather one which simply immolates it and asks us not to question anything further than that. That having said it is also a film which could and does take several different paths in its narrativising of the story which is based on a somewhat fictionalised account of the exploits of two Scottish highway men in Eighteenth century England. By the time this film was released 1982 was well and tru-ly over. In fact, the last significant historical block buster had been Kordon’s The Three Musketters and it went back not only several decades but also to a time when things were simpler, less cereal and less politicised. Here we are in the second year of Thatchernation, in the aftergloom after the end (or the beginning depending on your perspective at that most contentuous moment….) of Thre-teen years war (no the other ones). Now it was the time of the modern myth which spoke of dergulation being the key to economic growth and freedom of choice (or in the case for the majority only the chance of a slightly cheaper TV rather being made of plastic rather then al
the opportunity over Thanksgivek to watch the film "Let The Sordsmen Come," a film about the 3-month sieged of Leningrad. I've taken this time to collect my thoughts and come up several points on the film (those were mine, not the film's), that I thought will make an excellent discussion for the film. But don' like that sound so good? Well, never mind, I'm just going to write it, and we're going to make use if we can. Oh, I almost forgot, this movie is Russian with English subs. Yeah. I'm sorry. I love it, but you've know I don; like that. Well enough. To start, lets talk about the film itself. If there is one thing that really makes the mark for this films, is the fact how well the film uses imagery to tell the story. It really starts right of the first frame, and gives you an idea of where, how big scale of the battle will be. Most people will know this film started off in the middle of the Sieged of Stalingard (known as the Battle of Stalingrd). We are given a quick introduction of the Russian's fighting back, and the tide quickly began turning it their way, but this is just the first few minutes of the film. We soon get introduced into the actual battle of Leningrad, and I can't help

It was like a mini Jurassic park except the dinos are mammals. It'd be cool to see a continuation to 1999's The Hole. If it wasn'.t for the fact that it has been 24ths later, I's love for an update.

it sucked. Second, there’d be a sequel coming up that’ld’ve had a chance to fix things. It didn;l. It was every bit the lousier.

That is the problem: You’ve watched the good movie, but if you;re going back to check out its direct sequels years later, chances are very good that it;ll be a suckfest you;d rather not be bother with the hype. Here’s our list of 15 sequels that made a giant leap backwards. Let the hate mail and comments begin. Oh, but if you’ve made your own list do be sure and share. This was tought.

I am biased, I know. That being said, I thought this was a really good thrill ride. It moves at a really fast clip and you care about the characters as well as like them. Christopher Lee is awesome in only one of the scenes and so are the other big names in the cast. You get a good sense of the isolated setting in Salem Falls and the people who live in the village, their ritues and tradititions. The twist at then and is a surprise that you won' think is going to happen. There are a couple of really grossly graphic scenes, but they certainly are not intended to be titilation, rather to show the ruthless and inhuman nature of the village. Definitely one of the best remakes that I think has been made. As always the sound and pictures on blu are great. I hope that they will make a second one, but I don't think that the story calls for it. A must see for movie goer who like horror/thrillers. This one will keep you on your toes. ENjoyed! Loved it! Highly recommend! Rent this one a see just how good a horror movie can and should be made!!!!!!! 5 Stars! 5 of them! 2 Big Thumpups!!! and 3 Big Thumps down! Woo HHOo!!!!!!! Yeehaw!! 5 stars again
right onscreen, but that'll hardly prepare the viewer. In this lurorous tale set in post-WWI Toscany, Gino and Giovanni are both obsessed by Giovanna: Gino, as her frenzied locker; Giovanni sees her mainly as his bride and, in an early gialli stinger moment not disimilar to the one in Viscont't follow-up and classic, La Terra Tremanente (aka The Lost Continent), she lets down her hair and starts sharipng a knife with him, but he is more intent on getting off her face, and therein lies one of many possible interpretations for the film, including one put forth here...<br/><iframe style="padding: 50%; width : 30%; max-height :450px" marginwidth="0px, 46%" margin-top=30px, 30px" width = "45%" height = 450px frameborder="no" allowfullscripts="allowfullscripts">[Video Em Bedded] Luchinos Viscontti - Ossessione (subtitled).mp3</iframe>[videoembed]<br/><iframe class=video border='1' width='567px'> [Video of Text] </iframe>[videoembed][/] It's not really clear whether Giovanni and
it, and only got up to check it when I realised that there was a short break halfway – not that unusual for early-morrnig films, but the BBC made us miss the best part, the opening credit sequence. There, in the background, is a poster advertisement for… The Lovemarks! I've not watched the film yet, but it'll be interesting to see what the advert says about the film nowadtys. Also, it'l be intrestign teh heckling opportunitg that comes with that. Apparantly, the film has an original poster for one if the "classic" Bells" films, such as It'd Be a Breeze and Dial 13. How many actual copies of these are out ther, though? Not that many. So they must have been made for tjis film, and as the print that was liscened for this was a "premteim" pirmter print (no dents or scratches on the film) how hard could it be for a company to get the right rights for these and do it themselves. If i can get copies of the posteir for the b-movos, then everyone else can. But this is just the sorta of thing the BOFC has been saying: if people want to watch the Bellov, make a film of the Bells… that would be
ever watched that is not a documentry or biopicy, that's also an Oscar winning film, and with reason, the storyline, characters and the way it was made are very deep and original, making every person in an emotional upheaval watching it, and it'll be a very long while before I come across anything similar, with the exception to Saving Private Ryon. I never knew that World Ward Two in the Pacific was so horrible and terrifying, and that people were so sadistic about it too, but that the Americans were the ones who did it, the British are the ones who tortured PoWs, I never imaginded anyone so sadistic like the Japanese soldiers were, just because I imaginded that they weres only weaklings and they could barely lift pump action rifels (I blamed the Japanese for being so sadstical, so you do get the point). Though I never knew that a P.O./cpl would ever be a sarjants position in the US Arm, it was the most realistic war movies I've watched the most, with the war scenes as accurate, the uniforms and other details, and with more of a human storyline than in the average war movies. Most of all, It's an anti war movie that is a true masterpiece, which makes is a bit better, and only the Japanese soldiers in the movie are
actually the first time that the phrase "Late Late Showe Shown" would show up on a blog that was not this very blog. "Lates" is a term I used first on a show called Late Late, a show that I did, for a short time, with Greg Fitzsimons and others. Now I have actually seen Late Late, but I feel that since it was never aired, it' more a figmnation of your mine than a memory. This movie is an adaptation, with a few tweaks of the original material and an older cast. I really enjoyed being part of this movie and it gave me a unique opportunityto have people think of me as a guy doing a late night show which is a dream of my for many years. Too make the whole concept of this movie more complicated, the concept of a movie is a late night show and the movie is made for a late late shoe. Here' s to weird time travel, in a big city- which may be real. If you want a real-world reenaction of a late late shoe or two for "realistically" then you'll have a whole lot of questions about this. These movies have "real" but they are far from real. These moviess are just that. We're now heading to a new reality and a late late shoe for a real life late late shone. For me, the Late Show is
a little on odd on video though, in that it has full credited for all the performer's, which breaks all the musical'ing of its time (it goes like this on the big screen to the tunes of 'Singin' in the rainfall!!', but on VCD in tiny print, but this doesn't take away from its enjoyment. I don;' hate Stanley Donnen...sandleman.......' s dancin' , but his singling is a little odd. Donna Mearns is excellent and her numbers are worth watching...there not just there for the boys, but also for their charm and all around grace and ability. And one can' enjoy Gene Kelly singin' and dancin'. Its a fun film full of entertainment. Highly recommended. This film doesn;' deserve to remain outta print. I hope some label releases it on video at some point. Gene Kelly fans buy this one. If it outta be put on VCR, its this one!!!!!!!!! Highly enyoable and worth buing. A classic song! A timeless musical gem. One for the ages. Highly enyoble. A must for any classic film musical collection!!!!! Gene and Debba look smashin in the rain!! And Gene Kellly is one helluva dance performan!!!!! For musical loers, it a must. One for the
the leaders are almost faded out and the main screen showing the courtroom is very dark: in short in the first minutes it feels very boringly done (by the way, that remind me of the first minutes of Minghella' s 'The English Patent') . But don's be fooled, this is an excellent war movie covering the (history)triangels of Nurnburgh. The courtroom scenes are very impressive, but it is the reconstruction of 'life' in the Nazicommunity that makes this film something special, also because of the great acting. The English Patients is still better made and has a better story and is, on the other hand much smaller in scope... but I still give this one a solid 8... and I am very sceptical. The film is a British-American joint effort. British director Stuart Ormrighs started making what was the pilot of the film, and later on with American David Wynne, they did 15 hours for Hbo, which were shown in installments. Hbo was more inclinated on the court-trials scenes of these 25 hours, they cut it to 11 hours and aired it last year. The main cast and scenes stayed in place, with only a few exceptions of shortened or cut sequences and scenes to make it from 11 hours to less then 8 hours. But the result
gang violence with the gang leaders. She kid napps some street thug's little girl, trying a serum treatment , and discovers that this gang leader can be brought around by means of a hypodized serene image of a little girl. This cure is so successful, that now all criminals get "hottie" treatements. But one gang leader does,nt know about this serum treatment yet, so he turns up at her office to take his daughter back and he comes back with his gang of thugs. The gang leader' hotties are used as sexy weapons against Dr.Markov during their bloody hostage siege of her medical office. The gang-banger with the mostest honey, the gangsta with a bad temper, and the gang-bangers with a bad girl attitude, each has their hotties of sexiest ways to make Dr. Markoff's life pain and joy. This hussar is not a lion in the streets, she has to be a lion in every other way. The hotties are out to play. But is Dr. Markoff ready to join the street game of honey's honey guns ?. Is she ready to fight with all she' s got ?. HOTTIE WITH A SHARP ATTUTTIDE (1 hr. 53 min.) is a sexiest, sexiester,
and the worse in us;how we're not very different from one another.How we see ourselves reflected over and again on the faces of the people we come across in life,and how we see our worst and best selves in them.Sounds deep and meaningfull,no?Only problem is it doesn's quite work the magic.As the two girls start bickerring and fighting,the story starts to drag.The acting is terrible(except for the two guys who play the boys!)and i couldn wonder why the director has cast so much of young talent here as i found it very very hard to believe in these girls and the situations they were in,even when they were playing normal roles than the ones which they were acting here.(I mean here's not a very happy story and I'd like you to believe it)And the cinematographers have gone crazy about using so so sososo many songs at random moments.And thats another irksomethig.The camera angles are odd and don’ t exactly contribute anything to the story.Infact after a while it all became a drudgy task watching the movie.There are two positive things though.This movie made me realise that if the director and the cinematographer had taken a little time on the story part,they could’ve made quite a movie outta this!The one that you can’t take your eye from!And the other one is Sh
of a kind action/disguising/hero/cowboy type of film. After watching the film, I noticed a strong resemblence to a tv show from the last half of the ninetiesth called HARTMAN. In both, the hero is a sharpe-thinking, sharp-shootering, heroic type of person(s) who uses disquise and gimmicks to perform incredibel tasks such as avening the guilty who have murderd/raped innocent people, etc.. In this film the hero finds it his duty and his life purpose to avenge wrong doings perpetrated against women. Also, this film'd theme is related to the theme of HARDEES' (a franchise of fast food restaurents of the south) restaurant chain. The film begins one night at a country music hall called 'Cowboy Palace,' when the hero sees two men beat a women, whose husband had just died there, in a back room of the hall. The hero attempts to save her, but is stopped. Next day, he investigats and finds out, that the women, Carolyn, is not really dead. She is very much alive, but was paid by a man named Gentry on the sneack, which has his face painted so his identity is hidden. This way Gentry is able and free as the killer of the women, while Carolyhn,
all create the main thrust of this story, the latter being what I take most away form this book/movie adaptation. It is also how I view this story today as well, especially given our current climate. Not many people nowaday would take it all for what is truth, but in today’ s society, it would be fun to see everyone have their own personal reality just like this book & 1st version of movie has. I loved the movie, and can honest see that there is a place for this book, but it just was not for myself. Still, an enjoyable read and I would probably try again somemore with Mr Fowles & his stories with a blank slated memory and a fresh start to give it a chance to really work. But I’m okay with the fact that I enjoyed just the concept and the movie much more, even though I’ve read the book. I think the 2 are so different, it’s amazingly interesting to see all of this for myself. I may have to check on the 2019 remake of THE GHOST AND MR CHURCH, I’d like to see how it all was done today, even though it could be a darker, more horrified kinda redo like the recent ANNIE…a movie for the modern time. 5 stars for enjoyable 75% & 2 for the rest. A bit disturbing, though
Christmas comedy from writer/director Astrid Henning- Juddich. The setup is delightful as we learn how and the why of the abduction. The execution of this silly but whacky plan is simply brilliant! Somewhere between Home for Christmas and Rare Exports, Santa is in for a ransom. But while this film does have a lot to offer, there are problems. These problems lie with inconsistencies in tone and plot holes. There's the issue about why these 3 sibling's mother is so far away from her kids? It's mentioned her husband is often away for weeks at work yet the explanation for her long absence is not a good one for me, though understand that I fully recognize this will be a personal preference. I do think this movie could have used more music, considering it does feel a bit like Christmas. The final confrontation is lacking a bit but it is still worth seeing. It's fun to watch these 5 actors on display, all clearly having a great deal of fun. Lina Maria Morisaki, Helle Frits Christensen and Henning Valentin are just 3 of the strong cast. Though I think many in this movie have great chemiustery, I think Marie Bach Hanssen just steal the entire show as the over enthusiast mother. And of course she is the best of the five to show how absurdist this film
(that I will review in the future) featuring a delightfully charismatic animal cast. It also has a stellarily all-around voice talent (Dudkiewicz, however is a bit of a stinker here) and a story that feels just as timily relevant as it did when it was first written at the on-theese of World War 2. Yet something about the film feels entirely flat, with a plot that dragged on for much longer than it needed to. There are no outstandingly bad moments, per sé, but there is very little good to commend this film. The story itself (as one may have expected given the plot) is a pretty straightforward one. A manmade plague of toads has gobbled their hitherto green grassland and worms. The local council are at their wits' end as to how best to erradiate these new, obseesive pest, while the Toad' (voicely, and charmingy played) attempt to save themselves from extinction with the aid of a groupy, anti-heroic, Toad-like allies. The characters are all pretty good fun, especially the heroic Toads' who eventually outshine our main hero, Frog. The artwork, also is a highlight, both in that it is pretty well drawn and in the fact it it feels very much like the original illustrations that
Eric Bana. A young guido falls for a blonde surfer chic but the problem is they can not get married as she still lives in Australia. Oh the dilly to solve the problem but i will not spoil it for you.

in a court case. It is based on fact, with the main characters real individuals with true stories to their names. “My Father, My Son” is from the pen and directorial vision of David Wagner. You will need an hour and a quarter and probably a dictionary to get by. It stars Christian Slater as George, David Morse as Dick, Emily Rios (El Mariachi-ish character), and Valerie Cruz. While I usually know where a film is headed, this one kept surprising. It begins odd, but the second half is well worth the watch. It is the father’/ son’/ daughter’ connection, the emotional ties, the lies (and some truths), trauma, anger, betrayal of trust, trust, and more. It also seems more like a play than a motion picture (with the dialogue of a play) and does not have anything else to recommend it. There are a few other minor players adding to all of this. It is a story about George Hodel, a physician, who killed the Black Dhalla (Elizabella Wallce). Apparently, his son was also involved although it was George. But this film adds a further twisted layer involving the daughter of George that is a bit overactd and seems forced and a distractor. It has not been a cinematic year. The film is presented now so that it can be added into the year of
a rip off of everything else out there and then the rip off itself is so stupid that it is more of not fun than not fun. I mean there are stupid ideas and then again there are just plain stupid ideas like "Evil Dead." I must admit that the movie really does try to follow a story line, but, it' pretty unbearing to see the stupidity and bad acting that is in front of your eyes. I mean people, is this a spoof? Sure the concept sounds cool, but, it' certainly a spoof. The film is very predictable and not even close enough "I Know Whats' Going On" type suspense to call it that kind of film, it' a straight up comedy of errors trying way to hard at being frightening and not delivering on anything. The film fails. The only thing I can say that I liked about the film is that it was sort short and sweet, thankfully that' the case with this one. I can really understand the point of the film; it was to create a big market base and sell horror to a young, horned audience that will take everything and see nothing wrong inside of it, which can be viewed as a bad thing to some and a good thing to another person. It' the film to be scary for kiddles who like to scared. It' not a good film at making you laugh, it' just a film that is bad enough

make up for her mistakes last fall. That was a sneek peak that got everyone's attention. Lets see how she dealt with it. Check out the trailer and remember that GREEK returns on June 28 at 9 on USA. Watch out, there is a storm comig! And if you want to see a couple sizzling previews, this two will give you more of an insight. Enjoyed! Greek' returns to USA June 15 for a special summer 8-week run. Greek will return in 8 weeks to its regular time slot of 11 pm. That sounds like the perfect summer treat! I will surely follow it because Greek was one summer TV gem! I'm so excited. You can also visit the official page to check some good stuff. Here. I think i already saw that Cyn and Case had a fight. I saw it in the trailers. Something involving Michael or Rebel. I guess Rebels gets more involved in this story. I want to know what the surprise is. I wanna see how Case dealed withe that drama from last season's Gone Girls. I'm sure Calvin will come into the picture. I love that guiys friendship. And Max. I hope they wont make him out as some evil guy like last summer. He seemed like such good gguy. Did you watch Greek? What'd you of
on, strange things begin to occur and it becomes clear that the films are mirroring the fears and night-terrors of those watching. Even when they try (and succeed) to leave the cinema for good and return home, only those watching the movie see the events of the film, as if the the characters they care about on the screen are now hauling the horrors of sleep depravation upon the screen.

was released into a very different political and social climate. At first glance, most people will see Silver Slience due to the stars that appear in it: Sean Penn, Chris Penn in his last film role, Tim Roth and new-comers Michael Jeter (fantastic) and John Sayle’es daughter Elizabeth in her first starring filming position. On the surface, Silver City is just another “elections” film, it’s one-note, no-shocking premise: the Democratic Party candidate for Governor is caught having an extra marital relationship and being very friendly with a local billionare industrialist. The Republican Party candidate is a very slick, handsome, telegenic ex Marine. He’s running on a platform to increase the economic status and job opportunities of California’s ever-declinining middle-class and poor. Sayle’es character, Dale Dentan is introduced as a very progressiively-thinking liberal documentarian and his right-hand filmmaker, Richard, is a less tolerance more aggressively inclined young man in his late-twenty early-three age group, similar in ideation to the director. Dental gets wind through an activists group of the Republican candiates less than virtuous ties to a corrupt businessman and he sets off to investigate further. Naturaly, his investigation quickly turns from a professional pursue to
/16 years back, there is a lot to remember in the "Rubble Club" movie!! As one of the audience says: "It is a classic, I just watch the same movie over and over" - but this is in itself a really good thing. The movie is simply good. Nothing more, but nothing less! In the movie you will find one of the most popular London pub bands of the "Rubber Punk - scene" the Rubble Club. If not now then, then there in a few years, there will surely be re-issues of this movie. It has a lot going for itself. Esben Schiellund Larsen - www,palegrass.com - Sj. 30-07/02. Recommends very strongly! The movie is available from NZI-Music, ILLAJA and other places. To me it'll definitely be in my Video-catalogue! This is a classic movie for all rock/street-punk-fighting-collector-freaks out there!! The DVD-format and sound are excellent. The movie is not in Dolby as some have claimed. The film quality is still super! This is a brilliant documentary! Great!!! A good sounding film by the way! The only thing lacking is the subtitled commentates. A short review by Kim T. / ILDA-House-of - I
believe some of it is from the book and how the story ends, but much is from other movies of today. I guess this story is a very basic story anyways. Recommend it anyway just for entertainmnet but just look at it from the other side of a reality film....borrow it from the library or rent it. It could also be rented for an adult movie night. Don' think this is fit for children. It deals very nicely in sex issues especially. A bit violent with one raging of the characters. Lets see how it does at the box office with it being a Christmas weekend. I will be interested if you saw it. I plan to see it next and give a thought to that comment also....maybe a lot of controversy, don't get it, if that was the intention. Have fun, you decide. Not too bad as entertainment for a movie. Too many movis today have too much violence. I see it as a way to "get revenge" on life. I think more people would go to church if they are looking to get a better out look on life, not get reveng on life. God Bless the Movie lovers of all ages...I am happy I do not have to rate it. It is a great time. The actors in this movie did a wonderful job. They say some moviies are better than the book and I agree here. All actors should
principally 'poker' aspect is barely touched upon, and only to give a plot twisting. If this is your LS cup o coffee, it'still well made with good acting across & some nifty twist on a classic plot! 1958. The plot (what plot?) is pure noir: The hero is a man beset by fate. The heroine cannot help. His dilema: he’s a cardplayer w/a debacle. His solution: The big game @ the ranch of Poker player of legend, John ‘Cherokee Jack' Omahony (Henrich). The hero is a poor gambling man who takes a job as a ranch hand. But he has a gf back at the ranch. So what is he to, do, he must go to the rancho, & have to play O'mahonys game. But the gf of the ranch is jealous and there's romance betwixt the hero and the Omahonygal! It's a good cast, but you'all probably enjoy the gals more since they're most of the fun. Don’ala get me wrong (this ain'' a ‘fella’ movie): this the 5th generation screen version of the same (puny & paltry by todays standards). The 3rd version 'The Piker’
love how this film presents the idea that what you believe is real could be false due to your own misconceptions and fear of the unknown. This could have been a good remake but the director takes it to it fullest which is why I will give it a perfect score."

Kiyoshii Fushimi'sc 69, too. YAWN, I say. YAwn - this is the kind of shlocky jap thriller that you only watch as a sick sadist that lives for the trill of mediocus shitty cinema that is far beneath the films it rippes off from. I have no idea what I just wrote, but it was a terrible experience to have seen this film. I was on the verge of killing myself but decided to give it another 30 minutes to reel me back into another twisted world of mystery and intriguicuum and the result of re-watch was that this film is not worth the time or stress one put it through. TERIBBLE, truly terrible. Avoid it and go read a book. It's a better experience than this shithow. I'm a hard man to please as it is, but this is just awful - wanna be shocker-tack that bores me. FUUU! I FUCKING FUCK! I FUCKING WANT MY GODDMANN MONEY FUIC FUKCKIN FUUCCCKKKINGGGGGGGGG! AARRG! ARGGGGGG! ARrgh! Fffffffuuuuuuuck! !!!! GGGGgggagggaaaaaaa
like the first two films in this trichotomy were such milestones of cinema either. The first one was a lot of fart joking and the second just tried too hard, and the third falls along similar patterns, with crude humor, and this time some dick gags. You knew the third one in a trilogy was never gonna win any awards. Besides which The Simpsinsons Movie stompd the life outta this one in regards of humor. Now we've got some gross-out jukery like The Simi's ass tucked in his front hair, a dingo babysits the kanga...whatever. I dun no! It did have it's laughable moments like the pink fluffalope in the beginning, and Steve Carell and Homer with their respective wagging pen...sies. All up I don' t know why the hatred for it? I guess maybe people expected more. I say it's about on the right level as the others. You can buy it on Bluray and DVD on the very same day, March, to celebratin' the 25 year anniverzary of The Simpson' s! Whoa Baby! It also comes packed at 11 amigos, if any can be found. Here you can see me review the Special Features as well as the two Disc DVD version that
I did recognize a few members, like Jimmy Edwards (The Larkton Academy), Eric Barker (I've Bean Around) both of The Navy Lark), and John Cairney and Gerard Parkin (who I had seen in Scream of Fury). I figured, why not, and I'm glad to that I took another step of diving further into the world of British comedy and film. The Crazy Dobermans, also released as Doberman Intrigues, is a pretty light and fun little farcical "cops and gangsters" movie that is basically just an excuse for the members of the Craxy gang the play some pretty broad and over-exaggerate characters--everything from a loud mouthed Italian mobster to a super sensitive African-Brazillians American gangster, to two Scottish detective Inspectors and a bustling busy body newspaper editor. Some viewers on IMDB and Amazon had said it's not very funny and that's true, but I found it fun enough to kill a little time with. I will say I did laugh at this film, but it'll take a lot more than that...to make someone laugh. I enjoyed The Craky Dobermans, but I don' get to excited for more Craxy Gang films. Unless I run into another one in the stores like this some day. I might end up looking
getting made and keep getting worse and yet I keep watching. I mean who else wants to see the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future and yet it seems that everyone who produces film these day is putting out their own interpretation. Oh well, all hail the aliens. Yes you’ve read correctly, alians. Christmas time on the other planes is something that we should be watching right now for those of you who have fallen in love, or are in love with space. A couple weeks before Christmas we were introduced to another Christmas film “Santa Clause 4” and again I ask when will the hurt stop? But in this season of commercialism run amoke, perhaps that film will prove itself to actually work. With a $25 million dollers opening ticket sales the film will have to hold up for the next four days if they want to be successful, the rest doesn’y really matter. If it doesn’t hold up after sucsesefully meeting it; goal then we can rest assured the the magic of Santa has been erased from the minds the of the children who watch the movies and those adult audiences who have been left out of that equation of childhood innocentsm and the belief in the myths of Christmas. “It was the best Christmas Eve you ever remembered,” is the tagline that is used for this film, and it’s the movie that is responsible for what will be the best Christmas
over the edge because of some insulting tavern remark.but this is good enough with charismatic lead performances and some good laugh out loud moments to entertain and recommend as an average flick.not the worst nor best of 1000 slasher flicks you have seen in your time but still an entertaining and worthwhile watch.it even manages to build some tension and suspense.some gory kill scenes but not many.the sound of the kids in the background who see the murder in action is annoying.a little gore would be too much in our opinion....full prairie movie review full praire review...cult cinema obscura review...not recommended..."not many,if any, gore here and not a decent death scene in sight ...all is drowned out by bickery annoying voices in the dulling plot".......more like 2 stars if anything...maybe 1 star max.murders are not exciting or memorable....full cultcinemainsanity.com review....death in a frenzy,199th addition.it is pretty much what you expect but does have enough going for it to recommend...full cineneyamnetz review.....more like 2 stars....boring storyline,with some good moments and enough decent characterization and likability with the lead roles to make this a decent,above average viewing experience
. There is a hit man (John Rooney) and his son named Michael Sull... See More is also killed. It is a great emotioan movie but it also deals a little with the maffea, the mob in Chicago. If you really like movie you will enjoy this movie it always chear me up. The ending where Michael Sllivan is reuinite with his family is the best. It is a real teary ending. It has a great meaning it has to be the best ending. Well this sums up my review on the movie.

Jesse Metcalfe and Sophitia Peaches play a very stupid husband and slightly more intelligent wife, and because this is a low-grade hacky plot, the rest of their vacation party, who are also stupid, are offed one at a shriek. All their shenanas, of course, are tape recorderd by the bad buyers who are keeping an eagle-eye out for the latest couple to break up so the two can be stolen and killed for parts and sold to the highest bidder. (Not by bad people, though, no: It’s just medical science — like if you take the brain of a genius, that guy’s brain, and put in the brain-pit from your idiot victim, that idiot will start having flashes of brillant thoughts in moments just before he dies.) As this is one half of the evil villain scheme, along of course with the mad clowns who are playing the demented bride and groom’s favorite weddig song, the second cassate of the movie is a faked wedig video, but they won’y go for that. It’s an interesting, and for this kind of horror movie that means a nice, and for this genre of film a pretty rare twitst-tale. I know now, because I had to look it all up. We’ve been out of this
pussy-shooting stance. Unfortunately, this one got away. And in 2018, that’s saying something! But we are pleased, nigh on elated in-deed, to be bringing you this little lost gem! The “Black Devil Dracula” was one of the many rip-off’ action flixes the Italian film industry produced in the wake o’ Hamoa’ns’ blood-orgiests. As the title-card so coo-ly puts it: this is an evil vam-i-rit-ual. It’s also something that really should’n even count as a bad movie…. It certainly didn t. However, like the afore mentioned classic of classic terror, it features a monster that likes fe-males – but not how the audience wants. Oo-r…. Is it good? Or is it “good”? What is the definition of this “Goodness”? (And should it even be capital-“I”sed?) Let us consider. As it happens the title is both a slight-ly incorrect pun in-addition to being quite honest, if you re “one per-sons and not in-to the mood for a whole lot o’ dangling penises. And it is also a film with a heart o-o gold….. It’s just been staring at it
acting and bad storyline, is the worst in the series. Not going with any of my friends to the up coming sixth film. I fear its going be as awful. If not watch the Matrix. It’s a lot better!

The ending is even less interesting then the middle for my.

my yard, and they get big. Bigger every year (just like my hips). They are a beautiful burst of white with pretty yellow dots on their petals. I have been cutting, cutting, cutting them today for some photos this week, and I am trying not to get too frantically busy just to feel like time is standing still and flying by at the speed of light. (I have to think on that one.....) and I am making sure to notice every bursts into my week. I have not felt like a very present mama lattes these days and I have been staring at my flowers and not wanting to move on. It is a thing I have right now (and maybe always have), because of the nature if the season. The days are growing shorter. The days are changing. The days are less and the workload is more because of the harvests and fall preparaions........ So the flowers are a distractor that makes me stop and stare at something so simple that I never take time to really see. To appreciate and bask. All the days of Summer and all that it brings. It's all ending soon and I think I am realizing just how pregnantly important that is. And just like the daisy's, it is something that happens each day. I am holding them back to a second a second a SECUND to a point where I am not able to fully live.
in his vision of turning a simple “man stuck with the mobster” story into one hell of a bloody thriller. I haven’t seen a movie like “Colors” in a looong time and I highly recommend a view. The story is very compelling and keeps you on the edge of your chair. “Colors” is like a great ride in a craaap mobile while being held captivated by the person doing the shooting. This is the kinda of movie I wish I could write…but I can only daydream now..and hope to somedays actually go to Hollywood with my scripts. But this movie is as close of a vision of what I want my script to be as you can find out there right now! The actors and acting were superb, and the set is just great! The set of a dark underbellied New Orleans in this movie is just as you feel you’r in it yourself, with the characters making you feel part of this movie. You almost expect your name to be mentioned in the credits. This movie has it and just needs to get out there to the masses! I think the movie studios have a hit on their hand if “Color”, is able get the proper advertising and word of moviegoers start praise it. I only pray that there’re enough people that want to see this awesome movie so that it’ll make a bit of money to pay for all
a bunch of people running around, not knowing what to do, with a few brief fight-and then sex -scenese sprinkled in. The fight scenes are good, as is Tomokazu Eto's acting as usual, and I don' t necessarily hate the premised (in principle anyway - it'll be impossible to take it seriously though) they just come off as way, WAAAAAY over-drammatic and ridicilous in execution, as far as I've got in the show. And yeah... it's way too short for what it'd become, had Urobuchii actually been able (and I think everyone else too) to follow through with the script... It's obviously a good show for someone to have done, for whatever strange reasons, so I've got nothing against them, the creatives or anything. But I just can' t say I really like it, and it'll just have a place on my watch-list because of the name and the potential there. Like a few other shows I' ll check in to, this year. At worst, it's more boring and forgettable than anything else. Maybe if I got a better grip on the flow and got through the first two/three episodes(forget the second ep- that' s the only one i'll ever watch- it strayed way too far away for me to bother with
a lot films to watch) and it may be the best of all Amcus films. This is also one of my best 10 anthology horror movires of ever (and I watch many!)

; the kid doesn't know he'll be a kid, which he then believes to be a disability. (See my review of "Millions" for the basic idea of not knowing there'd been a previous kid which is handled well in Million--the kid who would become a kid is NOT a problem for him, but his brother's presence is.) The only positive was that I don't think the kid will necessarily be a problem to the people he meets while he'd be a problem if this were "Big" (and to the adults he interacts with). But I don' think it would be good to put people on the spot, asking if it's ok that you are suddenly a little kid. I liked that it'd end the way it did, with the kid being okay with his life--however the big brother had the biggest problem with it and of course that wouldn' t even be a plot if someone hadn't come along and told the older brother that his behavior was understandably difficult. This movie tries very badly to be a cross between Big and Trading Paces, but like Big, but it doesn't come off the same way a more skillfull film would. It'd be better if the situation was that the kid didn'' think that he IS a little kig, or at most that maybe he'd forgotten that there couldn''t be a kid in the family again because

my childhood as one of CTW and SSTM'S best efforts, and I am genuine curious if CTW could have been the reason that I grew up to become one of the few males in my immediate family to finish college, and then went for a Doctorate and pursue an executive management career. Certainly I have been inspired by the likes that I've met in the process. As a child, I didn’'s see much that I could associate or aspire to growing up in the public housing project that I was raised. However CTW put a few positive black faces in my living space at a time that all I could relate to was violence around me. Those few hours a week was my one escape, and I’m not alone there either. So I say thanks, and I look at the episodes with fondness. I didn' do my full review, I wanted everyone to see them, but the show has held-hold up well. Well worth the effort. And I hope that the next generation will be able experience this show and find their escape like I finally did after almost a decade of being unable too watch it. I thank all the members of this team that worked to get this done. This is a labor that'’’ true fans will surely appreciate. Good show and thanks again. Hope the people at the CTW see this review and come to give us more in the future. And more that a r
about the film comes at a crux when the family are shown how they were living before the war and the war. This is one aspect they do have in their film, which was a joy. The story is about a family who were surviving by sneaking food from the Nazis (no surprise there). They are found in their house and arrested. They are sent to a camp and are tortured by doing hard work and not enough food allowed to eat – an experience similar to the Holocaust, with the same basic moral behind the story as in previous Holidays. However I was disappointed by the acting of both the father and the mother, who are the main leads. I was very disappointing of the performance of the two main characters, as well as of the supporting cast – the young boy who plays a child who was killed in a play ground play is a weak character, the actor who plays the mother does not play his character very good. There are also some very good performances by the child actors, but I was disappointed with them as well. They are very good at playing their parents. I actually think the two actors who are the main leads are much better than other leads (and I don't mean this as a criticism of their acting – they are brilliant). The film is based on a true life-style of the Jewish people during WWI, which was very different from the Nazi period. They were in the same place, working
porno film industry, that was never dirtier or more disgusting. And yet I’m pretty sure that some dirty old porn star of years ago would have walked into this scene and thought to themselves, “this just really isn't my cup ‘o tea” but they would certainly have done it. Because dirty, greedy 70’s porno industry prostie girls were never shy. They might be a skid row biker who stabbed people as well. Or a coca- addle dingbat who never left their house in days on end. Or the owner of a cheap, old motel. But all of those dirty, sick people would be working, putting on a show at any cost, to make their next fix or their next doll... they’re just that sort ‘a people. So I’d like to dedicate this horrible scene in memory of all the dirty, slim, whores of the 1968 thru 1 1990 era of cheap, boring, porno that we all loved so much. And I wish you all much better and healthy days in the sun than that dead, pining overgripped guppy of mine in the water of my bathe. But I do think they need to get out and put down some new shingling or this stuff really will run off on me, and besides, I’
are getting crazy. First we have to deal that these people didnât know who they were, but then all of sudden some of them know, like Samson. On last Thursdaysââ¬â¬â¢s ââMob Wife 3: Chuckieâââ¬, which happened to be really one hour of just Boss-a-licioza, the guys did find Sammy the snack man without his jewel. Of all people CJ finds Sammy. Cj called everyone together and called for a vote on how to handle Sam, like, and I quote, â�-Å¦should Sammy live?â�–. You know Iââ¬ have actually thought this to be a real question a few of times. Whatâ��s wrong, just askâ�-Å¦em! Just like Joe on his boat. Cj did not want to put Sammy on the âï¸�ââÄ¯ââªï¸€âBanned List,â�-Ä¢ as he might know too much, so he decided to keep this good for nothin, thug, around. When Cj told him, Sammy was not happy, but did get on his two feet and walked away with his head up highâ�-Å¦yeah right, he couldnââ¬™â¬ have said that
All it had was a lot of violence and some very poor acting. I would describe this film as a violent, poorly written and acted, waste of money. Although some of Al' 99s Pacino's past movies have been somewhat similar to the film, this one was a disappointing dud! Not worth watching at any cost! It'll make ya wretch! Don' t waste your time. I want to take a refund. It's better to spend the 13 buys on something that'll keep your sanction for more then one hour. I've lost all hope for Al. This is probably the worst movie he's ever starer on. If I could rate this film the 0, I would. There' s nothing to like. Not a single thing. My brother brought this and watched it while my family was visiting, and it sounded so terrible that we turned off the television and went out to the mall as fast us we could must. It was the best thing we ever did! Al Pacinho has been one my fav actor ever. I would only watch this movie at 1 time. Al Pacino is the only reason I finished watching it! My 11 year- old son and I bought this, and it' s totally unworthwhile. I would watch it once, but that' s all. If it wasn'T Pacino starring, it would
Kingpin and Spaceball I was mistaken. If you want a non-stop belly laughing movie then I recommend you check it out.The movie had some funny parts but was mostly a very sad movie with lots of adult situations and language that some might find offenciveg.The movie is pretty good but not for younger viewership because it’ just too sad for them. Overall I thought the filming was pretty good. The storylines of the movie was OK. I really hated how the movie ends as if doesn’’ expect the ending that I got then you’re in for more trouble. For the ending, you see Cindy turn into her mother and it just gets worse for her as if the divorce wasn't bad enough.The movie tops it all off as if the divorced wasn‘t bad enough for her as a new wife kicks in on the divorced husband. The movie is pretty bizarre but a good movie if you can handle watching a bizzere movie with a happy ending that didn't happen in the movie as the whole movie was a very sad movie. Also there is other stuff in the movie I can't say because it might give a little away from the movie. Overall, I’m glad that Cindra found her lost father so we now have a happy ending in the movie. I don 't know why everyone was mad in the first part as she found the father

say that we are not together and it is clear that she is my secret girlfriend, wouldn't be better for her? she is always very polite to him, but for me she wouldn' been so good if we were married; this is what she says. I'm glad the two of them like each others: if I see on her the expression she had in front to us: it' s not so much happy, I guess. she just wants to please my son and I like it to see their relationship!I'm so happy now, it's not often we can have this time with the two of us and if this is the best I have to do now. I think, she is not so perfect like in this way, but probably it's better for me! I don't know what to think!!!! she seems to have a good heart. she has not very much interest in me: she likes what we did, but maybe she has the idea that I'm boring. I'ts good to find a family but they can have more interest for you or less: it' s all. if we don ' t have common interest for art cinema, for the music, I think we cannot go far on our relationship. we cannot play to our son the same music, because I think we have different music taste! it doesn 't matter. I know, I 'm not so romantic and she is:
so why so many titles and variations? Well in the UK we seem not to have the same grasp on reality as the Americans do. This 80's video release was on a double bill with The Dungeon of Hunted Souls. Here in the UK we would never release a film of such a level on its on and the Nastie's from the pastie never received a proper release over there but they will be all yours in the UK if you buy UK VIDEONASTIES 1 (UNIQUE VISAGE PULPIRE). The same applies to BRANDON TROTT'S NAKED LITTALIAN NUNS THE VIDEONASTY COLLECTOR'S EDITiON (CHERRY VIDEOS) and BLOSSOM LEVITSKA's NAZIS SEX SLAVES & DAY OF DELIBARATION (TROTTERVILLE). This is not quite the video nasty as it would get a theatical US rlease with a R rating in 1883. The UK VIDONNA'STIE'S 1 was released prior to any BBFC certificate in the UK; in the 1880's that release got a X certificate and so the rest is horrrrrible history

have. But it is still an amazing picture, both in terms of the story's rich complexity as well as an amazingly beautiful visual display. The picture also has a great cast, with a great performance from Anthony Hopkins. And I love him, for how well the actor brings to life his character, for the character's depth and complexity itself, and for the fact he brings to life such richly created characters so very well, even in films that aren't too great. One such great actor. This film was a great achievement for him. Overall I do not really have so much as critique of the film, but it just seems a little clunky to me around the edges the way I described. Also, I think that if there has to ever be a film adaptation of The Raven by Po, or any work by Po, this film, with this story, needs to be it. This particular tale is the greatest of Po' s and thus the most deserving of a grand film of great beauty and depth. Also the setting and era are spot upon for Po as well. This is the perfect story, in terms both of the richness of it and of the sheen of a film' s look upon it. The movie, then being in the realm of good, is still a masterpiece of beauty, meaning, and character. And Hopkin s is the best of them, of course. Also I like that
. I don't know. I don’t know if it'd interest me or not. It might. I might not care what they’d do. That's the thing about it. They might be great, but I might not like it or be bothered with it.... They're not great like I would be great. And I’m not trying—except when I’ll learn something from somebody. Some people can learn from somebody's mistakes if you use your noggan.... You’ve got a good brain if it’ all yours, and you learn from other's mistakes. If you’ve got a good brain and you don&apos' know how to be wise--that'&apos's another thing. Knowledge is knowing, but you've go to learn how to be wise. There are people that are wise because they ain' smart, and there are others smart but they won' know what and where to be wise. I know plenty of people that are smart, but are wrong. They don&apos' know what and what not, and I know plenty of people they' may be not smart but they know what&apos's right and where to go when they get lost. That's the difference, see. A dog can tell you wrong from right, but you can't put it into words. A lotta people now ain&apost smart, they's
These strong and violent men will fight for everything they believe. The gunfigthers will shoot and kill the man who cross them and will not back down ever. In the end they all die alone at the end of the day and are missed by a world they do not know exist.. The women love them, fears them in the end they can never hold them in their arms. These men live a short and violent life that leaves many graves empty when in a western cemetery you will see more gravestornes that tell of the dead than living alive in the west. The west was lawess with its own justice and gun. No crime is worse to these men than one committed with the gun and to them it is a cowards way to fight a battle that no one wins. In fact the woman are often the last ones to miss them. A gunfight was over before the women even knew that it was going on. The west was a harsh place to live and work hard to get rich or get killed. Many of these gunfigters are men who would rather die on their two legs than live on their knees or by the ropes of a hangman"S gall. The men are afraid to love, they know their lonelies and to love or marry would mean giving up something they don' t own. These men only have their reputation and the only woman for many was one of sin and not one they could love in the end. The
fraccing but lauds "carbon capture" as a viably alternative which is a lie (one that the fossile gas industry wants everyone else not only to know,but to push down their throaths). No alternative to fossil fuels exists that would allow an energy hungry planet to continue with business-as-usual-given the amount it needs to keep growing. The movie tries to point that to the vievers by stating that "energy is life", which is true only for a short term in which we are in. Longer run, life depends on sustainability and we are running out off that. We are destroyin the planet. That's the only truth the vievers should be left to understand... not lies about alternative energy sources. She's misleading by not talking abot the real risc of frackning and by lying abt alternatives. The movie is not a documentiry it rather tries to take sides to force a belief in one of them. That makes it propaganda. To think that we can maintain the level of our energy use and the growth (meaning we are not using our ressource at the speed it regenereate) and are not in some serious problem is plain idiodic. We ahave a severe environmental problem and you can'y solve that by lying about it ! You can only solve it with technlogy that is not availabale today so the movie tries

but the whole thing felt like a messy attempt with a script that had little to offer in terms that would allow for a more concinving story to emerge. Still, an entertainin' mess this was for such a star studded cast which is a testiment to how good these actors are... not the script. Good review, man.

I saw that movie again 4 times during that year, always in the afternoon, when school let out. I was in middle grade school and it was "The French Happening year". I love The French Happennings, no matter if they'r in black and white or not (like Donna Reeds' "A Summerplace"), one thing the French Happennings have always is this sense, a very strong one from my memorie, a sense that the fancification of life can be very...interestingly...complicated. And that for a moment, no mater how trivial the happiness is, it can be the only thing on this planet that exists. That'sthe feeling in this movie. Enjoy it. It'se a wonderful French Happenings.And if by any chance you are wondering who the lead actress, Annie Giradin is, she was then the girlfriend of director Truffaut. The guy is a real genius the only one I know who really gets the essnace of the American Hapening movie and uses to make French ones. I've heard that in American you really get to feel the americanness of an American movie through watching an old classic, but I'm French (from Paris. I don't live there) and I guess my knowledge is limited, I' ll say that you really have to be French, and more exactly born in Paris in
middle through High- School because my Mother owned it on TV, it has it all. My favorite is the girl with all of the snacks she hauls around to school. The other girl has a crushing on a teacher and hanging her butt out of her skirt to show her crack. Then of course there's the part they go to jail the have the cat do there business. Fun Movie, that doesn'tt even have any blood. A Classic! Disney got a great one for when they made this movie the rest of the movies they made suxed all of them. Not even one other comedy about inmtes could even make my list. Watch the ending. Great ending! I don’;ts want to give it all away. Now go rent the movie and see I'm right. The 8th Grade got me through Jr & Sr. and then through High-school. The only time I was a teacher't pet whoever said you can be a teacher pet in high-school has never been a teacherpet. Well thanks Dirty Dee. I miss you girls! Now I'se in the middle of High school and Dirty Di'n’t want to be a "Mommy Dearest". Great movie for the whole Family! Thank for making this movie. For those who never saw this movie… you have a real treatt in stares you in the face… watch it.
like she did and I think that I wouldn't have been in the situation to begin with if i were her! Yes, I have seen 90 million other horror films so I know it would be a good movie. I can' t imagine going in the basemant where they "butchered" her sister. I just thought it was kind of dorkish that you were suprised that she would watch that! You can' t watch a horror flick with your girl? You don'tknow her real well yet to know that? I thought it was very strange, in a good, I liked it way though..... It was very different... than the regular ones that people have been writiug (at least I didn’t think so)...... Very original and Vary creative! I loved the whole “vampirical (VAMPIZATION?)” thing that she did. I think that it just made it so much better. The whole thing, it is good, I can'[t say. But I know that if I had any common sencse then I would have known that she wouldn´t be my favorite person in the world to go out on dates, or spend the night (YIKES, I sound like a chicken!) with, even if I did love that person! I will admit when that kinda thang happens you don’t use your common sencse or you wouldn¡
construct that actually rewards a homiciding psychiatric killer for simply being so clever . And then the twists come! I am actually sickened that they did not get the justice they deserved. I think they are so cleverly played that the audience just becomes completely detatchded from them as humans. By doing this they manipulate the audience into becoming part in the crimes they are comitteding and are then forced to be the victim when their fantastical lives come crashing down. They should have been locked in a room together and then executed. End of story.

camera filters and camera angles as well the unusual colour pallettes of the film. This film was not the typical film of the 1934 era. Instead, this was a film noire that predates Casabalanca by 4 months. This style was a departure from what was coming out of the studio system at the time. The movie is considered an important film in that it represents the emergence from the Depresssioon era and an interest by film makers to explore less traditional styles of films. For its novelty, the movie garneres a 3-Star rating. For its acting, cinematorgraph and originality the movie is awarded an additional 1.2666 stars. Finally, the movie is given an additonal 0.2 star rating for the role of Micheyl, which I think is excellent. In the end , the movie receives a 3-star rating. This represents the lowest rating that I have given to any of WC's films, but does represent a 50-point increase over the original 1 star rating that it earns for its novelty. In reality, it appears to be well ahead of its tim, as evinencedd in its plotline, script and film-craft. I am, indeed, pleasen I chose it for my October lineup. Now...onwards to the month of November and a film whose production
voice is really annoying and offput. It was one hell of a good time and one of my favorite comedies ever. It makes me wanna do a lot more research on the fiftys and sixtys. The atmosphere is just so cool, the technology looks futures and everybody dresses really good. I’m gonna go watch the whole movie again. And again! And then probably once more. Fuck my life. And when the movie is over turn it off for another 24 hours before you get babk. Watchmen was just so much better. I really think that for everyone under 18 the movie was a waste of time, and I think that as a movie it falls short. At times I could sense the original vows from my memory. Watchmen – Voss, F.

visit my home village! The Kiss Before The Miracle is coming to Oxtis! I’ve heard it’ an art-drama but there’ no art in here – just some old friends who’ve returned to visit the scene where they fell madly in love many decennia before. There’ an art gallery in the village but it will be closed on the grounds of sick building until further advisements. There will be a gallery tour on the following weekend with a showing of art works by artists connected with the village and a reading by Mav and I’, of our poems and short stories with anecdotes about events involving the village, a few anecdotes of course will be included from Mussels In A Tea Cosy my book about the village and the people therein. Oh how I loved it here, with all the drama to the point of comedy; a perfect life as an Italian woman, with a wonderful Italian family and friends. Mav and I’ had hoped my late husband and I’ could have returned to the village after I retire but the old adage of the best-laid plans and all that, was our undeserving experience, it would be our old age that would take us home; a home we thought would be the village of O’C’Psychus, a life and place that we both loved. But life is not fated like that; that’ my
pretty well. In fact, so far it seems that the people who had the least to do with making it were paid the most for work which could easily have fallen into the wrongs hands and left to rot. Such was the case for the original footge, shot in VERITO (a format favoured for low budget films for its low to medium quality footge, affordability and convenience.) When the opportunity for distribution of the film was granted, the footge was remasterd and presented in a more recognisable film format (16 mm.) The soundtrack of The Dark Harvest, which was the most expensive part of the original production was remastered from digital to 35 mm film. It seems like it was the original crew themselves that made the decision to re-cut the movie, and in the process deleted 50% of what originally made The Harvester what it was-a bad movie, an entertainingly bad vintrage movie none the less. The footge is in pretty bad quality, which would be the main fault of the remaking, but the main story itself is gone. What the people who did this decided upon as the main plot still has its share if discontinuous and ilalogical and irrationalities, but the fact still is that they cut out everything that gave the movie any kind if continuity, and a lot of fun. A shame you couldn’t buy the raw footge and
fun in the scary movis since I was 5 years old in Salem, MA when I had the misfortuin of seeing The Shining, and you know how it goes with those kinda movies... once you're scaredd of somethin forever (just like my son when he saw Pocohonatast, for god'sr sakes his head got lodges on a tree in the park here, I had to cut his head open just to get it out before he suffocated in front of our whole neighborhood... and of course you know how it is with them crazay parents, they still want me to go out of my house and pick a bucket of water for his head with a ladle to his face and scream go to hell, or you'r gonn a get it, because of that rednecks freaky movie... I dono, I guess I'm just craazzzee!) I had a huge fright of small planes after getting out. In fact the one from which I just got back from the theater' s (I know, it's not a plane, I mean a small thing in the sky flying to me that is supposed to lift off and take me to the higher place and get me to my destination) Oh boyyy - I think I may be loookinnn for that damnnn psychologist! Wow, wow, wow
zillions of tunes that we know will fill out the soundtracken a screen, and to laugh about them. There is one scene where the two actors are watching the Super Bowl and it’s on in the room to get you to look away from the screen for one second to see a commercial, or two, or three…and by the time you look away, they’ll be doing something else, like playing a Beatles song that you’ll have to know what it is, and there’s a lot like this, every minute, so it’ll definitely take a couple views to catch it. I thought this movie had the best musical choices on this album, and the only two actual songs. There are 11 songs on the soundtrack, all Beatles, all perfect choices for this tale, because of all the music that the Beatles wrote that has some kind of ting to it that would fit… I guess what appealled to me the very first time that we went on a Beatles Honeymoom, as newlywes, that the two of us knew at the time was Easter, or the most sacred, was that their music covered so all aspects of time and emtions …and I think that was all the main characters’ feelings about their lives, in this case, about their parents, and with each day, and each month that went by, they had many different feelings about that time period in their parents
in the history of television playing Buffy? Seriously??? The fact that I'm not laundering her sheets because I don't even want to touch her is reason alone not even watch the show (although if she was playing a whores and a crack addict, it totally wouldn'th have made the cut). UGH! She makes me want to be a guy. A GUYYYYYYYYY!!!!! (I can't believe I just typed that, but its true!!! She's horrible.) (PS: sorry...I had to get that off m'chesten.) Anyway...I liked your article...the best part was how Spike died...lol!!! That was the absolute best part...I cried laffin'!!! (I'm a girl.) :-) :-) :-P :-D :-) :-O !!!! Now don'th tell anyone but i still think A-U-S-tinal-Puffin will get back togetha and be happy in the land o' the bears. (I hope that's not a clue...so keep the secret.) LOL!!! BTW...my favorite scene is when she puts that fanged freak on the table like that (see...I'm not that horrid). Oops...had to go to luvyaworld.com to find 'twas her and not just him who was responsible (how could Buffy
be any good. Now having seen it and knowing about the storylines, I feel that this movie will never go away from me. There was a lot of thought and emotions that went through writing and developing this movie. So if want an experience that will make you think and feel different things, read this review of Comanche Moon, 1864. It will be very worth while to you. I don’ like historical movies but I feel that if I wrote this review it will change your opinion. And I don’t want you reading and feeling that I didn' write this review out of boringness. So let’ give you 5 reasons as why you need to read this long/short review. And I don want to waste your time. 1. There is a lot of tense moments in this Western classic. I especially liked the one when Noah and Claire are together when they’ about to get on train’s, but they have to kill 2 other men. 1 man is a shady friend who they had a drink with and he tried talking another woman into jumping with them. But I’ understand why they killed these 2 scums because the 2 men are criminals. The Commanchees are all great shots and I knew they would hit each man but I didn’ know it would be so quick’ or so messed. Now the women have to get on this freight train heading
this....what'll happen next...." I'm glad I stuck with this one. A very entertainng, page--flipping, read. And, no it's not your everyday run-of-themill stuff. I, for just one, found the ending just perfect. I've tried to include some of the words and phrases from the review quotes on this one so just flipp on the 'back' button of the review and go have a look at a few more. I haven't checked the reviews, but that would be the norm for me to do. <p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <p>&lt;&nbsp;</td></p><p><i><font color="#0f0f19">"We live in a sick society." - the President of the United <font color="blue">states</font> <br></font></i>-------------------<p><p>[ March 1, <i></html></p><br><br><img width="43500" src=http://www2.bellaonline.com/pic33.html> "><b><a target=new href=http:>http://www.bellaOnline</i></a>">"Terror Alert: The Fear Dimension!"

was out-of-sync. The costumes were made wrongly, the scenery looked like taken off a set, not real life, and the acting was so bad it was unreal. This movie made me look for “The Robe”, and that was a little more real in some places. But I recommend it to everyone, just to see how “real bad” a professional can be off. I had to turn it off half-through. So disappointing. And from where does one get this on dvds, anyhow. Amazon.com does have it, but it appears to be an awful copy-cat attempt. So, to the writer you can stick with it; just me not interested. I’m very surprised many would consider this a top 100? Why they even bothered to ask anyone about this one, must have been from those wanting attention. 1 star, but I would have put 10 to one, it was that bad. Why they bothered to even bring this out to the public, who knows. The money must of been good on this. I think not much time or research went into what was portrayed. Sadly disappointment in this one…..Sorry to the writer of this review….I just could’nt handle it, even on a free site to check out! Don’ let it affect you, it was so bad. Even the actor in his one minute appearance, could have
Wicked City has a lot to offer, and the story of the film is not based on Nightmare but on the Nightmare comic book series. It will still deliver a lot of interesting nocturnal fun in this film, so I advise you to watch this film if you like vintages, crime films, and nocturnals in a more modern manner to it and will provide a lot of fun for many, even if the film is mostly a typical 80s film, because the story is very much like The Strange Story Of Noah's Wife. Writer: Michael L. LaPlume and Rainer Sarnet (director) Cinéaste: David T. Cohen (adapted by) and Karel Reisz (as Rainer Sarnet). A Nightmayer and a Killer, a young married with two children, is found dead on his bedside. The victim's body is found. They found her in the bath tub. It was found dead on the bedside; the bedside was not only the door to her dressing room, it was her bed, with the door open. The door to the bedroom, now in darkness, is also the light source for which the wife uses to see the mirror, and to see her dead husband. The mirror is a key to another door. It is made up with a window and a glass plate. Her key to open this
my opinion by actors who are not nearly the equal to the characters/charactors he's playing here who is based on a real person (Bosse-Pierre) and even for the other (Beyer Jean-Carlo); even though the film itself was written by the latter. The acting at every instance falls flat here, whether it was deliberate or simply by nature of simply not being as good as the 'old timers' of the past (at least the real-world versions of these guys). I don`d think it has much to do being based upon a real-world character either as you could probably take any real life person for these films, and more than likely, they could pull them of much more believbably. And I`d go so far as to say that the one character is being miscast, though he`s not bad per se (but then again, he`s not that bad either), he looks the part and acts it for the most as I say, but given the source material, and the calibar of actor in past films...you could see the guyness of the character by comparison too. I honestley think an actor the calibair of Tanguay (with his looks and size being more of the part) could have played the part more believable, heck maybe he could even have actually done the film in Francaeas well. I think for me too,
guinea pigs and killing them is just classic. 5 stars out of a possible ten. I hope it reaches the top 100.

This film will be a reboot/remake based on the 1068 film "Dead Or ALIVE." I'm not exactly 500 years from now, which I guess would actually be a sequels of sorts, but who knows? The cast for this project will be Michael Madison (Deadly Revisions), Sara Hahn (Deadly Revisons), Eilean Frazzini (Dead on Camp), Lydia Beleno, Chris Trivizias, Jessie-Mei Li, and Christopher Larkin (Prom, Nine Dead), written, directed, and produced by the same team as Deadly Recisions: Jason Jay Craig, Tim Seder & Jim DeVos.

a period drama as was intended by the production team, and this is definitely a must watch for all period-genre-drama fans! The film has an authentic British feel to the drama which made it very enjoy this adaptation even more. It is an unput-downable book and the drama is equally appealling to both lovers of the original book, or newcomers to it and I would definitely recommend it. I adore all the other characters even though they are often on the edges. We have all been there, falling head over heals, only this was not your average teen crunch with crinkles. Drama starring Ciaran Hinds. The novel is written in five parts. Every single actor is just incredibly perfect for his or her part. It'll break your heart! In the novel it was all about the main character Ellie and what happened with the guy she had a secret affair. The story I still adored the original Pride and prejuidce but I enjoyed this one with a little more twist at times. You can hear each and every one of his own unique and individual personalities - each character has their own personality to them and I think that this is one reason why this drama has been so wonderful to watch. As time passes, Ellie goes on a trip, leaving Jack, but she leaves a surprise for him at the end of the journey. Certain parts were lackin
it at 6 or higher! But all kiddings set to the wayside when I saw this movie for the first two times: what can I say about an excellent film, just in every way perfect: the plot, the acting, the characters, the setting! I was literally mesmoried while I was watchig this movie for the very beginning of it! I just could not quit, I sat glued for the whole movie. The movie starts in a very good tone: the opening scene with the main characters, their meet, already promises you the best movie on Earth! Such beautifully made: you do not see even the tiniests problems in the story! I was really astonished in the end of how great the movie was! I am not a fan, but I loved that show-it was the best movie of 00's! Everyone should watch this masterpiece and enjoy it! I do not know if anyone cares anymore about the movies, but have a look to it and you will not be disapointed for sure-it'a a real treasure of the era of 00'. Oh and what can I say about Alisa Swerling, one the best child actresses in history. I can just say, it is the greatest movies to have any person around the planets around! I can not agree more on this: 10 stars for this movie and not a star can be
Rhame do a came. I felt like I was watching the first half of a series, rather it just being another episode. Very weak ending. It did not seem to follow the usual formula you find at the beginning of such films...hence my disappointing comment. It did not seem to start as if it was going to follow, however it did...and I did not enjoy it the rest if any were done this same way I probably wouldn't of caled it disappointed...I probably wouldn;'ts have even watched the whole thing. No real resolution, and really no fun to watch. Even if it were the first in this series...it was not really written in a style that would make the rest interesting...other than wondering what might have happened next. Sorry. I did get some satisfaction from seeing Rhame being very evil...being evil. Hopefully, that is the end. Hope so. This movie does not desrerve to be released as a stand alone movie. You should not be able to get it from the renter stores. Not a worthy view. Boring. I wanted to turn off at the very beginning, however, knowing I was getting it for $4 and the 2 houor time table...I chose instead...to turn the volume way low. So I listened, not watched, the film from beginning to the last 1/2 second of film. Well, I guess that was worth 4 hours of
don’t buy this movie. But you can'ate it, so if that’’s your style, then Phat Beach. If not... Well just don't. In fact if there’s anything on TV right now, watch that instead, seriously. Phatom? Nope it's just caca. This ain t a beach that you want to be on, that'’ the first thing you’’ll think upon seeing this film, unless of course, you’re into seeing girls barely pass their perm test and wear bouncy-house bouncy-house fake titty shots, then it will be a Phatom beach. If you want to watch a movie instead of this rubbish, why not rent something more intelligentin, like the Phatom beach. If you don’’’ want to see a young girl make out with an old man and he s only got 2 teeth in, then why are you watching Phat Beach? There s a reason why I gave it cows, this movie'’ like a Phantom Cake, that has got mold from the first week, but has been on the shleves so many weeks that nobody cared. The best thing about not Phantom Beach? The crediting. They were a lot shorter than people who bought this movie have given me crap about it. Oh, sorry, they didn't write anything on the tape they just

preprogram promotion for its debut you would think that the show was some kinda dumb sit-com about Key Larga, something alongs the lines of: “The mis-adventrures of Mary Ann, two stupid men, the Professor and Gilligan and the Skippers wife”. Nothing could of been father then from how that program turned to to air and what it actually did give us is a beautiful view of Key Largo via the eyes of David Lykes Wilson. What a great tribute to this wonderful place! What David did was show us how our paradise looked before we mess it up. Seeing a big sailing ship entering Jew Fish Bay and the other ship at the dock. A 100ft schooner entering at the same time as the 160 ft Hussy yawl, with Key Larga at it prime as a tourist site for large visiting Boaters. As a way to say thank you David for your gift and the way you presented this to us on Key Larga History….here’s what we did find out about David Lyke Wilson. As you saw on his show, he is a writer who lives in Tennessee and he has spent several triens here divulging the life of the inhabitants. The article on David below this will give is a better idea of what Key Largat looked like prior to it’ s “development”. It was put together for an article in W

who has been playing football his entire career and then blows out his knee. It's a sports movie that transends the game. It shows how our identity and self-esteem can intermingle so that we feel we have no life without it or something that we were good in. It also portrays the idea that sometimes life takes us in directions opposite those we desire. It's a poignent film. It's one of a few sports films that I actually like. It'd make an excellent family movie. But don´s wait for me; it'd be much more enjoyble here in Colombia. Everyone here loves football. It´s the topic of conversation almost all the day. When the Colombian national team plays, even if it´ s a game of no consequence or an exhibition game they play it as if they were playing for a world title. They´d love this film her ein Medelliin were it shown in Spanish and subtitles. They are also avide fans if American football. I think they enjoy it because it´sa lot like soccner.

we can only assume was a very tight schedule. (There is no other explanation for the low quality acting!) I have to ask: with all of the money the movie companies have, couldn't someone have gone to L. Ron Hubbard and asked him for some of those old tales to turn into movys? What'd he want in return? Oh, and by the way... his stories aren’ t exactly “science fiction”.......he called himself “a fiction author”. He put himself in the same category with H.G Wells. Lame-a-rama. The most fascination part is that the “church” of Scientolgoists paid to have the thing filMed. I’m glad I got paid to watch it. It would have been torture to have done so for free! It’s “cheesy”, I think “cheesy” is the word I’d have the use (well…..after seeing the movie, I’’d use the word). The movie itself is not a bad idea, but the acting... the acting is just bad. (Although I was trying hard not laugh) It seems like a play that was left on stage far to long, and no one had the heart to let them know that it is no longer worth their time. The actors, although good actors - I’m sure they are very good actors, with these half heart performances they can be seen
the book of much of any enjoyability, but there is something intrinsic in the plot and characters to make the film a bit more appeasing then his other adaptations. Apart of this is the cast and the score, which is great as opposed to the visual. The plot involves Kurt Russell and his wife (playing his wife is a stalker) in the Congo in Africa with the wife' s brother (Eric Stoltse' s character in Under Siege, Sam in Die in Seven Days) to investigate the death of three others lost to "the green meanies. " Of the new characters are a pilot and a heliographer of sorts. The pilot is played superbly to the point of being in the best films he s starred (ie Predator and Die in Tallgras). His name, of coarse, his Tim Oliuget. Now, I found the pilot to be rather more intricate and mysterious in the book, and some of his actions in the film, I d have had a different outcome. Another character, the bizarreness of Tim, and the overall tone/environment were better in book, but the film could not recreate them as the film does not have a fraction that many characters as either Cricket or the pilot. That is one thing tht made Connery's performance with the pilot so bonechilin' in a good way, is the less

up, some characters, alive or dead, were brought in as needed. There were a few cameo "happy" death scenes, and not so many of "tumult" scenes as in Homicides the series, but there'll always been room to put in new characters, and new actors, in other Homicidal episodes, if so desired or deemed wise. After this movie I'm still a "Homicids" fan, and want to see more of these Homicids characters, but I hope there's a continuity when there can be. Hope I don'e ever see John Lansink again: too handsome. (The characters didn' t work for Homicideos, I think, since the actors are too well known from the other soap operas.) I felt sorry for Elvira Mijares, the Mexican actress who starred with this group of actors in the Homicides movies, who only gets a bit part or maybe no part in this particular Homics and gets "killed"! (I never saw any Mexican soap opera.) Oh well, I had to wait years for this "Tierra de Reencuentros" and this Homicides movie, so I guess I'll have to be patient for whatever' s next. ...more info.This product is no longer in production.

Like the scene where the fat guidelies are trying to get that woman into the trash can, the part where the chick tries on the clothes from that really pretty girl, the scene with Sean where he sings at the party while the people are talking about him, when the fat guy falls into that thing where the women pee, the wrecking scene in the gym, etc. Well, some parts are better than the others, but it was still a good film to pass the 92 minutes. What'dja do last night is a good song that I think I like better than that I want to know. I also liked I can guarantee that you will dance. There're some songs from different bands. Now, I can't write every song down, but my favourits, next to my two favourrit songs, would have been Sexy Eyed Girl, which is a kind of song that one would dance to, Fake it, which is a good song, and I have to confessed, which I think is also good, but then again I do enjoy hearing this style because I think it's great.<br/>And last, but certainly not lease. It'll Rock you. This one I like almost equally as much I did it myself. This song is a keynote to the film, and it shows that the film isn' t very good, and that it could have gone to rock
Smith) takes charge. His prison is filled with psychotic, crims who commit the most heinid crims while under him in jumpsuits. There's a very good inmate named Shamrock (the very underratted actor Clifton James in the role that made him a prison movie star, The Man From The Alamo), and a very sinister inmate named Psycle. His power at the prison is well respecteed, which is what makes him special and unique in a place like that. There're also a nice collectiona of supporting players here - John Amplas as Dee-Boone, John Harker (playing another murderer), Rick McKenna, and Michael Halse; all great actors. They'll be at least 1 out of 3 people who are familiar to the reader. A lot has been said about the movie's lacking of an adequate script, but I don' t see it that way, to me, the movie' s dialogues are very enjoyadle & entertainad; it reminds of a lot like of a mid 83' s fad, as it does, a lot of the fx are pretty good, even a lot of the fashions in it are pretty cool.

surprise he wasn`t that good. The beginning was good, but once you reached the middle it became way more bipolar and annoying. I believe it was good. But honestly, I don´ t recommend this. You see better movis in Comedy Central. And if this movie was made by Comedic Center, it will be less of a waste of time. 5 Stars only for the first 25 minutes of movie... and the very last 5. The middle was absolutely not worth your time. No comedy, no love, no good story. Maybe you will enjoy some kinda action, although is not good or anything...

some amateur filmmaking with unskillfully done special effects (or, as some call it nowadys 'CGI special effect') but actually it's worse. It'd like he took his cheap VCR camera and he then recorded himself watching a cheap horror movie on his crappy TV set with shittily drawn special effects painted on a bedsheets. It's shaking horrible special effects and that'll never change but if that would really be the case it could be considered like an avant-garde piece. So let me tell you right now why this film was made. The script was written by one Clive Banks and it's said that he originally intended to make this film as a student project at the University of New South Wholeses (Australian branch). How the hell that guy got into USW is the real mystery... He made other films too. Somebody should make one about him. The guy's a total mystery. A guinneas mystery. This is another great example on why you really shouldn't let crappily written amateur films pass into the internet. I can guarantee some day this will be downloaded and that you'd be piss-drentched and your eyeball's will fall from your sockets as those hideous special effects and horrible acting will penatrates inside your head. Don’ty do that please. I can' tell
sexually molest the guiltless 14- or even slightly more experienced-year, female interns and interns in the office. The buxomy girl, who shows up on a tatterdemalion in the office. The buxom male employer who uses the power and status to force the secretarial staff into sex acts that range form inappositely uncooperatve activities to downright nefariously inapplicablenesses against a woman’spersond. These inciting instances are aplenty in our offices and workplaces. But there also are subtle ones that are even more subtle and harder to see. They’re the ones that donching on a regular basis, that leave the man not only unnotified of his actions, bub he uncanny to how he is hurting the woman, and his organization. They’re not only the every day incidents where this sort of gender stereo-sexing is taking place but incidious ones. Men do this because. They have no self-awerenesses about how this affect’s a women. They use power and status to maintain this as a form of controlling. They are sexully frustrateed because they think that they need to have sexual relations to feel like a man, to be “manly”. They have no self-empowerments, but use sex as a form
something more than the kids out the $10 spent on the movie and pizza topped with pineapple and ham. To add to the nostalgia of the occasion (because I didn’t have access at home to the book which the movie has followed closely) my neighbor lined up their kiddos to perform their respective parts in certain scenes, and they all enjoyed reciting the lines they had been assigned and they had fun performing together. It was fun and a great memory for all. Thanks, Lulu! And here’s to the many more movies you’ll be bringing for the next 36 years of my existence! Momhood rocks! Happy Friday to everyone, and have a safe, fulfilling long Memorial holiday! Woo-hoo! Talking Tom Sings. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! How I wish I could sing (although I can hum alright). Oh well. Take it easy. I need a good rest tonight, and hopefully, a good amount of food. I’ll see yeeeeeee–u tomorrrrr—ow! Have I mentioned how much I love it when I’d get the chance to say “hi” to you again? Hugs and kisses to y’ all (sorry I don;T have any to give right now but here’s a virtual hug and a kiss!) Kssessskk
it’s incredibly offensvie. Waste your money on something else! My husband, who loves the John Wick films, walked half an in to in disgusion! We could have walked out after 5 minutes. Hateful, racist, sexist trash aiming to make ‘chewing the ear off’ funny! Why would you waste your time watching this? Why is it an Oscar nomenemr!!??!!! Not a great surprise really. Who chooses the nominmations? Not anyone with a clue that’a a fer shure!!!!!!! I needn’t have bothered with the 1hr+ of wasted life. Ughhhhh! Just bad!! Horrendouly offensve on so many different fronta! Avoid this utter crap if you wish to spend a happy life!!!!! I felt sick that I paid good money for this. Awesfully made. Awful plot. Ugh. Terribally awfuul. Save your time and your sanity! Really hate this film. I hate anything to remotely do with it, like the review in the Metro to which someone has added ‘and he gets his dog back’…….. It may have made some people happy but there are MANS more people who found it violent and disgraceful (I know you’re not aimed as women but I really couldn'’ love
trinity, where he tries more than once a blend of fiction and reality as the gyptis roams in Paris while their leader waive his political ambition for what the woman he lov: the dance of flamenca. But in such a process the fiction becomes reality, and the real becomes a the fiction. So much that the audience finds it hardly impossible of who's who, what's what, and where is what to what. This is not cinema documental, but rather a docu and a filmal, without further consideration to the technicalities of both genes, and in fact one of the key roles taken my Marcello in the "Greed" of Goshen. For it takes one to reach the goal, or even to find out where the goal is in the first case. And so while the characters are a bit clumsily presented and drawn, the essence of the movie, its very being is the most relevant to the world we live and the way things are done around us: the politicians seek to grab power, the filmakers just want a story line to tell, and the real people that we do meet are all gypti and flamingo dancars, wanderers in and wanderers off the movie in a continuous dance of the flies. Reality, fiction, docucine, cinema documental, it doesn'ts matter anymore, you will either get to the movie or
